<en>{Ran}\n"Umm, not really.\nIt's a small island so I'm already tired of this place."
<es>

@11
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I guess so."
<es>

@12
<en>It's an island where you could go around within half a day.\nOther than the city and the schools, everything else is the green forest.

<es>

<en>Rin brought me to a bathing room.\nIt was the women's side.
<es>

@34
<en>Ofcoursethere will be no girls who would come in in the middle of the afternoon.
<es>

<es>

@36
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What now?\nAre you going to make me clean this place?"
<es>

@39
<en>{Ran}\n"Shh!\nIf you talk we'll get caught Keep it quiet."

<en>Ran pushed my head down and I ducked.\nI lowered my head and watched from the shadowThen the two came in immediately
<es>

@53
<en>It was Sakura and Rin.
<es>

@58
<en>{Sakura}\n"It's okay There's no one here at this time.\nYou don't have to hide yourself with a towel."
<es>

@59
<en>{Rin}\n"But, it's bright and embarassing......"
<es>

@60
<en>{Sakura}\n"What are you talking about?"
<es>

@62
<en>It's only within us so hurry up.
<es>

@63
<en>It seems like Sakura forcefully pulled Rin out.
<es>

@64
<en>{Kazushi}\n"H Hey this is not good.\nLet's sneak out."
<es>

@65
<en>{Ran}\n"What are yo talking about?\nYou would never have this kind of opportunity.\nJust watch."
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Even though you say to just watch......"
<es>

@67
<en>There's two naked classmates in front of me.\nAnd they're pretty.\nOfcourse I want to see.
<es>

@68
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, peaking isn't good."
<es>

@69
<en>{Ran}\n"Rin's breasts are nice as usual.\nWith that face and her naughty body."
<es>

@70
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Re, really?"
<es>

@71
<en>But......I want to see.
<es>

@72
<en>Darn, my head is full with desire to look.
<es>

@73
<en>{Ran}\n"When she goes in with me, she always hides her body, but we could look all we want today.She's so weird. She doesn't need to hide it if it's just between girls."
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Isn't because there's someone that always looks just like you?"
<es>

@75
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmm, Sakura is pretty nice too.\nShe has a butt I want to just bite on.\nGosh it's so nice."
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're a guy.\nYou're definitely a guy."
<es>

@77
<en>She's concentrating on their body more than me.And with a face that would start drooling.
<es>

@78
<en>{Ran}\n"You should be looking too Kazushi.\nHey, look look."
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What......wow......"
<es>

@80
<en>{Rin}\n"HeySakurastop......"
<es>

@81
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow......"
<es>

@82
<en>Sakura touched Rin's breast.\nJust by the looking at the finger I was able to imagine the softness and get dizzy because of it.
<es>

@83
<en>{Rin}\n"Hey, dont touch there......"
<es>

@84
<en>{Sakura}\n"Why not.\nIt's just between us."
<es>

@85
<en>{Rin}\n"Isn't wrong because it's between girls.\nIt's weird."
<es>

@86
<en>{Sakura}\n"Is it?\nSo you're okay with a guy then?\nYou'll let guys do sexual things?"
<es>

@87
<en>{Rin}\n"I'm not saying that......If it's a guy I like then I'll probably let him......"
<es>

@88
<en>......I started getting dizzy. The conversatition is getting more realistic. If this kind of conversation continues, I can't keep my mind straight.
<es>

@90
<en>{Sakura}\n"SoWhich guy from our class would you let touch you?"
<es>

@91
<en>It's a topic that I want to hear.\nRan seemed to tease me by taking a quick look at me.
<es>

@92
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, you look very interested.\nAre you expecting that she might choose you?"
<es>

@93
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's okay right.\nI'm curious.\nMaybe I will get chosen."
<es>

@94
<en>{Ran}\n"Hahaha, there's no way.\nKazushi, you're a nice guy, but for a guy you seem unreliable."
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shut up"
<es>

@96
<en>{Rin}\n"The guys in the class seems unreliable.\nOlder guys seem like they're more reliable."
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Darn, so it is......"
<es>

@98
<en>It was just how Ran thought.\nRan had a smile of victory.
<es>

@99
<en>{Sakura}\n"How about an upper class men or a teacher?\nLike Mr.Yagami?"
<es>

@100
<en>{Rin}\n"He's hot, but he says he has a wife."
<es>

@101
<en>{Sakura}\n"Then an upper class men?"
<es>

@102
<en>{Rin}\n"I think Panchu- is good looking"
<es>

@103
<en>Wow Panchu-.\nRin has good taste.
<es>

@104
<en>{Sakura}\n"But, I don't know what he's talking about and isn't he scary?"
<es>

@105
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sakura doesn't know anything."
<es>

@106
<en>{Rin}\n"But, if you look closely he has very kind eyes."
<es>

@107
<en>{Sakura}\n"Really? He's so scary I never looked."
<es>

@108
<en>Well yeah, I even never looked at his face that closely.
<es>

@109
<en>Rin might be a really good person at judging.
<es>

@110
<en>{Sakura}\n"How about the guys from our class? Like Harruchi?"
<es>

@111
<en>Oh its me.
<es>

@112
<en>{Rin}\n"Haruma-kun......is a nice guy."
<es>

@113
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It sounds like a pathetic rating."
<es>

@114
<en>{Ran}\n"Most of the time nice guys are not good.\nToo bad."
<es>

@115
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Stop getting happy. It's weird."
<es>

@116
<en>I want to go home.\nWhy am I even here?
<es>

@117
<en>{Rin}\n"How about Sakura?\nYou're in good terms with Haruma-kun."
<es>

@118
<en>{Sakura}\n"Yeah, I get along with him.\nHe's easy to talk to."
<es>

@119
<en>{Rin}\n"You guys are always joking around."
<es>

@120
<en>{Sakura}\n"I'm not thinking of him in any bad way."
<es>

@121
<en>I'm not thinking of Sakura in a bad way either.\nBut, maybe I don't have any guy charm.\nI'm have to think.
<es>

@122
<en>{Rin}\n"But, aren't those kind of cases where you're attracted to each other but you don't realize it?\nYou know like knowing each other for a long time."
<es>

@123
<en>{Sakura}\n"Ohh I see"
<es>

@124
<en>I see?
<es>

@125
<en>{Sakura}\n"Then should I choose Haruchi?"
<es>

@126
<en>{Rin}\n"Yeah you guys should get together.\nIf Sakura gains interest to guys then I don't have to get teased by you."
<es>

@127
<en>Rin is recommending me for that kind of reason?\nBut isn't Sakura up for it?
<es>

@128
<en>{Ran}\n"Isn't kind of getting weird situation?"
<es>

@129
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not getting into a weird situation.\nThe situation was totally unexpected though."
<es>

@130
<en>Sakura seems to be thinking seriously.
<es>

@131
<en>{Sakura}\n"Maybe Haruchi isn't so bad.\nHowever, I never seen Haruchi in that way so I'll need to think a little bit more."
<es>

@132
<en>{Rin}\n"Yeah yeah You two should just take your time."
<es>

@133
<en>Both of us take our time......
<es>

@134
<en>{Ran}\n"What kind of scene is this? This is boring."
<es>

@135
<en>Ran seems unsatisfied.\nShe probably doesn't like the fact that I'm feeling good.
<es>

@136
<en>{Ran}\n"What's so good about Kazushi?\nI'll change their view a little."
<es>

@137
<en>Then, Ran suddenly tries to stand up.
<es>

@138
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Hhey, stop......!"
<es>

@139
<en>If you do that we'll get caught.\nI tried to pull her back, but Ran stood up and dragged me with her.
<es>

@141
<en>{Rin}\n"Huh......?"
<es>

@142
<en>{Sakura}\n"......Harruchi?"
<es>

@143
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um......"
<es>

@144
<en>I immediately made eye contact.
<es>

@145
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um, this is......"
<es>

@146
<en>The two is so amazed that they even forgot to cover their body. My eyes roll down lower with no intention. The two surprised girls got their conscious back.
<es>

@151
<en>{Sakura & Rin}\n"Ahh-----------------!!!!"
<es>

@160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm really sorry!!"
<es>

@161
<en>I lowered my head as low as possible.\nI felt guilty.
<es>

@162
<en>{Rin}\n"It's, it's okay so raise your head"
<es>

@163
<en>{Sakura}\n"Yeah. You were probably dragged by Ran right? Ran is the bad one."
<es>

@164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If you say so......but I'm really sorry."
<es>

@165
<en>Im glad that they understood.\nNot for Sakura, but, I felt bad for offending Rin.
<es>

@168
<en>{Rin}\n"It's okay really.\nBut, it's really embarassing so could you forget everything you saw?"
<es>

@169
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of, ofcourse!"
<es>

@172
<en>{Sakura}\n"Well, let's end this matter and forget this happened."
<es>

@173
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's really helpful if you say that."
<es>

@174
<en>I'm really glad they understood.
<es>

@179
<en>{Ran}\n"Gosh, it seems like you guys are okay about it.\nAren't you guys too nice to Kazshi?"
<es>

@184
<en>{Sakura}\n"It's all your fault.\nHow much do you think Rin got hurt emotionally.\nI'm going to ask for compensations for it."
<es>

@187
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Anything but that!"
<es>
