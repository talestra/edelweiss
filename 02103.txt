<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what do you want to do from now?\nIs there somewhere you want to go?"
<es>

@10
<en>{Ran}\n"Umm, not really.\nIt's a small island so I'm already tired of this place."
<es>

@11
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I guess so."
<es>

@12
<en>It's an island where you can explore the entire place in half a day. Other than the village and the school, everything is just a verdant forest.
<es>

@13
<en>{Ran}\n"Is there anywhere you want to go, Kazushi?\nI'll be your guide for today as a special service."
<es>

@14
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, let me think......"
<es>

@15
<en>I tried to think, but I couldn't come up with anywhere off the top of my head. I don't know how Ran interpreted my silence, but she looked at me and smiled.
<es>

@18
<en>{Ran}\n"I see. Kazushi's also a man.\nIt's OK, then. Let me handle this."
<es>

@19
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What do you mean?"
<es>

@20
<en>I couldn't think of anything, so what kind of idea was she getting in her head?
<es>

@21
<en>{Ran}\n"It's OK, it's OK. Just let me handle it.\nAll you have to do is follow me."
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, if you say so..."
<es>

@24
<en>I wondered where she was taking me. Anyways, I began to follow her.
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, where are we going here?"
<es>

@33
<en>Ran brought me to one of the baths.\nIt was the women's side.
<es>

@34
<en>Of course, there wouldn't be any girls who'd come here in the middle of the afternoon.
<es>

@35
<en>So, even if I go in, it'll be OK (barely). Otherwise, I'd be too afraid to enter.
<es>

@36
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What now?\nAre you going to make me clean this place?"
<es>

@39
<en>{Ran}\n"Shh! We'll get caught if you keep talking. Be quiet."
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We'll get caught......"
<es>

@42
<en>There's nobody here. It wouldn't be good if someone came here, either.\nAnd this time, there'll be nobody else to blame as a pervert.
<es>

@44
<en>{Rin}\n"Hey, Sakura..."
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh......?"
<es>

@46
<en>Someone's coming? That's a girl... Fujisaki-san?
<es>

@49
<en>{Ran}\n"They're coming. Hide."
<es>

@52
<en>Ran shoved my head down and I ducked. I lowered my head and watched from the shadows. The pair followed immediately after.
<es>

@53
<en>It was Sakura and Fujisaki-san.
<es>

@58
<en>{Sakura}\n"It's OK, there's nobody else here this time of day.\nYou don't have to hide yourself behind a towel."
<es>

@59
<en>{Rin}\n"But it's so bright and embarrassing..."
<es>

@60
<en>{Sakura}\n"What are you saying? We're both girls. Come on, hurry, hurry."
<es>

@62
<en>It seemed like Sakura forcefully pulled Rin's towel off.
<es>

@63
<en>{Kazushi}\n"H-hey, this isn't cool.\nLet's sneak out of here while we still can."
<es>

@64
<en>{Ran}\n"What're you talking about?\nYou'd never get this kind of opportunity otherwise, so just watch."
<es>

@65
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Even though you say to just watch......"
<es>

@66
<en>There's two naked classmates in front of me and they're pretty. Of course I want to watch.
<es>

@67
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But peeping is bad."
<es>

@68
<en>{Ran}\n"Rin's breasts are nice as usual.\nDespite her face, she has a plump and sexy body, that girl."
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Re-really?"
<es>

@70
<en>I want to look.
<es>

@71
<en>But......\nI want to look.
<es>

@72
<en>Dammit, my head can only think "I want to look."
<es>

@73
<en>{Ran}\n"She always covers herself up when she goes to the bath with me, but she's showing it all today. It's so weird. She doesn't need to hide if it's just us girls."
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Isn't that because there are those who stare, just like you are now?"
<es>

@75
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmm, Sakura's pretty hot too.\nShe's got a sweet butt that I want to nibble. Damn that's nice."
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're a guy.\nYou're definitely a guy."
<es>

@77
<en>She was concentrating on their bodies more than I was. And she was licking her chops too.
<es>

@78
<en>{Ran}\n"You should be watching too, Kazushi.\nHey, look! Look!"
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What......wow......"
<es>

@80
<en>{Rin}\n"Hey, Sakura, stop..."
<es>

@81
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow......"
<es>

@82
<en>Sakura poked Rin's breast. I was able to imagine how soft they were just by watching how deeply her finger went. The thought made me dizzy.
<es>

@83
<en>{Rin}\n"Hey, don't touch me there..."
<es>

@84
<en>{Sakura}\n"Why not?\nIt's just between us girls."
<es>

@85
<en>{Rin}\n"It's wrong because it's between two girls.\nIt's weird."
<es>

@86
<en>{Sakura}\n"Is it?\nSo you'd be OK with a guy then?\nYou'll let the guys do sexy things with you?"
<es>

@87
<en>{Rin}\n"I--I'm not saying that. If it's a guy I liked then I'd probably let him..."
<es>

@88
<en>I started getting dizzy. The conversation took a turn for the explicit. If this keeps going, I won't stay sane.
<es>

@90
<en>{Sakura}\n"So, which guys in our class would you let touch you?"
<es>

@91
<en>I wanted to hear her answer on this topic.\nRan got her face in mine as a tease.
<es>

@92
<en>{Ran}\n"You sure look interested, Kazushi.\nAre you hoping she chooses you?"
<es>

@93
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's OK, isn't it? I'm curious. Maybe she'll choose me."
<es>

@94
<en>{Ran}\n"Hahaha, there's no way. You're a nice guy, Kazushi, but you seem rather unreliable."
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shut up."
<es>

@96
<en>{Rin}\n"The boys in class seem unreliable. I guess older men are just more mature."
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Damn, so that's how it is..."
<es>

@98
<en>It was exactly as Ran thought.\nShe was wearing a victorious smile.
<es>

@99
<en>{Sakura}\n"How about a boy from the senior class or a teacher?\nWhat about Yagami-sensei?"
<es>

@100
<en>{Rin}\n"He's hot, but he says he has a wife."
<es>

@101
<en>{Sakura}\n"Then a senior?"
<es>

@102
<en>{Rin}\n"I think Iida-sempai is handsome."
<es>

@103
<en>Wow, Panchu-sempai.\nRin has good taste.
<es>

@104
<en>{Sakura}\n"But I can't understand a word he says, and isn't he kinda scary?"
<es>

@105
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sakura doesn't know anything about Panchu-sempai!"
<es>

@106
<en>{Rin}\n"But, if you look closely, he has very kind eyes."
<es>

@107
<en>{Sakura}\n"Really? He's so scary that I never got close enough to look."
<es>

@108
<en>Well, OK, even I never got close enough to his face to look at his eyes.
<es>

@109
<en>Rin might be a really nice catch.
<es>

@110
<en>{Sakura}\n"How about the guys from our class? Like Harucchi?"
<es>

@111
<en>Oh, they're talking about me.
<es>

@112
<en>{Rin}\n"Haruma-kun......is a nice guy."
<es>

@113
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That makes me sound so pathetic."
<es>

@114
<en>{Ran}\n"Nice guys finish last. Too bad."
<es>

@115
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Stop being so happy about it. It's weird."
<es>

@116
<en>I want to go home.\nWhy am I even here?
<es>

@117
<en>{Rin}\n"How about you, Sakura?\nYou're on good terms with Haruma-kun."
<es>

@118
<en>{Sakura}\n"Yeah, I get along with him.\nHe's easy to talk to."
<es>

@119
<en>{Rin}\n"You guys are always joking around."
<es>

@120
<en>{Sakura}\n"'Cause I never really think of him as the opposite sex."
<es>

@121
<en>I'm not thinking about Sakura as the opposite sex, either.\nBut maybe I don't have any masculine charm? I'll have to think about that.
<es>

@122
<en>{Rin}\n"But aren't there those kinds of cases where two people are attracted to each other but don't realize it?\nYou know, like long term friends falling in love?"
<es>

@123
<en>{Sakura}\n"Ohhhh, I see."
<es>

@124
<en>You see what?
<es>

@125
<en>{Sakura}\n"Then I should hook up with Harucchi?"
<es>

@126
<en>{Rin}\n"Yeah, you two should get together.\nIf you become interested in a guy then I won't have to put up with you teasing me."
<es>

@127
<en>...That's my glowing recommendation from Fujisaki-san?\nBut isn't Sakura surprisingly up for it?
<es>

@128
<en>{Ran}\n"This is getting kinda weird."
<es>

@129
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It was weird from the start.\nThis sudden twist was totally unexpected, though."
<es>

@130
<en>Sakura seemed to be seriously thinking the matter over.
<es>

@131
<en>{Sakura}\n"Maybe Harucchi's not so bad.\nHowever, I've never seen him in a romantic way, so I'll need a bit more time to think on it."
<es>

@132
<en>{Rin}\n"Yeah, yeah. You two should just take your time and move slowly."
<es>

@133
<en>We should just take our time...
<es>

@134
<en>{Ran}\n"What kind of scene is this? This is boring."
<es>

@135
<en>Ran seemed unsatisfied.\nShe probably didn't like the fact that I was feeling good about things.
<es>

@136
<en>{Ran}\n"What's so good about Kazushi?\nI think I'll open their eyes a little."
<es>

@137
<en>Then Ran suddenly tried to stand up.
<es>

@138
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What the--!? Hey, stop!"
<es>

@139
<en>If you do that, we'll get caught!\nI tried to hold her back, but Ran leapt to her feet and dragged me over with her.
<es>

@141
<en>{Rin}\n"Huh......?"
<es>

@142
<en>{Sakura}\n"......Harucchi?"
<es>

@143
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um......"
<es>

@144
<en>I immediately made eye contact with her.
<es>

@145
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um, this is......"
<es>

@146
<en>The pair were so amazed that they even forgot to cover up their bodies. My eyes scrolled down by instinct. The two surprised girls noticed and regained consciousness.
<es>

@151
<en>{Sakura & Rin}\n"Ahh!!!!"
<es>

@160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm really sorry!!"
<es>

@161
<en>I lowered my head as much as humanly possible.\nI felt guilty.
<es>

@162
<en>{Rin}\n"It's--It's OK, so you can raise your head."
<es>

@163
<en>{Sakura}\n"Yeah. Let me guess, you were probably dragged along by Ran, right? Ran's the one to blame."
<es>

@164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thank you for saying that, and I'm really sorry!"
<es>

@165
<en>I'm glad they understood what was going on. Sakura was one matter, but I felt really sorry for scarring the innocent Fujisaki-san.
<es>

@168
<en>{Rin}\n"It's OK, really. But...\nIt's really embarrassing. Could you please forget everything you've seen and heard here?"
<es>

@169
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of-of course!"
<es>

@172
<en>{Sakura}\n"Well, let's put the matter to rest and forget this ever happened."
<es>

@173
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's really helpful that you suggested that."
<es>

@174
<en>I'm really glad they understood.
<es>

@179
<en>{Ran}\n"Gosh, it seems like you're pretty okay with it.\nAren't you guys being too nice to Kazushi?"
<es>

@184
<en>{Sakura}\n"Why? This is all your fault. Think about how much emotional damage you've caused poor Rin-chan. I demand restitution!"
<es>

@187
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Anything but that!"
<es>
