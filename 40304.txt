<en>Everyone kept crowding around Natsume-chan until dinner time.
<es>

@12
<en>{Sakura}\n"I'm Sakura! Takase Sakura! Nice to meet you!"
<es>

@13
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shut up, Umeko. I'm eating now, so be quiet."
<es>

@16
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wow. I'm still Umeko? ...Oh well."
<es>

@20
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh, my name is..."
<es>

@23
<en>{Natsume}\n"Were you able to diet, Suzu? It looks like your breasts are fatter."
<es>

@26
<en>{Rin}\n"Huh? No way?!"
<es>

@35
<en>All the guys were looking at Fujisaki-san's breasts. Having boobs like that and looking so naive made for an explosive combination.
<es>

@37
<en>*Pinch Pinch*
<es>

@41
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ouch! Ouch!"
<es>

@44
<en>Natsume-chan was pulling on my ear.
<es>

@45
<en>{Natsume}\n"Put your boobs away, Suzu. They're distracting Haruma."
<es>

@50
<en>{Rin}\n"Huh? M-me? Awawawa."
<es>

@51
<en>Fujisaki-san hid her boobs with her hands. Natsume-chan tugged on my ears again.
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ouch! That hurts! I just looked at them a little bit!"
<es>

@56
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shut up. Stop looking or I'll pluck out those evil eyeballs and serve them to the devil."
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know, but that sounds scary. Please don't make such threats."
<es>

@58
<en>Why's she so mad all of a sudden? ...Hey, I just remembered something.
<es>

@59
<en>I've got something nice that'll make her feel all better.
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I forgot. Here, I couldn't give this to you last time."
<es>

@61
<en>I held out a little box in front of her. Miya-san had wrapped it nicely.
<es>

@64
<en>{Natsume}\n"What is this? Is it for me? Can I open it?"
<es>

@65
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Go ahead."
<es>

@67
<en>*Rip Rip Rip*
<es>

@68
<en>Natsume-chan trashed Miya-san's meticulous wrapping in an instant.
<es>

@71
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@72
<en>Natsume-chan looked surprised as she removed the kitty cat patterned dinnerware set from the box.
<es>

@73
<en>{Natsume}\n"How c..."
<es>

@78
<en>{Haruka}\n"How cute!!"
<es>

@81
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wha-?!"
<es>

@82
<en>Natsume-chan glared at Haruka as she squealed.
<es>

@85
<en>{Natsume}\n"Why did you say that first, Ao?"
<es>

@88
<en>{Haruka}\n"Huh? Ao? Am I Ao?"
<es>

@92
<en>{Ran}\n"Because you're Aozora, right?"
<es>

@95
<en>{Haruka}\n"What? Can't you at least make it Haru?"
<es>

@99
<en>{Daigo}\n"Ao sounds like a horse's name, doesn't it?"
<es>

@100
<en>{Haruka}\n"What? I don't want to be a horse!!"
<es>

@105
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shut up, Ao. You stole my line. I was about to say it's cute."
<es>

@106
<en>Natsume-chan looked at the dinnerware, trying to think of some other word to describe it.
<es>

@109
<en>{Natsume}\n"C-c...cool?"
<es>

@110
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't have to start with c. So, what do you think? Do you like it?"
<es>

@113
<en>{Natsume}\n"......Mhmm."
<es>

@114
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good, I'm glad."
<es>

@115
<en>I felt relieved to finally give her the gift, and by the fact that she actually liked it.
<es>

@116
<en>I couldn't give it to her for a while, and it was my first time giving a girl a present. Well, OK, I tried forcing one on a girl in the past, and she ran away.
<es>

@117
<en>I felt like I really had saved her at last.
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah. Miya-san picked it out for you. He thought you'd like that design."
<es>

@121
<en>Natsume-chan looked surprised as I said that.
<es>

@122
<en>{Natsume}\n"Papa remembered what I like?"
<es>

@123
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure. He's your dad. I'm sure he never forgot about you."
<es>

@126
<en>{Natsume}\n"I doubt that. He's an alchemaniac."
<es>

@132
<en>{Mizuki}\n"An alchemaniac..."
<es>

@133
<en>{Ran}\n"Ptt...!"
<es>

@134
<en>It didn't sound like she was talking about her own father, and everyone was trying not to laugh about it. I wished I could have laughed out loud, too.
<es>

@135
<en>I was just overjoyed to have her back.
<es>

@140
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah, are you going to live with your dad?"
<es>

@141
<en>Unlike the rest of us, Natsume-chan now had family living on the island.
<es>

@142
<en>I'm sure she wants to live with him, to make up for lost time.
<es>

@145
<en>{Natsume}\n"But I'm going to be coming to this school starting next semester. I'm on full scholarship. V."
<es>

@146
<en>She made a peace sign with her hand. I guess the principal decided on that. Why did she do that?
<es>

@149
<en>{Natsume}\n"Isn't this a boarding school? That means I'm supposed to be living in the dorm."
<es>

@155
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm sure it doesn't matter. That's kind of weird coming from me, though."
<es>

@156
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm sure it's fine if Haruka says so. Don't you think Miya-san will miss you if you live here?"
<es>

@161
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't care about that. He didn't come to get me for a long time. I'm going to spend a night at his place tonight, but I'll be living here starting tomorrow."
<es>

@162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, you're going to Miya-san's tonight."
<es>

@163
<en>Then I'm sure Miya-san was getting ready for her to come home by now. I could easily imagine him doing that, and it made me smile.
<es>

@166
<en>{Natsume}\n"Just for tonight. I'll be back by tomorrow afternoon."
<es>

@167
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're already talking about when you'll get back? You're way too rushed."
<es>

@168
<en>Natsume-chan looked up at me.\nI'm not sure, but I think she's glaring at me.
<es>

@171
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, is it somehow inconvenient for you if I stay here?"
<es>

@172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, not at all. But it's been such a long time since you've spent time with your dad, I was thinking you should spend more time together."
<es>

@175
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@176
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why are you looking like a blowfish?"
<es>

@179
<en>{Natsume}\n"Who's a blowfish? If I'm a blowfish, then Suzu's a pig."
<es>

@184
<en>{Rin}\n"Umm... am I that fat?"
<es>

@188
<en>{Pierre}\n"Regardless of the truth, it seems like you're stuck as 'the fatty' in Natsume-chan's mind."
<es>

@189
<en>{Rin}\n"That blows..."
<es>

@193
<en>{Natsume}\n"Suzu has a big butt."
<es>

@194
<en>{Rin}\n"Hhh?!"
<es>

@195
<en>Fujisaki-san was mortified by Natsume-chan's verbal abuse.
<es>

@196
<en>{Rin}\n"I give up. I must come from the planet of the fat people. I'm going back to my own people, now..."
<es>

@200
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, Rin's losing it..."
<es>

@201
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Quit bashing Fujisaki-san. I don't know why, but you're just taking things out on her, right?"
<es>

@206
<en>{Natsume}\n"Grr... You're so boring."
<es>

@207
<en>She wolfed down her dinner in a bad mood, but she was using the chopsticks I gave her.
<es>

@210
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm going home when I finish this."
<es>

@211
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You should. I'll walk you home."
<es>

@214
<en>{Natsume}\n"... Fine. *Omnomnomnomnom.*"
<es>

@221
<en>You could hear the insects chirping as we walked.
<es>

@224
<en>{Natsume}\n"Listen to this. It's a tunnel of bugs."
<es>

@225
<en>I heard her footsteps close behind me amidst the loud chorus of bugs.
<es>

@226
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A tunnel of bugs, huh."
<es>

@227
<en>I thought it was a great expression. I felt we were surrounded by the sound of insects, and it really was like a tunnel.
<es>

@228
<en>I felt emotional, walking with her under the stars, surrounded by the sound of bugs.
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm really happy to be able to walk with you like this."
<es>

@232
<en>{Natsume}\n"You are..."
<es>

@234
<en>She mumbled, and looked down at her feet. She was already walking slower than I was, so that made her fall further behind.
<es>

@236
<en>I had gotten pretty far ahead of her, so I stopped to wait for her. I reached out my hand to Natsume-chan as she caught up with me, but she looked down.
<es>

@239
<en>{Natsume}\n"Aren't you scared of me, Haruma?"
<es>

@240
<en>She asked, looking at my hand.
<es>

@241
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why would I be scared? Why are you worried about that?"
<es>

@244
<en>{Natsume}\n"Didn't you hear about it from Papa?"
<es>

@245
<en>This must be about the stone inside of her. Could it be that Natsume-chan was scared as well?
<es>

@246
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure you'll be fine."
<es>

@247
<en>I took her hand in mine since she just kept staring at it.
<es>

@248
<en>I don't know much, but I feel like I can be a big help to her because of that.
<es>

@249
<en>That's why I should be on her side from now on. I'll blow away whatever fears she has and share my happiness with her.
<es>

@250
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry. Everything's gonna turn out fine."
<es>

@253
<en>{Natsume}\n"...... OK."
<es>

@254
<en>She faintly gripped my hand back.
<es>

@255
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You got Miya-san on your side as well. He's an alchemaniac, right? In that case, he'll be able to do something about that."
<es>

@258
<en>{Natsume}\n"You're right. That's the only thing he's good at."
<es>

@259
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? I'm here too. You'll be just fine."
<es>

@262
<en>{Natsume}\n"You're even more useless, Haruma."
<es>

@263
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That I am!"
<es>

@266
<en>{Natsume}\n"Don't be so proud of it."
<es>

@267
<en>Natsume-chan smiled. I smiled as well, so that she could keep on smiling.
<es>

@268
<en>I think that's the key for us. That's how I felt.
<es>

@275
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Here you go. Would you like some tea?"
<es>

@276
<en>He put a cup of hot tea in front of me. This was my first time being in his house like this.
<es>

@277
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thank you. But, I'll be leaving soon."
<es>

@278
<en>I just walked her home. I shouldn't be spoiling the family reunion by staying too long.
<es>

@282
<en>{Natsume}\n"Don't worry. It's the cheap stuff, but enjoy yourself anyway."
<es>

@286
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Yes, yes, stay as long as you want. I want to talk to you about something, as well."
<es>

@287
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Talk about what?"
<es>

@290
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I want to ask you and Natsume about something."
<es>

@291
<en>I noticed the change in his eyes. It seemed to be something very important.
<es>

@292
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK, so I guess I'll stay a while."
<es>

@293
<en>If that's the case, then I should stay. I'll listen as I enjoy the tea.
<es>

@298
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It was just like this island, but there wasn't anybody there?"
<es>

@299
<en>Miya-san was talking about the place where Natsume-chan was. He said the only people who knew about that place were Natsume-chan and I.
<es>

@300
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't know about that place either, Miya-san?"
<es>

@303
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I've caught glimpses. Any competent alchemist should be able to feel the existence of a world that is not our own."
<es>

@304
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@307
<en>{Amamiya}\n"But it was only for a moment. I couldn't stay long enough to truly recognize that world."
<es>

@308
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Let alone for me to become assimilated into that world like you and Natsume-chan were. Only a handful of chosen people can do that."
<es>

@309
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? But..."
<es>

@310
<en>I thought I understood, but then I got confused right away. Why was I able to find Natsume-chan in that world?
<es>

@314
<en>{Natsume}\n"You entered through your dreams."
<es>

@315
<en>Natsume-chan interrupted me. I thought she was right.
<es>

@316
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, it was a dream to me. Was it not a dream?"
<es>

@317
<en>I thought I didn't remember it because it was a dream. After all, you usually forget what you dreamed about, and only thing you remember is the fuzzy surface of the dream.
<es>

@321
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Dreams are a common entrance into the other world. Anyone pursuing our line of work has experienced it to some extent."
<es>

@322
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? But... I'm Joe Normal."
<es>

@323
<en>I'd never heard of anything like that, and I couldn't believe something like that happened all the time.
<es>

@324
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Haruma-kun, have you had any experience with magic?"
<es>

@325
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, not at all. I don't know much about alchemy, either."
<es>

@328
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I see. Then..."
<es>

@333
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma has a huge furnace inside of him."
<es>

@334
<en>Natsume-chan said something entirely incomprehensible.
<es>

@335
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Me? A furnace?"
<es>

@336
<en>Natsume-chan pointed at my stomach... Wait, I've got an alchemy furnace in my stomach?!
<es>

@339
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I see. Haruma-kun, do you have more vigor than most other people?"
<es>

@340
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Uh, don't know? But this isn't really the place to..."
<es>

@341
<en>Why would he say that in front of Natsume-chan?
<es>

@344
<en>{Natsume}\n"You're boundless, huh?"
<es>

@345
<en>I guess she didn't really care.
<es>

@346
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess I may be more active than other guys..."
<es>

@347
<en>What are we talking about? I was embarrassed, and my face was turning red.
<es>

@351
<en>{Amamiya}\n"They say 'Heroes enjoy the pleasures of the flesh'. The great men who made their mark on history were often unrivaled by others in their desires. That vitality is one kind of talent."
<es>

@353
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh, is it?"
<es>

@354
<en>It sounded like an embarrassing talent.
<es>

@358
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It is genuine talent. Some people use that vitality to pursue something similar to what alchemy does."
<es>

@359
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's like what alchemists make...? You mean gold?"
<es>

@360
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Yes. It does have gold in its name in face. The Golden Elixir."
<es>

@361
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Golden Elixir?"
<es>

@362
<en>I'd never heard of that.
<es>

@364
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Alchemy is the practice of creating chemicals to turn base metals into gold. We heat the ingredients for an extended period of time forcing them to change and create a new substance."
<es>

@366
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Some people do this within their own body. Such as the Neidan school of Chinese Alchemy taught by Taoism."
<es>

@367
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Within their own body? Wow..."
<es>

@368
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The container is the philosopher, and his embryo is his body. The ingredients to use are the natural chi in the air, and the burner is the point below his navel."
<es>

@369
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh-huh..."
<es>

@370
<en>Sorry man, I didn't get a frickin' word of that. Miya-san caught on, and smiled wryly.
<es>

@374
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Let's just keep it at that. What it means is that Haruma-kun is full of energy, and when you have more energy, your dreams become more vivid, and seem much more real, don't they?"
<es>

@376
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah. My dreams are always in really bright colors."
<es>

@377
<en>Some people say their dreams are in black and white, but I couldn't imagine that.
<es>

@378
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The more real your dreams get, the less different they are from reality, and once they cross the line, they become another reality."
<es>

@379
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, I crossed that line?"
<es>

@381
<en>I guess that's why I wandered into the world where Natsume-chan was contained: the entrance to that world was my dream. I'm still not sure, but I'll just let it rest for now.
<es>

@383
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what is that world, anyways?"
<es>

@384
<en>Well, let's say that world existed, but we aren't sure what that is.
<es>

@388
<en>{Natsume}\n"That world is made from human desires."
<es>

@389
<en>Natsume-chan was looking at the ceiling, and started to talk like she was trying to remember it.
<es>

@390
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Made from human desires?"
<es>

@391
<en>{Natsume}\n"There is no time in that world. Everything is so calm, so quiet. Maybe it's the ideal world."
<es>

@396
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The ideal world...?"
<es>

@400
<en>{Natsume}\n"A quiet place with no war. There is no time, so nothing ever dies. Whatever's in that world will live forever."
<es>

@401
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's an ideal?"
<es>

@402
<en>I couldn't agree with that, because that world sounded too lonely.
<es>

@403
<en>If it was a real utopia, I probably wouldn't have thought of taking Natsume-chan away from there.
<es>

@407
<en>{Amamiya}\n"An eternal world, huh. It is a never ending dream of mankind to overcome death."
<es>

@408
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But..."
<es>

@411
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Maybe it's the profound, elegant world where enlightened high priests and monks go."
<es>

@412
<en>Could that really be where they end up?
<es>

@413
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe those enlightened people don't feel the loneliness."
<es>

@414
<en>If not being lonely in that kind of place is required to be a better person, then maybe I don't want to be a better person.
<es>

@415
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What do you think, Natsume?"
<es>

@419
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't like that place either. It's a crooked world."
<es>

@420
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A crooked world?"
<es>

@423
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's an 'ideal' world created by the never ending desires of man. Mankind has always been quite afraid of death. Many people have sought immortality."
<es>

@424
<en>{Natsume}\n"Those thoughts, wishes, and hopes gathered together and created that world. The thoughts of people made that timeless, 'ideal' world."
<es>

@427
<en>{Natsume}\n"And it was just one of them. I think there must be other places like that elsewhere."
<es>

@428
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's not the only one?"
<es>

@432
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I've heard the best alchemists can create a small universe artificially, just like this one."
<es>

@433
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They can make entire universes?"
<es>

@434
<en>That was way over my head. I thought I was going to faint.
<es>

@438
<en>{Natsume}\n"The stone inside of me reacts to that world. That world is connected to the stone."
<es>

@439
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Connected?"
<es>

@444
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I see. Maybe that world is the power source for the alchemy on this island?"
<es>

@445
<en>Natsume-chan nodded. I had no idea, but Miya-san seemed to understand that.
<es>

@449
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I'll explain it to you."
<es>

@450
<en>Miya-san said.

<en>{Amamiya}\n"The alchemy on this island has the power to refine materials to a higher state. Take this knife, for example..."
<es>

@454
<en>Miya-san took the fruit knife he used to peel a peach a little while ago.
<es>

@455
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Let's say that we change this knife with alchemy. Then it'll cut better than a usual knife. This is because the object can make use of its properties to perfection."
<es>

@456
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can understand that, kind of."
<es>

@457
<en>If you refine a knife, then it'll cut better, and refining oil will make it burn longer.
<es>

@458
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Then, why does it happen? What do you think, Haruma-kun?"
<es>

@459
<en>He asked me like a teacher.
<es>

@460
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well... Because alchemy changes the materials? I guess?"
<es>

@461
<en>I don't know how the changes worked, and I was certain it all depended on the materials. So that's all I could say about it.
<es>

@464
<en>{Amamiya}\n"That's one way to think of it. One can also think of it this way."
<es>

@465
<en>Miya-san smiled.
<es>

@468
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The reason why this knife cuts better is because this knife was switched with a better knife right in front of you."
<es>

@469
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? It was switched?"
<es>

@470
<en>I thought I got it, but then I was confused again.
<es>

@471
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You said switched. But, what and what?"
<es>

@475
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, you're an idiot. The regular knife was replaced with the better one of course."
<es>

@476
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see. No! Where did this better knife come from?"
<es>

@477
<en>There was only one knife there, and there weren't any other knives around there to be switched with.
<es>

@482
<en>{Amamiya}\n"That's what we're telling you."
<es>

@483
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's there."
<es>

@484
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There? Oh, there?"
<es>

@485
<en>In the place where Natsume-chan was? That empty world? And the better knife was in that world and it was switched with this knife?
<es>

@488
<en>{Amamiya}\n"In other words, this island's alchemy is the task of using a catalyst to extract the ideal objects born upon that 'ideal world' where Natsume-chan was."
<es>

@491
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The stone inside of Natsume was created using that world's power. I'm sure there's still some link to it left inside."
<es>

@492
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh..."
<es>

@493
<en>I stopped thinking.
<es>

@496
<en>{Natsume}\n"Look, let's say that we successfully made something like the Philosopher's Stone with alchemy. That would be a piece of that world's power."
<es>

@497
<en>{Natsume}\n"Now let's say that's this tea. Then, for example, we sprinkle this tea onto the knife."
<es>

@498
<en>She sprinkled the tea onto the fruit knife.
<es>

@499
<en>{Natsume}\n"This makes the knife connected to that world, because this tea is a product from it. Now it creates a connection between the two worlds."
<es>

@502
<en>{Natsume}\n"That connection causes this knife's twin to be born on that world. Though it is a twin, its nature is completely different, and the knife on that world is the ideal form."
<es>

@503
<en>{Natsume}\n"When you have a good knife and a bad knife, then the good knife will remain."
<es>

@504
<en>And so the better knife remains in your hand, huh?
<es>

@505
<en>Two knives. Two worlds.
<es>

@506
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A light and a shadow..."
<es>

@507
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The idea that this world is composed of yin and yang, male and female principals existing in opposition... This is an idea shared by alchemists as well."
<es>

@508
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The union of male and female is one of the ultimate themes of alchemy."
<es>

@511
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The hermaphrodite is thought to be sacred because they have unified male and female within their own body."
<es>

@512
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's hermaphrodite mean? A guy with two swords?"
<es>

@515
<en>{Natsume}\n"What?! Miyamoto Musashi was a homo? Then was Musashi x Kojiro possible?"
<es>

@516
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who knows?"
<es>

@519
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Umm, I think you're getting off topic... No, not a man with two of them, a hermaphrodite - someone who has both male and female sex organs."
<es>

@520
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see."
<es>

@521
<en>I guess I understand. So, it's a person who has a dick and a pussy.
<es>

@522
<en>I guess they're getting a two for one deal on that?
<es>

@525
<en>{Amamiya}\n"See? I'm sure you know, but angels are sexless, right? It's the same reason behind that. By being neither sex, they are also both."
<es>

@526
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I didn't know that."
<es>

@529
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, I see."
<es>

@532
<en>{Natsume}\n"Don't expect anything from Haruma."
<es>

@533
<en>She said it as an insult, but she was right. I was getting so confused by the conversation we were having.
<es>

@534
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So the alchemy we're doing borrows its power from the world Natsume-chan was in?"
<es>

@537
<en>{Amamiya}\n"If you put it in the simplest terms possible, yes. It's the act of trying to connect this world and that world."
<es>

@540
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It only happens in a limited space, but those two worlds do connect for a second and mix. You could say it's like crossbreeding worlds."
<es>

@541
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Crossbreeding worlds?"
<es>

@542
<en>They're saying that alchemists pull mysterious stuff out of that place? I am so fucking lost right now...
<es>

@545
<en>{Natsume}\n"That's why I noticed Hisae's experiment. Any alchemy performed on this world is easily noticeable on that world."
<es>

@546
<en>{Natsume}\n"I didn't like it, so I interfered. It was all under the right conditions, anyway."
<es>

@547
<en>Is that the experiment when we were guarding the furnace for the principal? The first time Natsume-chan came over to this world?
<es>

@548
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What was that all about too? Who was that Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@549
<en>Natsume-chan was banished by the principal. The principal said Natsume-chan was neither a human being, nor a homunculus, but something like a shadow.
<es>

@552
<en>{Natsume}\n"That was just a copy of me."
<es>

@553
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A copy? Are you a ninja?"
<es>

@556
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hmm. It's kind of hard to do it in this world."
<es>

@559
<en>Then she looked over at the space next to her, and...
<es>

@562
<en>{Natsume}\n"Come out."
<es>

@563
<en>She said.
<es>

@568
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!? There are two Natsume-chan?!"
<es>

@569
<en>She really made a copy of herself! What is this?
<es>

@570
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's Natsume."
<es>

@571
<en>{Natsume'}\n"I am Natsume as well."
<es>

@576
<en>{Amamiya}\n"This is... amazing."
<es>

@577
<en>Miya-san looked surprised as well. What the hell is going on here?
<es>

@583
<en>{Natsume}\n"Man, we sure get sot in the hummer."
<es>

@586
<en>{Natsume'}\n"I know, it's so dangerous this time of year."
<es>

@589
<en>{Natsume}\n"Holy too!"
<es>

@592
<en>{Natsume'}\n"Pgyah!"
<es>

@593
<en>...... It's so surreal.
<es>

@598
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Ah-hah-hah! Funny, so funny! You're great, Natsume!"
<es>

@599
<en>Stupid parent.
<es>

@608
<en>{Natsume}\n"That was my copy. She'll do whatever I say."
<es>

@609
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't get it, but that sounds great."
<es>

@610
<en>It seemed convenient for classes and stuff.
<es>

@613
<en>{Natsume}\n"I was bored, being in that world all by myself, so I created her to play with. Until you came, Haruma."
<es>

@614
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@615
<en>I was so glad I found her, and that I was able to bring her back. It must have been so sad for her to spend her days like that.
<es>

@616
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's do a lot of fun stuff everyday now!"
<es>

@619
<en>{Natsume}\n"Huh? It's kind of fun to have a stand-up comedy contest all by myself."
<es>

@620
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We'll do more fun stuff."
<es>

@623
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah? If you want to, Haruma."
<es>

@624
<en>Yes. We should have more fun, to try and make up for her past. I have to show her more fun stuff.
<es>

@627
<en>{Natsume}\n"But I don't think Hisae will stay quiet."
<es>

@628
<en>Hisae - the principal.
<es>

@629
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you think the principal will do something to you?"
<es>

@632
<en>{Natsume}\n"Maybe."
<es>

@637
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume-chan has interrupted her experiments twice so far."
<es>

@638
<en>{Natsume}\n"The first time was when I ate the stone, and the second time was when I showed up in your experiment."
<es>

@639
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae-san was trying to create something different, but Natsume interrupted her with her copy. That's why Hisae-san wasn't able to finish what she was aiming for."
<es>

@640
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What was the principal trying to make?"
<es>

@643
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Well... I'm not sure about that."
<es>

@644
<en>Miya-san smiled and looked down. I thought he knew what it was, but he seemed like he didn't want me to ask him, so I didn't.
<es>

@645
<en>I'm not sure why, but Natsume-chan kept interfering with the principal. Was the principal going to let go of her like this?
<es>

@646
<en>And the time we went to get Natsume-chan... That seemed way too easy, thinking back. I couldn't help but wonder if she was plotting something.
<es>

@647
<en>I hope I'm just overreacting.
<es>

@650
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, look at the time."
<es>

@651
<en>The hands of the clock were pointing straight up. It's time to change the date.
<es>

@652
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I should be going."
<es>

@653
<en>I think I stayed too long. Natsume-chan pulled on my shirt as I stood up.
<es>

@656
<en>{Natsume}\n"Why don't you stay too, Haruma?"
<es>

@657
<en>She said, with a straight face.
<es>

@658
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I don't think I should."
<es>

@661
<en>{Natsume}\n"Why? Is it because you'll want to do something naughty if we sleep together?"
<es>

@665
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Pffft?!"
<es>

@666
<en>Miya-san spat out his tea. How could you say such a thing in front of your own dad, Natsume-chan?
<es>

@669
<en>{Amamiya}\n"H-Haruma-kun, are you--?"
<es>

@670
<en>{Kazushi}\n"N-no I'm not! Don't take that seriously!"
<es>

@673
<en>{Amamiya}\n"O-okay. Of course, you wouldn't do that with her father around, right?"
<es>

@674
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wouldn't do that even if you weren't around!"
<es>

@678
<en>{Natsume}\n"Then what's the problem? We're just sleeping, so it doesn't matter where you sleep."
<es>

@679
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, it's not right."
<es>

@682
<en>*Cling*
<es>

@685
<en>But Natsume-chan wouldn't let me go. She kept looking at me with a lost expression.
<es>

@686
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't know what to do with my dad when we're alone."
<es>

@687
<en>She whispered into my ears.
<es>

@688
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see."
<es>

@689
<en>Natsume-chan hadn't seen Miya-san since she was a little girl, and it's been about ten years. It might be little awkward to be alone with him.
<es>

@694
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Sure. If you don't mind, then why don't you stay, Haruma-kun?"
<es>

@695
<en>Miya-san might have caught on about how Natsume-chan was feeling, and he asked me to stay as well. Maybe Miya-san was also feeling awkward.
<es>

@698
<en>{Natsume}\n"Let's all sleep together."
<es>

@701
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I'll sleep in the middle. You and Natsume and can sleep on either side."
<es>

@704
<en>{Natsume}\n"Then Haruma'll be too far from me!"
<es>

@707
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Well, just in case, you know?"
<es>

@708
<en>They were both thinking that I was staying. But...
<es>

@709
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I can't. I didn't get permission from the dorm."
<es>

@710
<en>I really think I should go. They looked a little upset.
<es>

@713
<en>{Natsume}\n"Who cares about that!"
<es>

@716
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Don't worry about that. I'll explain to them if they ask."
<es>

@717
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But there are things you can't talk about with me around, right? I'm sure there's things you both want to talk about together."
<es>

@720
<en>{Natsume}\n"That's the thing! I'm not sure what to talk about after all these years."
<es>

@721
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry about it. He's your father, and everything will turn out fine!!"
<es>

@722
<en>{Natsume}\n"But..."
<es>

@723
<en>I'd never seen her so worried. I wished that I could stay close to her, but...
<es>

@727
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't think about anything. You just let Miya-san worry about it, and spoil yourself."
<es>

@728
<en>I'm sure we should let Miya-san handle this. They are father and daughter, after all.
<es>

@729
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right, Miya-san?"
<es>

@730
<en>Miya-san swore to be a good father, so I was certain he could handle it.
<es>

@734
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Yeah, of course."
<es>

@735
<en>Miya-san nodded firmly, and softly stroked Natsume-chan's hair.
<es>

@740
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I just want you to stay. I'll take care of the thinking part, so don't worry about anything."
<es>

@741
<en>He stroked her hair softly. Natsume-chan closed her eyes like a cat, and let Miya-san do whatever he wanted.
<es>

@744
<en>{Natsume}\n"Alright. Haruma, you're in the way, go home."
<es>

@745
<en>She changed her mind instantly.
<es>

@746
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, yeah, I'm leaving."
<es>

@749
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hey, I'm just joking."
<es>

@750
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know."
<es>

@753
<en>I smiled, and Natsume-chan's face went red as she turned away.
<es>

@754
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'll walk you out."
<es>

@758
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is far enough."
<es>

@761
<en>I told her, as I walked out through the store. She was right behind me. Natsume-chan looked unhappy, but she nodded.
<es>

@762
<en>{Natsume}\n"Uh-huh. Alright."
<es>

@763
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't be so spoiled, okay? No, maybe you should?"
<es>

@766
<en>{Natsume}\n"I will. But I'm sleepy, so I'll go to bed soon."
<es>

@767
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure that's fine, too. Sleep tight."
<es>

@768
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah, I will. You too."
<es>

@769
<en>She was stifling a yawn as we were talking. She really did seem sleepy.
<es>

@770
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I'll be going. Good night."
<es>

@772
<en>I waved at her and turned around.
<es>

@775
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hold on."
<es>

@776
<en>She grabbed onto my shirt once again as I started to walk.
<es>

@777
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@780
<en>I was attacked by something as I turned around. It was the shock of a small, soft pair of lips.
<es>

@783
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@787
<en>The lip parted ways with me in a moment. Natsume-chan was looking at me with a serious face.
<es>

@788
<en>{Natsume}\n"I thought I'd do it on your cheek, but you turned around so suddenly. Oh well."
<es>

@789
<en>You don't care? Well, I guess I don't mind, either. It made me happy.
<es>

@790
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what was that for?"
<es>

@793
<en>{Natsume}\n"A good night kiss. You kissed me when I woke up, so we have to do it when I go to sleep, right?"
<es>

@794
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that a rule?"
<es>

@797
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes. I don't want to be unable to wake up again."
<es>

@798
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@799
<en>Now it made sense. Natsume-chan woke up yesterday, and hadn't been back to sleep yet. But she was asleep for many years before that.
<es>

@800
<en>Maybe she was still scared by the thought of not being able to wake up.
<es>

@801
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry. If you can't get up, then I'll come to wake you up tomorrow."
<es>

@804
<en>{Natsume}\n"Of course. You woke me up, so you have to keep waking me up. That's why I told you to stay tonight."
<es>

@805
<en>I see. That was the reason she asked me to stay.
<es>

@806
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I promise. I'll come to wake you up with my bike."
<es>

@809
<en>{Natsume}\n"Okay."
<es>

@810
<en>But I was sure we wouldn't have to worry about that anymore.\nI think she'll wake up by herself tomorrow, and she'll know how easy it is to wake up.
<es>

@813
<en>{Natsume}\n"Then one more time."
<es>

@814
<en>She asked for another kiss. She was on her tip-toes, and I reached over to kiss her.
<es>

@816
<en>*Chatter...*
<es>

@817
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@818
<en>I heard an odd noise and looked up.
<es>

@821
<en>{Amamiya}\n"......"
<es>

@822
<en>Miya-san was looking at us from behind the windows, and he was shaking. Oh, shit. He's gonna kill me.
<es>

@827
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, I'll see you later."
<es>

@828
<en>{Natsume}\n"What? Why are you running off like that? Are you doing a 'bang and bolt'?"
<es>

@829
<en>{Amamiya}\n"......!!??"
<es>

@830
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't say that!"
<es>

@835
<en>The next day...
<es>

@840
<en>They looked like zombies when I went to collect Natsume-chan.
<es>

@841
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What happened? Did you have a fight?"
<es>

@844
<en>{Amamiya}\n"No, we just lost track of time."
<es>

@845
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You lost track of time? Doing what?"
<es>

@848
<en>{Natsume}\n"Alchemy."
<es>

@853
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't believe you two were conducting experiments all night long."
<es>

@854
<en>Miya-san asked her for it after I left and a long silence passed. It was hard for them to carry a conversation.
<es>

@855
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya-san is more of a wuss than I thought."
<es>

@858
<en>{Natsume}\n"But, it was fun."
<es>

@859
<en>It was hard to tell from her straight face, but she seemed to have enjoyed her stay.
<es>

@860
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah? How was it spending time with your dad?"
<es>

@861
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm glad I stayed alone. We did talk about a lot of things."
<es>

@862
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? Even if you're separated for a while, you're still family. It's like that as long as you're connected by blood."
<es>

@865
<en>{Natsume}\n"We're connected by blood as well, Haruma."

@866
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Us? Connected by blood?"
<es>

@867
<en>She's not about to bring out some shocking truth...like we were born to the same father or something?
<es>

@870
<en>{Natsume}\n"Because we have a blood contract. Your kiss was so bad, you cut my lip."
<es>

@871
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@872
<en>Haruka said the same thing.
<es>

@873
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But that was a dream. Does it count?"
<es>

@874
<en>It sure felt real, and it wasn't an ordinary dream, but nonetheless, it happened in a dream. It wasn't like our bodies were actually touching each other.
<es>

@877
<en>{Natsume}\n"It doesn't matter. It was a connection of two souls, and a splendid kiss. We were probably connected deeper than two who kissed in the flesh."
<es>

@878
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow. Really? It sure was sensational when I think about it."
<es>

@879
<en>It was my first kiss, so it was as sensational as I could imagine. But I was happy that it was special, even in a dream.
<es>

@882
<en>{Natsume}\n"And my blood is special, and you drank it. You took my blood into your body, so it formed a contract."
<es>

@883
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@884
<en>Natsume-chan ate that special rock thing. And they said it melted inside of her and became her blood and bones...or something.
<es>

@885
<en>So, does that mean that the stone's power entered me because I drank your blood?
<es>

@886
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you think I have special powers or something because of that?"
<es>

@889
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes."
<es>

@890
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you serious? Can I run at mach speed? Or will my grades go up?"
<es>

@891
<en>{Natsume}\n"You have the power to listen to what I'm saying with all of your attention."
<es>

@892
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's it? What a bummer."
<es>

@895
<en>{Natsume}\n"What? Why?!"
<es>

@896
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't look like you don't understand it."
<es>

@897
<en>How is it that she can't understand what I meant?
<es>

@900
<en>{Natsume}\n"Anyhow, you took in my blood, so you're like my family. You're a member of the Natsume Family now, okay?"
<es>

@901
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume Family. That sounds like fun."
<es>

@902
<en>Natsume-chan and her merry band of friends, huh? And we all live in a forest happily ever after?
<es>

@903
<en>{Natsume}\n"Or I can be adopted by your family. Whichever works."
<es>

@904
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I remember you talking about that."
<es>

@905
<en>{Natsume}\n"Is your family fun? Do you have an upstairs in your house?"
<es>

@906
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's a two story house."
<es>

@909
<en>{Natsume}\n"Good! Then I want to go visit your home. Take me to your house."
<es>

@910
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My house? I guess. I'm not going home this summer break, but I think I'll go home next winter break."
<es>

@913
<en>{Natsume}\n"Okay. Let's do that."
<es>

@914
<en>Going home with Natsume-chan... I'm sure I'll be killed in all sorts of ways. I have two brutal beasts waiting for me at home.
<es>

@917
<en>{Natsume}\n"Is your room upstairs? Let's get a cat."
<es>

@918
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's just for a school holiday. We can't get any pets."
<es>

@921
<en>{Natsume}\n"Winter break... I can't wait until then."
<es>

@922
<en>I started looking forward to winter break as I looked at her being happy about it.
<es>

@923
<en>It may've been too soon to talk about it, though, as we were still finishing up the summer break.
<es>

@924
<en>We should have all kinds of fun times before winter break. No, we have to make the fun things happen.
<es>

@931
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ah, there they are!"
<es>

@936
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey!!!"
<es>

@937
<en>Everybody was in front of the girls dorm. It seemed like they were waiting for us.
<es>

@942
<en>{Natsume}\n"What's this?"
<es>

@943
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They were waiting for you to come back. I guess they couldn't wait."
<es>

@946
<en>{Natsume}\n"It was just for one day. They're getting too excited."
<es>

@947
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess that shows how much they like you."
<es>

@950
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hmm..."
<es>

@951
<en>Natsume-chan gave the people waiting for her a curious look.
<es>

@955
<en>{Sakura}\n"Natsume-chan!! Let's go take a shower together every day from now on!"
<es>

@960
<en>{Mizuki}\n"We can practice swimming in the bath. I'll show you how."
<es>

@964
<en>{Rin}\n"I baked a cake. Do you want some?"
<es>

@965
<en>Everybody was waving at us. It was like a bunch of flowers blowing in the wind in a flowery field.
<es>

@970
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@971
<en>Natsume-chan looked at this vehement welcome and said,
<es>

@974
<en>{Natsume}\n"Beat it."
<es>

@975
<en>And that was it.
<es>

@976
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahaha, beat it, huh?"
<es>

@979
<en>{Natsume}\n"They're raising too much fuss."
<es>

@980
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, it's kind of fun. They won't let you feel lonely."
<es>

@983
<en>{Natsume}\n"Nobody could feel lonely with all this."
<es>

@987
<en>{Haruka}\n"Natsume-chan! Welcome back!!"
<es>

@988
<en>Welcome back. Such nice words.
<es>

@989
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's like you have two homes now."
<es>

@993
<en>{Natsume}\n"Uh-huh, you're right."
<es>

@994
<en>Natsume-chan was surrounded by everybody, and she said "I'm back" in a small voice.
<es>

@999
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess things are finally calming down."
<es>

@1000
<en>I had a few busy days with Natsume-chan and all, but things were coming to an end.
<es>

@1003
<en>{Pierre}\n"And summer break's ending at the same time, you know?"
<es>

@1004
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that's right. The summer went by so fast."
<es>

@1007
<en>{Pierre}\n"Are you well off enough to be so relaxed?"
<es>

@1008
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well off? What?"
<es>

@1013
<en>{Appo}\n"Here it is, the end of summer, and we're hanging here together with just us guys. Is that okay? ...would be the question."
<es>

@1017
<en>{Daigo}\n"Are our precious summer memories over now?"
<es>

@1018
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We have lots of good memories from this summer. It was full of excitement and drama."
<es>

@1021
<en>Everybody sighed as I said that.
<es>

@1024
<en>{Appo}\n"I told you Kazushi needed help. He always loses it at the end."
<es>

@1025
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean at the end?"
<es>

@1029
<en>{Daigo}\n"Come on, don't you remember Fukuhara from junior high?"
<es>

@1030
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, the class president. She was pretty cute."
<es>

@1033
<en>{Daigo}\n"She liked you, Kazushi!"
<es>

@1034
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? No way! But she dumped me when I confessed?"
<es>

@1037
<en>{Daigo}\n"You confessed in front of everybody, right? All the girls were saying it would've gone well had you done it alone with her."
<es>

@1038
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?!"
<es>

@1039
<en>I thought it would be more dramatic to tell her how I felt in front of everybody.
<es>

@1044
<en>{Appo}\n"She was the class president! So, she must've been a serious type of girl!"
<es>

@1047
<en>{Appo}\n"Girls like that hate getting attention. That's why you lost it at the end. You need to think about how the girl feels."
<es>

@1048
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't know..."
<es>

@1049
<en>I thought being dramatic would be best.
<es>

@1054
<en>{Natsume}\n"I see. Haruma has a thing for girls with glasses and braids."
<es>

@1055
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not a thing, but it looked good on her."
<es>

@1056
<en>{Kazushi}\n"... What? How did you get in here, Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@1057
<en>Natsume-chan was in our room. When did she come in?
<es>

@1062
<en>{Pierre}\n"The door's shut."
<es>

@1063
<en>The door behind us was closed. The window was open, but in front of us. I'm sure we'd have noticed if she came in through there.
<es>

@1070
<en>{Appo}\n"Where did you come in from?"
<es>

@1071
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm everywhere. I'll get you if you're being careless."
<es>

@1072
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't do that."
<es>

@1073
<en>What was she thinking?
<es>

@1078
<en>{Natsume}\n"None of that matters. I came because it's almost time for bed."
<es>

@1079
<en>She wasn't making any sense.
<es>

@1080
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You have to be in your room if it's time to go to bed."
<es>

@1083
<en>{Natsume}\n"We have something we need to do before that, don't we?"
<es>

@1084
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are we doing? Oh..."
<es>

@1085
<en>There was one thing I could think of. A good night kiss? Did she want me to do that here?
<es>

@1086
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure you'll be fine. You woke up all by yourself this morning, didn't you?"
<es>

@1089
<en>{Natsume}\n"It is very important to continue doing something like this."
<es>

@1090
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that true?"
<es>

@1095
<en>{Appo}\n"What are you hiding from us?"
<es>

@1096
<en>{Pierre}\n"Natsume-chan, you look cute today too."
<es>

@1099
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@1100
<en>Natsume-chan looked shocked for some reason.
<es>

@1106
<en>{Natsume}\n"He's hitting on me, you know?"
<es>

@1109
<en>{Pierre}\n"Don't look so shocked. I just said you look cute, that's all."
<es>

@1110
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shave the sideburns and try again."
<es>

@1113
<en>{Pierre}\n"Why??"
<es>

@1117
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, hurry up. I'm sleepy."
<es>

@1118
<en>Natsume-chan came closer to me. I felt Appo and everyone else glaring at me. I had to avoid doing it here.
<es>

@1119
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's stay up for little while! Yeah, why don't we go out for a walk?"
<es>

@1122
<en>{Natsume}\n"A walk? I'm already sleepy."
<es>

@1123
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Just for a little bit! See, the stars are so beautiful tonight."
<es>

@1126
<en>{Natsume}\n"Really? I guess I could, if you insist."
<es>

@1127
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay. Let's go. Well, we're going for a walk, guys!"
<es>

@1128
<en>I'd better do this outside.
<es>

@1132
<en>{Appo}\n"Then I'm going to sleep. Kazushi might not come back tonight."
<es>

@1133
<en>{Kazushi}\n"W-what are you talking about?"
<es>

@1137
<en>{Natsume}\n"W-was that it?"
<es>

@1138
<en>{Kazushi}\n"N-Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@1139
<en>Natsume-chan was turning unusually red. Did she understand what Appo meant by that?
<es>

@1140
<en>I guess so. She looked adorable, but she sure was a girl at her age.
<es>

@1141
<en>A girl of ripe age...
<es>

@1142
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......"
<es>

@1143
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@1149
<en>{Pierre}\n"Man, they might not come back for real."
<es>

@1150
<en>{Daigo}\n"I want to have sex too."
<es>

@1151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"S-shut it, Daigo!"
<es>

@1156
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@1157
<en>How should I handle this, as we're going for a walk alone...
<es>

@1164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......"
<es>

@1165
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@1166
<en>We hadn't talked since we left the dorm. I felt nervous because of their careless comments.
<es>

@1167
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, don't you think the stars are so beautiful tonight?"
<es>

@1168
<en>I tried to kill the silence, but it didn't work.
<es>

@1169
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well......"
<es>

@1170
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@1171
<en>Oh boy. What should I do?
<es>

@1174
<en>{Natsume}\n"You're like family, Haruma."
<es>

@1175
<en>Natsume-chan made a comment. Family. She told me that once before.
<es>

@1176
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, the Natsume Family, right?"
<es>

@1177
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah. So I'll be fine."
<es>

@1178
<en>She was nodding, like she was saying it to herself.
<es>

@1179
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What'll be fine?"
<es>

@1182
<en>{Natsume}\n"We can do it, if you want."
<es>

@1183
<en>I couldn't comprehend what she was talking about because it was so sudden.
<es>

@1184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry, come again?"
<es>

@1185
<en>Natsume-chan looked really nervous. And she was looking at the ground a few yards in front of her.
<es>

@1186
<en>It looked like she was looking at something really hard, but maybe she wasn't looking at anything at all.
<es>

@1189
<en>{Natsume}\n"I knew this day would come eventually. It's just a matter of sooner or later. And the summer is already ending."
<es>

@1190
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm, what are you talking about?"
<es>

@1191
<en>Is she talking about THAT???
<es>

@1194
<en>{Natsume}\n"Moreover, the deeper my connection to you, the deeper my connection to this world becomes. So this is also something necessary too."
<es>

@1195
<en>Natsume-chan spoke a bit seriously.
<es>

@1196
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Necessary? Is that so?"
<es>

@1197
<en>Natsume-chan nodded.
<es>

@1198
<en>{Natsume}\n"I have a strange rock inside of me, and it has unknown powers. It's balanced for now, but I don't know what'll happen in the future."
<es>

@1199
<en>{Natsume}\n"If that power gets stronger than my power, it might call me back to that world again."
<es>

@1200
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No way... Do you think you might be locked in that world forever?"
<es>

@1201
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm sitting on a balanced scale. I don't usually think about it, but sometimes I feel like I'm barely keeping the right balance to be here."
<es>

@1202
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's..."
<es>

@1203
<en>Was she saying that she was going back, even after I went through all that trouble to free her from that lonely place?\nI can't let that happen.
<es>

@1204
<en>{Natsume}\n"Everything has a place where it belongs. Is it more suitable to be here as a human, or is it better to be in that world as a part of the mystery?"
<es>

@1205
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are definitely human. I won't let you go."
<es>

@1208
<en>Natsume-chan smiled a little as I told her that. Her smile gave me courage.
<es>

@1209
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The world is so boring without you, Natsume-chan. I can't bear to live in that kind of world."
<es>

@1210
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah, me too."
<es>

@1211
<en>Natsume-chan smiled, but then she looked down.
<es>

@1212
<en>{Natsume}\n"I am not a mystery. I'm not some perfect existence. I want you to hurt me to prove that."
<es>

@1213
<en>The scratched diamond would no longer be a perfect crystal.
<es>

@1214
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, make me an ordinary girl."
<es>

@1215
<en>Natsume-chan was standing there like a lost child. She looked up and faced me right in the eyes, her gaze full of trust.
<es>

@1216
<en>Then, two contradicting instincts were born inside of me. One wanted to protect her, and the other wanted to make her mine.
<es>

@1217
<en>And there was a way to fulfill both of them at once, and Natsume-chan wanted me to do that as well.
<es>

@1218
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I understand."
<es>

@1219
<en>I nodded, and held her in my arms. I would make her mine to protect her. So that this girl could be loved in this world.
<es>
