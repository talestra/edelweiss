<es>

@13
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shut up, Umeko. I'm eating now, be quiet."
<es>

@16
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wow. I'm still Umeko? Man..."
<es>

@20
<en>{Rin}\n"My name is..."
<es>

@23
<en>{Natsume}\n"Did you quit your diet, Suzu? It seems your boobs are fatter."
<es>

@26
<en>{Rin}\n"What? Are you serious?"
<es>

@35
<en>All the guys are looking at Ms. Fujisaki's breasts. It's explosive to have a boobs like that and she looks so naive.
<es>

@37
<en>Pinching.
<es>

@41
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ouch! Ouch!"
<es>

@44
<en>Natsume is pulling on my ears.
<es>

@45
<en>{Natsume}\n"Suzu. Put that boobs away. It's making Kazushi confused."
<es>

@50
<en>{Rin}\n"What? Me? Wow."
<es>

@51
<en>Ms. Fujisaki is hiding her boobs with her hands. My ears are pulled a gain.
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ouch! That hurts! I just looked at it little bit!"
<es>

@56
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shut up. I will take your eyeballs out and serve it to the devil."
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That sounds scary. Don't say something like that."
<es>

@58
<en>Why is she mad so suddenly? Hey, I just remembered.
<es>

@59
<en>I have something nice to make her feel better.
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I forgot. Here. I couldn't give to you last time."
<es>

@61
<en>I brought out the little box in front of her. Miya has wrapped the box nicely.
<es>

@64
<en>{Natsume}\n"What is this? Is it for me? Can I open it?"
<es>

@65
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure."
<es>

@67
<en>The sound of paper ripping.
<es>

@68
<en>The nice wrapping by Miya was made into a trash in a moment by Natsume.
<es>

@71
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@72
<en>Natsume looks surprised. And she took out the dinnerware set with designs of cat on it.
<es>

@73
<en>{Natsume}\n"How c..."
<es>

@78
<en>{Haruka}\n"How cute!!"
<es>

@81
<en>{Natsume}\n"What?"
<es>

@82
<en>Natsume glared at Haruka who yelled out.
<es>

@85
<en>{Natsume}\n"Why do you say that, Ao?"
<es>

@88
<en>{Haruka}\n"What? Ao?"
<es>

@92
<en>{Ran}\n"Your last name is Aozora, so "Ao".
<es>

@95
<en>{Haruka}\n"What? Can you make it Haru at least?"
<es>

@99
<en>{Daigo}\n"Ao sounds like a horse, doesn't it?"
<es>

@100
<en>{Haruka}\n"What? A horse? No way!!"
<es>

@105
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shut up, Ao. You took my words out of me. I was about to say cute."
<es>

@106
<en>Natsume is looking at the dinnerware trying to think of some other word to describe it.
<es>

@109
<en>{Natsume}\n"C....Cool?"
<es>

@110
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't have to come up with other words. So, what do you think? Do you like it?"
<es>

@113
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm."
<es>

@114
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Phew! I'm glad."
<es>

@115
<en>I felt relieved to finally gave her the gift, and she actually liked it.
<es>

@116
<en>I couldn't give to her for a while, and it was my first time to give a gift to a girl. Well, I've tried to force it on a girl in the past and she ran away.
<es>

@117
<en>I felt that I really did save her at last.
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah. Miya has picked it out for you. Don't you like something like that, Natsume?"
<es>

@121
<en>Natsume looked surprised as I said that.
<es>

@122
<en>{Natsume}\n"Dad remembered what I like?"
<es>

@123
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure. He's your dad. I'm sure he never forgot about you."
<es>

@126
<en>{Natsume}\n"I doubt that. He is an alchemy mania."
<es>

@132
<en>{Mizuki}\n"An alchemy mania...."
<es>

@133
<en>{Ran}\n"Ha"
<es>

@134
<en>It doesn't sound like she is talking about her father. And everybody is trying not to laugh about it. I wish I could laugh out loud.
<es>

@135
<en>I'm so glad she is back now.
<es>

@140
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you going to live with your dad?"
<es>

@141
<en>Natsume now have a parent who live on the island, unlike us.
<es>

@142
<en>I'm sure she wants to live with him to make up for the past.
<es>

@145
<en>{Natsume}\n"But I'm going to be a coming to this school starting next semester. I'm a honor student!"
<es>

@146
<en>She made a peace sign with her hand. I guess the principal decided on that. Why did she do that?
<es>

@149
<en>{Natsume}\n"Isn't this a boarding school? So, I'm suppose to be living in the dorm."
<es>

@155
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm sure it doesn't matter. It's kind of weird coming from me though."
<es>

@156
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm sure it's fine if Haruka says so. Don't you think Miya will miss you if you live here?"
<es>

@161
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't care about that. He didn't come to get me for a long time. I'm going to spend a night at his place tonight, but I'll be living here starting tomorrow."
<es>

@162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, you are going to Miya's tonight."
<es>

@163
<en>Then, I'm sure Miya is getting ready for her to come home by now. I can easily imagine him doing that, and it makes me smile.
<es>

@166
<en>{Natsume}\n"Just for tonight. I'll be back by tomorrow afternoon."
<es>

@167
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are talking about when you get back already? You are too hasty."
<es>

@168
<en>Natsume looks up to me. I don't know, but I think she is glaring at me.
<es>

@171
<en>{Natsume}\n"Is there something wrong if I stay here, Kazushi?"
<es>

@172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, not at all. But, it's been a long time since you spend time with your dad, so I was thinking you spend more time with your dad."
<es>

@175
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@176
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why are you looking like a blowfish?"
<es>

@179
<en>{Natsume}\n"Who is a blowfish? If I'm a blowfish, then that makes Suzu a pig."
<es>

@184
<en>{Rin}\n"Excuse me, but am I that fat?"
<es>

@188
<en>{Pierre}\n"Despite the truth, it seems like you are fat in Natsume's mind."
<es>

@189
<en>{Rin}\n"That is so not fair."
<es>

@193
<en>{Natsume}\n"Suzu has a big butt."
<es>

@194
<en>{Rin}\n"What??"
<es>

@195
<en>Ms. Fujisaki was scared by the verbal abuse of Natsume.
<es>

@196
<en>{Rin}\n"I give up. Maybe I came from the star of fat people. I'm going back to my people now."
<es>

@200
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, Rin is losing it."
<es>

@201
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't be so bashful to Ms. Fujisaki. I don't know, but you are just taking out of her, aren't you?"
<es>

@206
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm... You are so boring."
<es>

@207
<en>She chug down on her dinner in bad mood, but she was using the chopsticks I gave her.
<es>

@210
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm going home when I finish this."
<es>

@211
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You should. I'll walk you home."
<es>

@214
<en>{Natsume}\n".... Fine. Chug, chug, chug."
<es>

@221
<en>You can hear the bugs making sound.
<es>

@224
<en>{Natsume}\n"Listen to this. It's a tunnel of bugs."
<es>

@225
<en>I heard her footsteps behind me with the chorus of bugs sounding loud.
<es>

@226
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A tunnel of bugs."
<es>

@227
<en>I thought it was a great expression. I felt we were surrounded by the sound of bugs, and it really was like a tunnel.
<es>

@228
<en>I was emotional walking with her under the stars, and surrounded by the sound of bugs.
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm really happy to be able to walk like this with you."
<es>

@232
<en>{Natsume}\n"Really..."
<es>

@234
<en>She mumbled and looked down at her feet. That makes her so behind me as she walks much slower than I do anyway.
<es>

@236
<en>I came far ahead of her, so I stopped to wait for her. I reached out my hand to Natsume as she caught up with me, but she looked down.
<es>

@239
<en>{Natsume}\n"Aren't you scared of me, Kazushi?"
<es>

@240
<en>She asked me looking at my hand.
<es>

@241
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why would I be scared? Why are you worried about that?"
<es>

@244
<en>{Natsume}\n"Didn't you talk to my dad?"
<es>

@245
<en>It must be about the rock inside of her. Could it be that Natsume is scared as well?
<es>

@246
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure you'll be fine."
<es>

@247
<en>I pulled her hand as she didn't respond.
<es>

@248
<en>I don't know much. But I feel like I can be a big help to her because of that.
<es>

@249
<en>That's why I should be on her side from now on. I will empower her to blow away whatever she's worrying about.
<es>

@250
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry. It will be fine."
<es>

@253
<en>{Natsume}\n"..... OK."
<es>

@254
<en>She answered to me quietly.
<es>

@255
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You got Miya too. He is an alchemy fanatic, right? Then he can do something about that."
<es>

@258
<en>{Natsume}\n"You are right. That's the only thing he's good at."
<es>

@259
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? I'm here too. You'll be just fine."
<es>

@262
<en>{Natsume}\n"You are even more worthless than my dad, Kazushi."
<es>

@263
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, right."
<es>

@266
<en>{Natsume}\n"Don't be proud."
<es>

@267
<en>Natsume smiled. I smiled as well. So that she can keep on smiling.
<es>

@268
<en>I think that is the key for us. That's how I felt.
<es>

@275
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Here you go. Some tea?"
<es>

@276
<en>He put the hot tea in front of me. It was my first time to be in his house like this.
<es>

@277
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thank you. But, I'll be leaving soon."
<es>

@278
<en>I just walked her home. I shouldn't be spoiling the family reunion by staying too long.
<es>

@282
<en>{Natsume}\n"Don't worry. It's not much, but enjoy yourself."
<es>

@286
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, sure. Stay as long as you want. I want to talk to you about something anyway."
<es>

@287
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What talk?"
<es>

@290
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I want to ask you and Natsume about something."
<es>

@291
<en>I noticed the change in his eyes. It seems to be something very important.
<es>

@292
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK, so I guess I'll stay for a while."
<es>

@293
<en>I thought I should stay. I should have some tea and relax a little.
<es>

@298
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It was just like this island, but nobody is there?"
<es>

@299
<en>Miya was talking about the place Natsume was at. He said only person who knows about that place is Natsume and I.
<es>

@300
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't know about that place, Miya?"
<es>

@303
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I've seen it a little. If you an alchemist, you will feel the existence of a world besides this one."
<es>

@304
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@307
<en>{Amamiya}\n"But it was just a for a second. I couldn't stay long enough to recognize where it was."
<es>

@308
<en>{Amamiya}\n"There is no way that you assimilate into the another world like Natsume. Only the chosen people can do that."
<es>

@309
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? But..."
<es>

@310
<en>I thought I understood, but then I get confused right away. Why was I able to find Natsume in that world?
<es>

@314
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi came in from my dream."
<es>

@315
<en>Natsume interrupted. I think she is right.
<es>

@316
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It was a dream for me. Wasn't it a dream?"
<es>

@317
<en>I think I didn't remember it because it was a dream. You usually forget what you dreamed about. And only thing you remember is the fuzzy surface of the dream.
<es>

@321
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Dream is a common entrance way into different world. I think people in this industry has same kind of experience."
<es>

@322
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? But, I'm an ordinary person."
<es>

@323
<en>I never had anything like that. And I can't believe something like that happens all the time.
<es>

@324
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Do you have any experience with magic?"
<es>

@325
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, not at all. I don't know much about alchemy either."
<es>

@328
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I see. Mm..."
<es>

@333
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi has a huge furnace inside of him."
<es>

@334
<en>Natsume said something not understandable.
<es>

@335
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Me? A furnace?"
<es>

@336
<en>Natsume pointed to my stomach. I have a furnace in my stomach?
<es>

@339
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I see. Do you have more energy than other people? Like in vigorous way?"
<es>

@340
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Well. I don't know. But does it matter?"
<es>

@341
<en>Why would he say that in front of Natsume?
<es>

@344
<en>{Natsume}\n"You are a man of unsurpassed energy?"
<es>

@345
<en>I guess she doesn't really care.
<es>

@346
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess I maybe more energetic than other guys..."
<es>

@347
<en>What are we talking about? I'm embarrassed. My face is turning red.
<es>

@351
<en>{Amamiya}\n"They say "Heroes enjoy the pleasures of the flesh". People who made their mark in history were most likely to be more energetic than others. To be vigorous is one of the talent."
<es>

@353
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess..."
<es>

@354
<en>It sounds like an embarrassing talent.
<es>

@358
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It is an actual talent. Some people uses that vitality to make something like the alchemists make."
<es>

@359
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Same thing as the alchemists make? You mean, the gold?"
<es>

@360
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Yes. It's called "Kintan". It actually has the letter gold on it."
<es>

@361
<en>Kintan?
<es>

@362
<en>I have never heard of that.
<es>

@364
<en>{Amamiya}\n"An alchemy is to make a portion to turn non-gold materials into gold. We take time for different materials to heat, and change its own matter into something we are looking for."
<es>

@366
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Some people do that with their own body. Like the "Ren-tan"in Chinese Buddhism."
<es>

@367
<en>{Kazushi}\n"With their own body?"
<es>

@368
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The container is the philosopher, and the egg of the philosopher is his body. And what you are suppose to put in tanden is natural chi Tanden is where the chi comes together. And tanden is the furnace."
<es>

@369
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay...."
<es>

@370
<en>I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. Miya caught that, and he smiled wryly.
<es>

@374
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Let's just keep it at that. What is mean is that Kazushi is a energetic young man, and when you have more energy, dreams become in color, and seems much more real, doesn't it?"
<es>

@376
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yes. My dream is always in color."
<es>

@377
<en>Some people say that their dream is in black and white, but I can't imagine that.
<es>

@378
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Sometimes, the dream become so close to being a real thing, you don't notice the difference. And when it exceeds, the dream becomes another real world."
<es>

@379
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, I exceeded my dream?"
<es>

@381
<en>I guess that's why I wonder into the world Natsume was in. The entrance to that world was my dream. I'm still not sure, but I'll just rest it for now.
<es>

@383
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what is that world anyways?"
<es>

@384
<en>Well, let's say that world existed, but we are not sure what that is.
<es>

@388
<en>{Natsume}\n"That world is made by human desire."
<es>

@389
<en>Natsume was looking at the ceiling and started to talk, just like she was trying to remember it.
<es>

@390
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Made by human desire?"
<es>

@391
<en>{Natsume}\n"There is no time in that world. The time is so calm. So, quiet. Maybe it is the ideal world."
<es>

@396
<en>{Amamiya}\n"An ideal world?"
<es>

@400
<en>{Natsume}\n"The quiet place with no war. There is no time, so nobody dies. Whatever in that world will live forever."
<es>

@401
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That is the ideal?"
<es>

@402
<en>I couldn't agree to that. Because that world was too lonely.
<es>

@403
<en>If it was a real ideal world, I probably didn't think of taking Natsume out of there.
<es>

@407
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The eternal world. It is a never ending dream of a mankind to overcome death."
<es>

@408
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But..."
<es>

@411
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Maybe it is the place where enlightened high priests and monks go."
<es>

@412
<en>Could that be the place they go?
<es>

@413
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe those enlightened people don't feel the loneliness."
<es>

@414
<en>If not being lonely in that kind of place is required to be better person, then maybe I don't want to be a better person.
<es>

@415
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What do you think, Natsume?"
<es>

@419
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't like that place either. That is a crooked world."
<es>

@420
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A crooked world?"
<es>

@423
<en>{Natsume}\n"The ideal world made by the never ending dream of the man kind. They must have been so scared to die. Many people longed for the eternal youth."
<es>

@424
<en>{Natsume}\n"Those thoughts, wishes and hopes gather together and created that world. The thoughts of people made the timeless ideal world."
<es>

@427
<en>{Natsume}\n"And it was one of them. I think there must be other places like that some where else."
<es>

@428
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That is not the only one?"
<es>

@432
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I heard the best alchemists can create an artificial small universe, just like we are in."
<es>

@433
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They can make a universe?"
<es>

@434
<en>That is way over my head. I think I'm fainting.
<es>

@438
<en>{Natsume}\n"The stone inside of me reacts to that world. That world is connected to the stone."
<es>

@439
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Connected?"
<es>

@444
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I see. The power source for the alchemy on this island is that world?"
<es>

@445
<en>Natsume nodded. I have no idea, but Miya seems to understand that.
<es>

@449
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I'll explain it to you."
<es>

@450
<en>Miya says.
<es>

@453
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The alchemy on this island has power to bring the material to higher stage. Like this knife..."
<es>

@454
<en>Miya took the knife he used to peel a peach little while ago.
<es>

@455
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Let's say that we change this knife with alchemy. Then it'll cut better than usual knife. Because it can express the nature of the material in perfect way."
<es>

@456
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can understand that."
<es>

@457
<en>If it is a knife, then it will cut better, and if it is an oil, it will burn longer.
<es>

@458
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Then, why does it happen? What do you think, Kazushi?"
<es>

@459
<en>He asked me like a teacher.
<es>

@460
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well... Because the alchemy changes the materials like that? I guess?"
<es>

@461
<en>I don't know what kind of change, and I'm sure it all depends on the materials. So that's all I could say about that.
<es>

@464
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You can think that way. Or, you can think like this."
<es>

@465
<en>Miya smiled.
<es>

@468
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The reason why this knife cuts better is because this knife was switched with better knife in front of you."
<es>

@469
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? It was switched?"
<es>

@470
<en>I thought I got it, but then I'm confused again.
<es>

@471
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You said switched. But, what and what?"
<es>

@475
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi, you are an idiot. Of course it the better knife and the regular knife."
<es>

@476
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see. No! Where did this better knife came from?"
<es>

@477
<en>There is only one knife here. And there are no other knife around here to be switched.
<es>

@482
<en>{Amamiya}\n"That's it."
<es>

@483
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's there."
<es>

@484
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There? Oh, there?"
<es>

@485
<en>Is the place Natsume was at? That empty world? And the better knife was in that world and it switches with this knife?
<es>

@488
<en>{Amamiya}\n"So, the alchemy on this island is to take the ideal materials from that ideal world Natsume was in."
<es>

@491
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The rock inside of Natsume is made by influence of that world. I'm sure there was some link left to it."
<es>

@492
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well...."
<es>

@493
<en>I stopped thinking.
<es>

@496
<en>{Natsume}\n"Look, let's say that we made a philosopher's stone with alchemy. The rock is a part of the ideal world."
<es>

@497
<en>{Natsume}\n"Like this tea. Let's say we sprinkle the tea on this knife."
<es>

@498
<en>She sprinkle the tea onto the knife.
<es>

@499
<en>{Natsume}\n"Then the knife is connected to that world. Because this tea is a creature of that world. We have a connection between this world and that world."
<es>

@502
<en>{Natsume}\n"Then, the twin of this knife is born in that world. It is a twin, but the nature is totally different, and it will become the ideal knife."
<es>

@503
<en>{Natsume}\n"If you have a better knife and bad knife, then the better knife will be kept."
<es>

@504
<en>So, you have a better knife in your hand.
<es>

@505
<en>Two knives. Two world.
<es>

@506
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A light and a shadow..."
<es>

@507
<en>{Amamiya}\n"We think the world is made with two opposite powers like a light and a shadow, and a man and a woman."
<es>

@508
<en>{Amamiya}\n"To combine the man and the woman is the one of the ultimate theme of alchemy."
<es>

@511
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The androgynous is thought to be sacred. Because it is expressing the combination of a man and a woman with its body."
<es>

@512
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is an androgynous? You mean bi-sexual?"
<es>

@515
<en>{Natsume}\n"What? You mean Musashi Miyamoto is a bi? So, you think Musashi fucks Kojiro is possible?"
<es>

@516
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not sure..."
<es>

@519
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You are getting away from the topic. We are talking about bi-sexual. It's androgynous. A person who has male and female sex organs."
<es>

@520
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see."
<es>

@521
<en>I guess I understand. So, it's a person who has a dick and a pussy.
<es>

@522
<en>I'm sure it's like getting more for the same price kind of thing?
<es>

@525
<en>{Amamiya}\n"See? I'm sure you know, but the angel doesn't have a sex. Because it has a meaning to it. It's not a male or a female, so it could be both."
<es>

@526
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know."
<es>

@529
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Okay."
<es>

@532
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh, you can't talk to Kazushi."
<es>

@533
<en>She said it. But I think she is right. I'm getting so confused by the conversation we had.
<es>

@534
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, the alchemy we are doing is to borrow the power of the world Natsume was in?"
<es>

@537
<en>{Amamiya}\n"If you put it in simplest way. We are trying to connect this world and that world."
<es>

@540
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It only happened in limited space, but those two world does connect for a second and mix. Like crossbreeding a world."
<es>

@541
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Crossbreeding a world?"
<es>

@542
<en>They say the alchemist gets the mysterious stuff out of that place. It sure is over my head.
<es>

@545
<en>{Natsume}\n"That is why I noticed what Hisae was doing in alchemy. Whatever they do here is easy to catch in that world."
<es>

@546
<en>{Natsume}\n"I didn't like it, so I interfered it. It was all under the right conditions anyway."
<es>

@547
<en>Is that the experiment when we were guarding the furnace for the principal? The first time Natsume came over to this world.
<es>

@548
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What was that all about? How did that happen?"
<es>

@549
<en>Natsume was vanished by the principal. The principal said Natsume was not a human being nor a homunculus, but something like a shadow.
<es>

@552
<en>{Natsume}\n"That was just a copy of me."
<es>

@553
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A copy? Are you a ninjya?"
<es>

@556
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm. It's kind of hard to do it in this world."
<es>

@559
<en>And she looks in the air, and...
<es>

@562
<en>{Natsume}\n"Come out."
<es>

@563
<en>so she says.
<es>

@568
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!? There are two Natsume?"
<es>

@569
<en>She made a copy of herself! What is this?
<es>

@570
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's Natsume."
<es>

@571
<en>{Natsume'}\n"I am Natsume as well."
<es>

@576
<en>{Amamiya}\n"This is great."
<es>

@577
<en>Miya looks surprised too. What is this?
<es>

@583
<en>{Natsume}\n"Well, hot is so summer, isn't it?"
<es>

@586
<en>{Natsume'}\n"Sure, it's getting dangerous around here."
<es>

@589
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'll hurt you!"
<es>

@592
<en>{Natsume'}\n"Oh, no!"
<es>

@593
<en>...... It's so surreal.
<es>

@598
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh my gosh. You are funny! This is great, Natsume!"
<es>

@599
<en>Stupid parent.
<es>

@608
<en>{Natsume}\n"That was my alter ego. She'll listen to whatever I say."
<es>

@609
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That sounds great."
<es>

@610
<en>It seems convenient for classes and stuff.
<es>

@613
<en>{Natsume}\n"I was board being all by myself in that world, so I made that to play with. Until you came, Kazushi."
<es>

@614
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@615
<en>I'm so glad I found her. I'm really happy to be able to bring her back. It's so sad to spend your day like that.
<es>

@616
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's do a lot of fun stuff everyday now!"
<es>

@619
<en>{Natsume}\n"Huh? It's kind of fun to have a stand-up comic contest all by myself."
<es>

@620
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We'll do more fun stuff."
<es>

@623
<en>{Natsume}\n"yeah? If you want to, Kazushi."
<es>

@624
<en>Yes. We should have more fun. To make up for her past. I have to show her more fun stuff.
<es>

@627
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm not sure if Hisae will let me go like this."
<es>

@628
<en>Hisae-- The principal.
<es>

@629
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you think the principal will do something to you?"
<es>

@632
<en>{Natsume}\n"Maybe."
<es>

@637
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume has interrupted her twice so far."
<es>

@638
<en>{Natsume}\n"The first time was the time I ate the rock, and the second time is the time I showed up in your experiment."
<es>

@639
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae was trying to make something different. But Natsume has interrupted her with her copy. Hisae was not able to make what she aimed for."
<es>

@640
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What was the principal wanted to make?"
<es>

@643
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Well... I'm not sure about that."
<es>

@644
<en>Miya smiled and looked down. I thought he knows what it is, but he seemed like he didn't want me to ask him, so I didn't.
<es>

@645
<en>I'm not sure why, but Natsume interrupted the principal. Is the principal let go of Natsume like this?
<es>

@646
<en>And the time we went to get Natsume... I think it was too easy, when I think back about it. Is she planning something?
<es>

@647
<en>I hope I'm just over reacting.
<es>

@650
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, look at the time."
<es>

@651
<en>The hands of the clock were pointing straight up. It's time to change the date.
<es>

@652
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I should be going."
<es>

@653
<en>I think I stayed too long. Natsume pulled on to my shirt as I stood up.
<es>

@656
<en>{Natsume}\n"Why don't you stay."
<es>

@657
<en>With a straight face.
<es>

@658
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I don't think I should."
<es>

@661
<en>{Natsume}\n"Why? Is it because you get horny if we sleep together?"
<es>

@665
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Wow!?"
<es>

@666
<en>Miya spit out the tea. How could you say such a thing in front of your own dad, Natsume?
<es>

@669
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Kazushi? Are you?"
<es>

@670
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No! Don't take that seriously!"
<es>

@673
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Okay. Of course you won't do that with her father around, right?"
<es>

@674
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I won't do that even if you are around!"
<es>

@678
<en>{Natsume}\n"Then, what is the problem? We are just sleeping, it doesn't matter where you sleep."
<es>

@679
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, it not right."
<es>

@682
<en>Natsume clinging
<es>

@685
<en>But Natsume will not let go of me. She looks at me looking lost.
<es>

@686
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't know what to do with my dad alone."
<es>

@687
<en>She whispered into my ears.
<es>

@688
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see."
<es>

@689
<en>Natsume have not seen Miya since she was a little girl, and it's been about ten years. It might be little awkward to be alone with him.
<es>

@694
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Sure. Why don't you stay, if you don't mind, Kazushi?"
<es>

@695
<en>Miya may caught what Natsume was feeling, he asked me to stay as well. Maybe Miya might be feeling awkward as well.
<es>

@698
<en>{Natsume}\n"let's all sleep together."
<es>

@701
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I'll sleep in the middle. Natsume and Kazushi are next to me."
<es>

@704
<en>{Natsume}\n"Then Kazushi is too far from me!"
<es>

@707
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Well, just in case, you know?"
<es>

@708
<en>They are both thinking that I'm staying. But...
<es>

@709
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I can't. I didn't get the permit from the dorm."
<es>

@710
<en>I really think I should go. They looked a little upset.
<es>

@713
<en>{Natsume}\n"Who cares!"
<es>

@716
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Don't worry about that. I'll explain to them if they ask."
<es>

@717
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, you may not able to talk whatever you want to talk about. I'm sure you have a lot on your mind."
<es>

@720
<en>{Natsume}\n"That's is the thing! I'm not sure what to talk about after all these years."
<es>

@721
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry about it. He is your father and everything will be fine!!"
<es>

@722
<en>{Natsume}\n"But...."
<es>

@723
<en>I've never seen her so worried. I wish to stay close to her, but...
<es>

@727
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't think about anything. You just let Miya worry about it and you should behave like a baby."
<es>

@728
<en>I'm sure we should Miya handle this. They are a father and a daughter after all.
<es>

@729
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right, Miya?"
<es>

@730
<en>Miya swore to be a good father, so I'm sure he can handle it.
<es>

@734
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, sure."
<es>

@735
<en>Miya nodded firmly. And he stroked Natsume softly.
<es>

@740
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I just want you to stay. I'll take care of all the thinking part, so don't worry about anything."
<es>

@741
<en>He stroked her hair softly. Natsume closed her eyes like a cat and let Miya do whatever he does.
<es>

@744
<en>{Natsume}\n"OK. Kazushi, go home."
<es>

@745
<en>She changed her mind instantly.
<es>

@746
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, OK. I'm leaving."
<es>

@749
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hey, I'm just joking."
<es>

@750
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know."
<es>

@753
<en>I smiled and Natsume turned her face red and turned away.
<es>

@754
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'll walk you out."
<es>

@758
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is good."
<es>

@761
<en>I told her as I walked out the store. She was right behind me. Natsume looked not happy but she nodded.
<es>

@762
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm. Fine."
<es>

@763
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't be so spoiled. Well, should you?"
<es>

@766
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes. But I'm kind of sleepy, so I might go to sleep right away."
<es>

@767
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure that's fine too. Sleep tight."
<es>

@768
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah. I'll go to sleep. Aren't you?"
<es>

@769
<en>She was killing a yarn as we were talking. She seems to be really sleepy.
<es>

@770
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I'll be going. Good night."
<es>

@772
<en>I wave at her and turned around.
<es>

@775
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hold on."
<es>

@776
<en>She grabbed onto my shirt once again as I started to walk.
<es>

@777
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@780
<en>I was attacked by something as I turned around. It was a shock of a small, soft lips.
<es>

@783
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@787
<en>The lip parted in a moment. Natsume was looking at me with serious face.
<es>

@788
<en>{Natsume}\n"I thought I'll do it on your cheek. But you turned around so sudden. Oh, well."
<es>

@789
<en>You don't care? Well, I guess I don't mind either. It made me happy.
<es>

@790
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what was it for?"
<es>

@793
<en>{Natsume}\n"A kiss good night. You kissed me when I woke up, so we have to do it when I go to sleep, right?"
<es>

@794
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that a rule?"
<es>

@797
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes. I don't want to not be able to wake up again."
<es>

@798
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@799
<en>I see. Natsume woke up yesterday, and haven't been sleeping yet. She was in a sleep for many years before that.
<es>

@800
<en>Maybe she is scared of the thought of not being able to wake up.
<es>

@801
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry. If you can't get up then I'll come to wake you up tomorrow."
<es>

@804
<en>{Natsume}\n"Of course. You woke me up, so you have to keep waking me up. That is why I told you to stay tonight."
<es>

@805
<en>I see. That was the reason for her to ask me to stay.
<es>

@806
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I promise. I'll come to wake you up with my bike."
<es>

@809
<en>{Natsume}\n"Okay"
<es>

@810
<en>But, I'm sure we don't have to worry about that anymore. I think she will wake up by herself tomorrow and she'll know how easy it is to wake up.
<es>

@813
<en>{Natsume}\n"One more time."
<es>

@814
<en>She asked for more kiss. She was on her tip-toes and I reached over to kiss her.
<es>

@816
<en>Noise
<es>

@817
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@818
<en>I heard some odd noise and looked up.
<es>

@821
<en>{Amamiya}\n"....."
<es>

@822
<en>Miya was looking at us from behind the windows and he was shaking. Oh, shit. He will kill me.
<es>

@827
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, I'll see you later"
<es>

@828
<en>{Natsume}\n"What? Why are you running off like that? Are you doing the "fuck and run"?"
<es>

@829
<en>{Amamiya}\n"......!?!?"
<es>

@830
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't say that!"
<es>

@835
<en>Next day
<es>

@840
<en>They looked like a zombie when I went to pick Natsume up.
<es>

@841
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What happened? Did you have a fight?"
<es>

@844
<en>{Amamiya}\n"No, we just lost time."
<es>

@845
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You lost time? In what?"
<es>

@848
<en>{Natsume}\n"An alchemy."
<es>

@853
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't believe you are doing the experiment all night long."
<es>

@854
<en>Miya has asked her for it after I left. It has hard to carry a conversation.
<es>

@855
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya is more of a wuss than I thought."
<es>

@858
<en>{Natsume}\n"But, it was fun."
<es>

@859
<en>It was hard to tell from her straight face, but it seems she enjoyed her stay.
<es>

@860
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah? How was it to spend time with your dad?"
<es>

@861
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm glad I stayed alone. We did talk about a lot of things."
<es>

@862
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? Even if you are separated for a while you still are a family. If you are connected by the blood, it's probably like that."
<es>

@865
<en>{Natsume}\n"We are linked with blood as well, Kazushi."
<es>

@866
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Us? Linked?"
<es>

@867
<en>Is it something like a step-sister kind of things?
<es>

@870
<en>{Natsume}\n"Because we have a contract of the blood. Your kiss is so bad, you cut my lip."
<es>

@871
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@872
<en>Haruka said a same thing.
<es>

@873
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But it was a dream. Could it count as a real thing?"
<es>

@874
<en>It sure felt like a real thing, and it wasn't an ordinary dream, but nonetheless, it happened in a dream. It wasn't like our bodies were actually touching each other.
<es>

@877
<en>{Natsume}\n"It doesn't matter. It was connection of a soul and a soul, with dignified act of kiss. It's probably deeper than actual kissing."
<es>

@878
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow. Really? It sure was sensational when I think about it."
<es>

@879
<en>It was my first kiss. So, it was sensational as is. But I'm happy that it is special even in a dream.
<es>

@882
<en>{Natsume}\n"And my blood is special and you drank it. You took my blood into your body, so it is a contract."
<es>

@883
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@884
<en>Natsume ate that special rock thing. And they said it melted inside of her and became her blood and the bones...or something.

<es>

@891

<es>

@892

<en>{Natsume}\n"Anyhow, you took in my blood, so you are like my family. You are a member of Natsume family, Okay?"
<es>

@901
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume family. That sounds like fun."
<es>

@902
<en>Is it kind of like a Natsume family and friends? And we all live in a forest happily ever after.
<es>

@903
<en>{Natsume}\n"Or, I can be adopted to your family. Whichever works."
<es>

@904

@913
<en>{Natsume}\n"Okay. Let's do that."
<es>

@914

<es>

@917
<en>{Natsume}\n"Is your room upstairs? Let's get a cat."
<es>

@918

@921

<es>

@922

<es>

@923
<en>It may be too soon to talk about it as we are still finishing up the summer break.
<es>

@924

<es>

@942
<en>{Natsume}\n"What is that?"
<es>

@943
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They were waiting for you to come back. I guess they couldn't wait."
<es>

@946
<en>{Natsume}\n"It was just one day. They are reacting too much."
<es>

@947

@971
<en>Natsume looked at all this and said,
<es>

@974
<en>{Natsume}\n"Too much."
<es>

@975
<en>and that was it.
<es>

@976

<es>

@979

@993
<en>{Natsume}\n"You are right."
<es>

@994
<en>Natsume was surrounded by everybody and she said "I'm back"in a small voice.
<es>

@999
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess I'm calming down finally."
<es>

@1000
<en>I had few busy days with Natsume and all, but it is coming to an end.
<es>

@1003
<en>{Pierre}\n"And the summer break is ending at the same time, you know?"
<es>

@1004
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that is right. The summer was so fast."
<es>

@1007
<en>{Pierre}\n"Why are you so relaxed?"
<es>

@1008
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Relaxed?"
<es>

@1013
<en>{Appo-}\n"He means, is it okay for us, you know? just guys hanging out at the end of the summer!"
<es>

@1017
<en>{Daigo}\n"Is the summer time memory is over now?"
<es>

@1018
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We have lots of summer time memory for this summer. We had so much going on this summer."
<es>

@1021
<en>Everybody sighed as I said that.
<es>

@1024
<en>{Appo-}\n"Somebody needs to help Kazushi. He has no idea."
<es>

@1025
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean?"
<es>

@1029
<en>{Daigo}\n"Do you remember Ms. Fukuhara? In junior high?"
<es>

@1030
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. A chairwoman of the class. She was cute."
<es>

@1033
<en>{Daigo}\n"She liked you, Kazushi!"
<es>

@1034
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? No way! I said I liked her, but she rejected me."
<es>

@1037
<en>{Daigo}\n"You said it in front of everybody, didn't you? All the girls were saying that if you did that when you were alone with her, then she wouldn't have rejected you."
<es>

@1038
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1039
<en>I thought it was more dramatic to tell her how I felt in front of everybody.
<es>

@1044
<en>{Appo-}\n"She was a chairwoman in the class? So, she must be a serious type of girl?"
<es>

@1047
<en>{Appo-}\n"The girls like that hates the attention. You have no idea. You need to think about the girls when you do something like that."
<es>

@1048
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't know..."
<es>

@1049
<en>I thought the romance was the biggest key.
<es>

@1054
<en>{Natsume}\n"I see. Kazushi likes a girls with a glasses and a braided hair."
<es>

@1055
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not that I like it, but it looked good on her."
<es>

@1056
<en>{Kazushi}\n".... What? How did you get here?"
<es>

@1057
<en>Natsume was in our room. When did she come in?
<es>

@1062
<en>{Pierre}\n"The door is closed."
<es>

@1063
<en>The door behind us is closed. The window is open, but it is in front of us. I'm sure we'll notice if she came in from there.
<es>

@1070
<en>{Appo-}\n"Where did you come in from?"
<es>

@1071
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm everywhere. I'll get you if you are being careless."
<es>

@1072
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't do that."
<es>

@1073
<en>What is she thinking?
<es>

@1078
<en>{Natsume}\n"Never mind that. It's about time to go to bed, so I came."
<es>

@1079
<en>She doesn't make sense.
<es>

@1080
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You have to be in your room if it's time to go to bed."
<es>

@1083
<en>{Natsume}\n"We have something we need to do before that."
<es>

@1084
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are we doing? Oh..."
<es>

@1085
<en>There is one thing I can think of. A kiss good night? Does she want me to do that here?
<es>

@1086
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure you'll be fine. You woke up all by yourself this morning."
<es>

@1089
<en>{Natsume}\n"It is very important to continue what you have decided on."
<es>

@1090
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that true?"
<es>

@1095
<en>{Appo-}\n"What are you hiding about?"
<es>

@1096
<en>{Pierre}\n"Natsume, you look cute today as well."
<es>

@1099
<en>{Natsume}\n"....."
<es>

@1100
<en>Natsume look shocked for some reason.
<es>

@1106
<en>{Natsume}\n"He is picking up on me."
<es>

@1109
<en>{Pierre}\n"Don't look so shocked. I just said you look cute and that is all."
<es>

@1110
<en>{Natsume}\n"You better cut off that sideburns before you do that."
<es>

@1113
<en>{Pierre}\n"Why??"
<es>

@1117
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi, hurry up. I'm sleepy."
<es>

@1118
<en>Natsume came closer to me. I feel the glare of Appo- and everybody else. I have to avoid doing that here.
<es>

@1119
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's stay up for little while! Yeah, why don't we go out for a walk?"
<es>

@1122
<en>{Natsume}\n"A walk? I'm sleepy."
<es>

@1123
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Just for a little bit! See, the stars are so beautiful tonight."
<es>

@1126
<en>{Natsume}\n"Really? I guess I could if you insist."
<es>

@1127
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay. Let's go. Well, we'll go for a walk, guys!"
<es>

@1128
<en>I better do that outside.
<es>

@1132
<en>{Appo-}\n"Then, I guess we'll be going to sleep. Kazushi might not come back tonight."
<es>

@1133
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about?"
<es>

@1137
<en>{Natsume}\n"Are you serious?"
<es>

@1138
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume!"
<es>

@1139
<en>Natsume was unusually turning red. Did she understood what Appo- meant by that?
<es>

@1140
<en>I guess so. She looks adorable, but she sure is a girl in her age.
<es>

@1141
<en>A teenager girl.
<es>

@1142
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......"
<es>

@1143

<es>

@1149

@1150
<en>{Daigo}\n"I want to have sex too."
<es>

@1151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Stop, Daigo!"
<es>

@1156
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@1157
<en>How should I handle this as we are going for a walk alone.
<es>

@1164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"....."
<es>

@1165
<en>{Natsume}\n"....."
<es>

@1166
<en>We can't talk since we left the dorm. I feel nervous because of their careless comments.
<es>

@1167
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, don't you think the stars are so beautiful tonight?"
<es>

@1168
<en>I tried to kill the silence, but it didn't work.
<es>

@1169
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well....."
<es>

@1170
<en>{Natsume}\n"......."
<es>

@1171
<en>Oh, shit. What should I do?
<es>

@1174
<en>{Natsume}\n"You are like a family, Kazushi."
<es>

@1175
<en>Natsume made a comment. A family. She told me that once before.
<es>

@1176
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, Natsume family, right?"
<es>

@1177
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes. So, I'll be fine."
<es>

@1178
<en>She is nodding like she was telling it to herself.
<es>

@1179
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is fine?"
<es>

@1182
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's okay if you want to do it."
<es>

@1183
<en>I couldn't hear what she is talking about, because it was so sudden.
<es>

@1184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry, come again?"
<es>

@1185
<en>Natsume looked really nervous. And she was looking at the ground few yards in front of her.
<es>

@1186
<en>It looked like she was looking at something really hard, but maybe she wasn't looking at anything at all.
<es>

@1189
<en>{Natsume}\n"I knew one day this will come along. It is a matter of sooner or later. And the summer is ending already."
<es>

@1190
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about?"
<es>

@1191
<en>Is she talking about the???
<es>

@1194
<en>{Natsume}\n"More I have deeper connection with you, then I should have deeper connection with this world as well. So, this is something necessary."
<es>

@1195
<en>Natsume said it seriously.
<es>

@1196
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Necessary? Is it so?"
<es>

@1197
<en>Natsume nodded.
<es>

@1198
<en>{Natsume}\n"I have a weird rock inside of me, and it has a weird power. It's balanced for now, but I don't know what will happen in the future."
<es>

@1199
<en>{Natsume}\n"If that power gets stronger than my power, maybe it'll call me back to that world again."
<es>

@1200
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No way. Do you think you may be locked in that world again?"
<es>

@1201
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm sitting on a balancing scale. I don't usually think about it, but I feel it some times. I'm barely keeping the right balance to be here."
<es>

@1202
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well...."
<es>

@1203
<en>Is she saying that she is going back after I went through a lot to get her out of that lonely place? I can't let that happen.
<es>

@1204
<en>{Natsume}\n"Everything has a right place to be. Is it more suitable to be here as a human or is it better to be in that world as a part of the mystery."
<es>

@1205
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are definitely a human. I won't let you go."
<es>

@1208
<en>Natsume smiled a little as I told her. Her smile makes me feel brave.
<es>

@1209
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The world is so boring without you, Natsume. I can't bare to live in that kind of world."
<es>

@1210
<en>{Natsume}\n"You too."
<es>

@1211
<en>Natsume smiled, but then she looked down.
<es>

@1212
<en>{Natsume}\n"I am not a mystery. I am not perfect. I want you to hurt me to prove that."
<es>

@1213
<en>The scratched ball is not a perfect ball anymore.
<es>

@1214
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi, make me an ordinary girl."
<es>

@1215
<en>Natsume was standing there like a lost child. She looked up and see me right in my eyes with trust.
<es>

@1216
<en>Then two contradicting instincts born inside of me. One wanted to protect her. And other wanted to make her mine.
<es>

@1217
<en>And there was a way to fulfill both of them at once, and Natsume wants me to do that as well.
<es>

@1218
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I understand."
<es>

@1219
<en>I nodded, and held her in my arms. I will make her mine to protect her. So that this world will love her as well.
