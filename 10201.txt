<en>{Haruka}\n"Do you want seconds, Kazushi-kun?"
<es>

@10
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure. I could eat some more."
<es>

@13
<en>{Haruka}\n"Let me go get it for you then."
<es>

@15
<en>She grabbed my bowl and went off to get me another serving of rice.
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka, would you like another cup of tea?"
<es>

@17
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sure, thanks!"
<es>

@19
<en>I poured some more tea into her half-empty glass. She came back just as I finished filling it up.
<es>

@22
<en>{Haruka}\n"Here is your refill."
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks. I filled your tea, too."
<es>

@27
<en>{Haruka}\n"Thank you!\nOh, Kazushi-kun, do you want a croquette?"
<es>

@28
<en>Having a meal can become so much more fun by just being in a relationship. Whatever I put in my mouth tastes so much better than before.
<es>

@29
<en>Whatever I see seems so much more beautiful, and even the air tastes sweeter than I remember. I feel like the whole world is celebrating our love.
<es>

@34
<en>{Pierre}\n"Am I alone in finding another stupid couple who acts way too mushy together?"
<es>

@35
<en>{Sakura}\n"No, you're not. They're getting on my nerves as well."
<es>

@36
<en>I don't know why they're so annoyed when they look at us...
<es>

@41
<en>{Haruka}\n"Why is everyone looking at us all annoyed?"
<es>

@42
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know, either."
<es>

@47
<en>{Daigo}\n"For the first time ever, I feel like stabbing Kazushi to death."
<es>

@50
<en>{Haruka}\n"How can you say something like that?\nI won't let you do that to Kazushi-kun!"
<es>

@54
<en>{Andou}\n"Relax, it's a joke. The fact that they can't take a joke is exactly what I hate about those people."
<es>

@58
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh no! Our Harunyan's become a lovey-dovey moron! Hey! Harucchi! Give us back our Harunyan!"
<es>

@59
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whose Haruka are you talking about? This one's mine."
<es>

@63
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi-kun...\nDon't say such flirtatious things in front of everyone..."
<es>

@70
<en>{Appo}\n"They're seriously ill. This is painful to watch."
<es>

@72
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Awww, leave 'em alone. Everybody's like that when they first start dating. When we first started, our tongues were entwined all the time without regard to shame or appearances."
<es>

@77
<en>{Rin}\n"So Haruka-chan and Haruma-kun are officially dating, right?"
<es>

@80
<en>{Fuusen}\n"What else does it look like?"
<es>

@83
<en>{Rin}\n"I see. How nice."
<es>

@87
<en>{Haruka}\n"You'll find your special someone soon too, Rin-chan."
<es>

@91
<en>{Pierre}\n"How about me? I'm single."
<es>

@94
<en>{Rin}\n"Umm......sorry."
<es>

@97
<en>{Pierre}\n"...................................."
<es>

@102
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But still, Haruka with Kazushi, huh? It's like Beauty and the Beast. I never thought they'd get together."
<es>

@107
<en>{Ran}\n"I feel so cheated. I made the first move towards Kazushi."
<es>

@112
<en>{Appo}\n"So, did you get to use it?"
<es>

@113
<en>Appo whispered to me.
<es>

@114
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What "it" are you talking about?"
<es>

@117
<en>{Appo}\n"The rubber I gave you!\nExcept it's not rubber, it's latex.\nThose're more expensive."
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh......"
<es>

@120
<en>I forgot about it until now. It should still be in my pocket, though.
<es>

@121
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@122
<en>I could feel it in my pocket. The box was all crushed, but it was still there.
<es>

@125
<en>{Pierre}\n"Are you serious?\nYou guys already did it?"
<es>

@126
<en>Pierre, the idiot, didn't realize where we were. A hush fell over the entire cafeteria and people were staring at me.
<es>

@127
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Keep it down, you idiot!"
<es>

@131
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi-kun?\nWhat do you mean by 'did it'?"
<es>

@132
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm, that's a little......"
<es>

@135
<en>{Haruka}\n"What is it?\nIs there something we still haven't done?\nEven after we did such a wild thing?"
<es>

@140
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? What did you guys do?"
<es>

@143
<en>{Haruka}\n"Umm......\nIt's too embarrassing to tell."
<es>

@144
<en>Haruka glanced over at me with her face beet red. She looked amazingly pretty, but I knew all of our friends would misunderstand us.
<es>

@149
<en>{Yagami}\n"Hey, you guys. I'm glad to see you two are so happy together, but you've got pretty big guts to be talking about that where I can hear you."
<es>

@150
<en>See, they misunderstood.
<es>

@151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's a misunderstanding.\nWe haven't done anything."
<es>

@152
<en>{Yagami}\n"Are you telling the truth? Going by what I just heard coming out of Haruka's mouth, that's hard to believe."
<es>

@157
<en>{Ran}\n"Why don't we inspect their belongings! If they have something weird then it's obvious."
<es>

@158
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!?"
<es>

@159
<en>It probably started off as a joke but quickly got out of hand. Ran thrust her hand down my pockets and took out the box before I knew it.
<es>

@162
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah............"
<es>

@163
<en>The whole box of condoms.
<es>

@166
<en>{Yagami}\n"Kazushi, you............"
<es>

@167
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not what you think!\nThis is a misunderstanding!\nI never used it!"
<es>

@170
<en>{Ran}\n"But it's open..."
<es>

@171
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's because......"
<es>

@176
<en>{Appo}\n"Oh, it's missing one. What, so you did use it!"
<es>

@181
<en>{Sakura}\n"Harunyan's been raped by Harucchi!"
<es>

@182
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't use it! I mean I did use it...but only to practice and make sure I could put it on correctly!"
<es>

@186
<en>{Yagami}\n"So you were planning to!"
<es>

@191
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Don't be so hard on him. It's good to see that he was smart enough to practice safe sex. Don't you agree, Yagami-sensei?"
<es>

@196
<en>{Yagami}\n"That is true... Hrmm... just don't go overboard..."
<es>

@200
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh no. My friends are becoming women one after another......"
<es>

@204
<en>{Sakura}\n"Harunyan was an eternal virgin in my eyes too..."
<es>

@205
<en>Everybody was paying attention to Haruka now. Half of the table was filled with curiosity, and the other half with envy. She seemed quite uncomfortable under their stares.
<es>

@206
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm telling you guys, it's not what you think. And I'll say this again for Haruka's honor, but we haven't done anything yet!"
<es>

@207
<en>I needed to make it clear to avoid sullying Haruka's reputation.
<es>

@212
<en>{Pierre}\n"That might be true, but no one's going to believe you anymore."
<es>

@213
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm telling the truth......"
<es>

@218
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I felt like I wouldn't make it out of there alive..."
<es>

@221
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm glad it's over now."
<es>

@222
<en>We received a summons from Yagami-sensei and Mei-sensei. Not only did they scold us, but they also took away my condoms.
<es>

@223
<en>And there we were, finally released from the inferno and alone by ourselves.
<es>

@224
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I made a huge mistake, letting Yagami-sensei find out what I had in my pockets."
<es>

@227
<en>{Haruka}\n"What's that box supposed to be used for, anyways?"
<es>

@228
<en>Haruka still doesn't have any idea why this turned out to be such a big deal. I hope she has some concept of what sex is.
<es>

@229
<en>I just hope she doesn't misunderstand and think I'm after her body once she realizes I've been carrying them on me since we first started dating.
<es>

@232
<en>{Haruka}\n"So what is it for?\nTell me!"
<es>

@233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well...those...were...uh...caramels!"
<es>

@234
<en>I lied in an instant.
<es>

@237
<en>{Haruka}\n"Huh? Those are caramels? I would've wanted one then."
<es>

@238
<en>Oh no, she believed me.
<es>

@241
<en>{Haruka}\n"But wait a minute. Why would Yagami-sensei be so mad about you carrying around a box of caramels?"
<es>

@242
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ummm...he actually loathes caramels like nothing else."
<es>

@245
<en>{Haruka}\n"He loathes caramels?"
<es>

@246
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A long time ago, his lost his silver tooth to caramels."
<es>

@249
<en>{Haruka}\n"I see. Silver tooth?"
<es>

@250
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@251
<en>I don't think this is going to work.
<es>

@252
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry, I lied."
<es>

@255
<en>{Haruka}\n"You lied? What do you mean? He doesn't hate caramels?"
<es>

@256
<en>{Kazushi}\n"He doesn't hate caramels. And there weren't any caramels inside the box."
<es>

@259
<en>{Haruka}\n"There weren't? Then what was it?"
<es>

@260
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That was... part of a bright family project, or rather a tool to ensure unfortunate children aren't born into this world... In other words, a box of condoms."
<es>

@263
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh......"
<es>

@264
<en>Haruka's face went bright red again. Despite the tension, I was relieved beyond belief that she actually knew what condoms were.
<es>

@267
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi-kun, y-you already had them ready for us?"
<es>

@268
<en>All of a sudden, the atmosphere went strange again.
<es>

@269
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Actually, Appo gave them to me. I forgot they were there until lunchtime."
<es>

@270
<en>{Haruka}\n"Appo-kun, huh? Umm, actually..."
<es>

@271
<en>Haruka took out a fancy looking condom. It wasn't in a box like usual, and didn't even resemble a condom at first glance.
<es>

@272
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka, why do you...?"
<es>

@273
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazuko-chan gave me this.\nThis is a condom as well, right?"
<es>

@274
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, Fuusen gave it to you."
<es>

@275
<en>That's Fuusen for you. I'm sure she always has one on her. She makes sure she's prepared for those things.
<es>

@276
<en>{Haruka}\n"She told me to give this to you if you didn't bring one. This is for the thing couples do when they're in love, right?"
<es>

@277
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Y-yes it is."
<es>

@278
<en>"The thing." The way she said it was going around in my head. I wonder when we'll do "the thing".
<es>

@281
<en>{Haruka}\n"Is it too early for us?"
<es>

@282
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know...I think it's OK to do it once we both agree we're ready."
<es>

@283
<en>By the way, I'm always ready.
<es>

@284
<en>{Haruka}\n"I wonder how soon a couple would do it after they started going out..."
<es>

@285
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good question. Some couples might do it as soon as they started going out."
<es>

@286
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But at the same time, some might hold on for a while, and some might do it before they even start going out proper."
<es>

@289
<en>{Haruka}\n"I see......\nHow about you? Do you want to do it soon?"
<es>

@290
<en>She glanced at me shyly. That by itself was enough to turn me on.
<es>

@291
<en>And I don't like that aspect of me.
<es>

@292
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry, I'm not forcing you to."
<es>

@294
<en>I shouldn't have looked that gift horse in the mouth. I would've been absolutely fine prostrating myself on the floor to beg her for it, but I pretended to be cool about it.
<es>

@296
<en>This is all so complicated.
<es>

@299
<en>{Haruka}\n"No, I don't mind at all...\nIt's just that I've always been on this island, so I don't know anything about it..."
<es>

@301
<en>There were no guys her age, and although they did occasionally sell weekly women's magazines, I doubt Haruka bought any. She was probably too embarrassed to buy them from the old ladies she knew so well.
<es>

@303
<en>It's natural for whoever grew up on this island to be completely ignorant about the subject in the first place.
<es>

@306
<en>{Haruka}\n"I did ask Kazuko-chan lots of questions the other day, though."
<es>

@307
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You did?"
<es>

@308
<en>I wonder what Fuusen taught Haruka......
<es>

@309
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazuko-chan was surprised at how little I was able to understand what she said. Like fella-something? Or cunnin-something?"
<es>

@310
<en>Haruka didn't even know the names of basic sex acts. It's so like her.
<es>

@313
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm so afraid I might let you down......"
<es>

@314
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You were worried about that?"
<es>

@315
<en>I never knew she was worried about such things. The fact that she was concerned she might let me down made me want to love her even more.
<es>

@316
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're silly. You didn't have to worry at all."
<es>

@319
<en>{Haruka}\n"But I heard that it's important for couples to match that way and...sex... not going well drives many couples apart."
<es>

@320
<en>Dammit, Fuusen, you didn't have to go THAT far...
<es>

@321
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry about it. I don't really know what I'm doing, either."
<es>

@322
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is my first time as well. Like you, I'm completely inexperienced."
<es>

@323
<en>{Haruka}\n"You don't? Then we're equally ignorant?"
<es>

@324
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's right. And since we're equally ignorant, we can learn about it together, a little bit at a time."
<es>

@325
<en>{Haruka}\n"We can? Is that good enough for you?"
<es>

@326
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's fine with me."
<es>

@327
<en>{Haruka}\n"I see......"
<es>

@329
<en>The conversation ended with good timing, and we stood there staring at each other.
<es>

@331
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@332
<en>{Haruka}\n".................."
<es>

@333
<en>We were staring at each other without a word.\nI don't know who took the first step, but we got closer to each other and kissed.
<es>

@335
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ahmm..."
<es>

@336
<en>My instinct told me to enjoy her sweet lips.\nThanks to all those 23 kisses from last night, we got so much better at kissing.
<es>

@337
<en>{Haruka}\n"Mmm, ah... hahh..."
<es>

@338
<en>Our tongues entwined together, and Haruka let out hot sighs. Her eyes look mesmerized.
<es>

@339
<en>{Kazushi}\n"C-can we take the next step today?"
<es>

@340
<en>My voice was shaking from being so nervous.
<es>

@341
<en>{Haruka}\n"......yes, w-we can......"
<es>

@342
<en>Haruka's voice was shaking as well.
<es>

@343
<en>{Haruka}\n"We have this, too."
<es>

@344
<en>Haruka handed me Fuusen's fancy condom.
<es>
