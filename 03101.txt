<en>I can go back and grab whatever I've left in the classroom without taking ages.

@10
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's so quiet."
<es>

@11
<en>It's so quiet that the school building even looks different from when class is in session.

<es>

@14
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@15
<en>That's why I was so surprised to hear someone shouting.
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who's that yelling?"
<es>

@17
<en>I stopped in my tracks and looked around. It hadn't come from that far away, and it didn't sound like they were alone either.

<en>{Principal}\n"Don't speak so loudly."
<es>

@19
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Eh!?"

@20
<en>I quickly figured out who that belonged to. It was the clear, deep voice of our principal.

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So it must be coming from there."
<es>

@23
<en>The voices were coming from the principal's office.

<en>{Haruka}\n"I can't help it! You're not giving me a straight answer, Grandma!"
<es>

@26
<en>It's Haruka.\nI'd never heard her yell like that.
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are they arguing about?"
<es>

@28
<en>It wasn't normal for Haruka to start shouting like that. Especially not at her grandmother, the Principal.
<es>

@29
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder what that's all about..."
<es>
