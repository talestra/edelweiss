<en>{Pierre}\n"Man, I'm starving."
<es>

@13
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's on the menu for today?"
<es>

@14
<en>I clutched my stomach and took a close look at what was on offer for lunch.
<es>

@19
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma! Haruma!"
<es>

@20
<en>Natsume-chan started calling out to me just as I'd narrowed my lunch down to either the daily combo or the butadon.
<es>

@21
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma! Over here!"
<es>

@22
<en>And there was Natsume-chan, jumping up and down in front of the cashier. I don't think she realized that everybody else was staring at her.
<es>

@23
<en>She's got something that attracted everybody's maternal instincts though.
<es>

@31
<en>{Appo}\n"She sure is attached to you. Hey, Kazushi, are you sure you haven't met her before?"
<es>

@32
<en>Appo kept asking me the same question every time we saw her.
<es>

@33
<en>I don't blame him. Even I have to wonder.
<es>

@34
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I really don't remember meeting her before."
<es>

@37
<en>{Daigo}\n"You've got a memory like a sieve. Maybe this is just another case of in one ear and out the other."
<es>

@40
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's very possible. On the other hand, such a failing will never happen for me."
<es>

@41
<en>Pierre has the uncanny ability to never forget a girl's name or face.
<es>

@47
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma! Haruma!"
<es>

@48
<en>I could tell that she was starting to get irritated. I should go and sit by her.
<es>

@49
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll be right over! Go ahead and start without me!"
<es>

@51
<en>I told the guys I had to go. I feel like I'm her butler or something.
<es>

@54
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma! Hurry up!"
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it? What's wrong?"
<es>

@58
<en>{Natsume}\n"I want spaghetti. Order it for me."
<es>

@59
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Is that why you needed me?"
<es>

@60
<en>{Natsume}\n"............"
<es>

@61
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why didn't you order it by yourself?"
<es>

@64
<en>{Natsume}\n"Just order one for me."
<es>

@65
<en>She tugged on my shirt.
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right, fine."
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"One spaghetti, please!"
<es>

@70
<en>{Cafeteria Lady}\n"Got it."
<es>

@71
<en>Done.
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There you go."
<es>

@75
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wow......"
<es>

@76
<en>She looked at me all impressed. Her eyes were sparkling.
<es>

@77
<en>{Natsume}\n"I didn't know you had it in you."
<es>

@78
<en>Apparently I managed to impress her somehow.
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't do anything special. I just ordered your spaghetti."
<es>

@82
<en>{Natsume}\n"Let's do it again."
<es>

@83
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Again?"
<es>

@86
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah, again."
<es>

@87
<en>She tugged my shirt again.
<es>

@88
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right, fine."
<es>

@89
<en>I haven't even ordered my lunch yet. I wonder what's impressed her so much about ordering lunch?
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wasn't today's special European curry?"
<es>

@93
<en>I don't even know what that is. Oh well, can't hurt to try it.
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Today's special, please."
<es>

@95
<en>{Cafeteria Lady}\n"Got it. You want that in extra large?"
<es>

@96
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I want it as big as I can get without having to pay extra."
<es>

@97
<en>{Cafeteria Lady}\n"All right."
<es>

@98
<en>An extra large is only 50 yen extra, but I'm trying to save some money.
<es>

@101
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wow, so many orders. Haruma, you're so mature."
<es>

@102
<en>She was looking at me differently now. I didn't feel so bad about it.
<es>

@105
<en>{Cafeteria Lady}\n"Here's your spaghetti. And here's the special."
<es>

@106
<en>Our meals were finished at the same time.
<es>

@107
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is for mine."
<es>

@110
<en>I paid for my lunch. Natsume-chan just watched as I got my change.
<es>

@111
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?\nYou need to pay too, Natsume-chan."
<es>

@112
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't have any money."
<es>

@113
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!? You don't have any money?"
<es>

@114
<en>Well that just wiped the normally large and friendly smile from the cashier's face.
<es>

@115
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you going to do?"
<es>

@116
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'll be fine. Haruma's an adult."
<es>

@117
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I knew it."
<es>

@118
<en>I had a feeling that she didn't have any money, so I'm not too surprised.
<es>

@120
<en>{Cafeteria Lady}\n"So who's paying for the spaghetti?"
<es>

@121
<en>She couldn't stay silent any longer.
<es>

@122
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Here you go."
<es>

@123
<en>I didn't have a choice.\nThere goes my money.
<es>

@126
<en>{Natsume}\n"Thanks, Haruma!"
<es>

@127
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@128
<en>Well that was a pleasant surprise. I didn't expect her to thank me.
<es>

@131
<en>{Natsume}\n"Aren't we going to eat?"
<es>

@132
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course we are. Let's tuck in before it gets cold. Come on."
<es>

@133
<en>{Natsume}\n"Let's go."
<es>

@144
<en>{Pierre}\n"Natsume-chan is so cute.\nShe looks like a pretty doll."
<es>

@145
<en>{Daigo}\n"She's made everybody at this table happy just by sitting here."
<es>

@146
<en>My friends surrounded her instantly.
<es>

@147
<en>{Natsume}\n".................."
<es>

@148
<en>Natsume-chan seemed to be a bit annoyed, but everyone wanted to interact with her.
<es>

@152
<en>{Appo}\n"So, Natsume-chan, who's your type?"
<es>

@153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't try and seduce her already."
<es>

@158
<en>{Natsume}\n"I hate boys."
<es>

@159
<en>Her reply was curt and ice cold as she wrapped the spaghetti around her fork.
<es>

@164
<en>{Pierre}\n"Huh?\nYou hate boys?"
<es>

@167
<en>{Natsume}\n"That's right. So you guys go away."
<es>

@168
<en>She made "shoo"-ing motions with her hands, as if dealing with a herd of cats.
<es>

@171
<en>{Pierre}\n"Ahaha. It actually feels great for her to abuse us! Do it some more!"
<es>

@174
<en>{Natsume}\n"...you a pervert?"
<es>

@175
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, he is. Stay away from him."
<es>

@178
<en>{Natsume}\n"I see. Haruma, you should be more careful when choosing your friends."
<es>

@181
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, could you toss this water on my head while you shout 'You trash!'?"
<es>

@182
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...I see what you mean. From now on, I'll make sure that I'm more careful when making new friends."
<es>

@183
<en>{Natsume}\n"You definitely should."
<es>

@190
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hey, Natsume-chan! Over here!!"
<es>

@191
<en>Sakura waved at us, breaking the stagnant air. Fujisaki-san was with her too.
<es>

@198
<en>{Sakura}\n"Do you know my name yet?"
<es>

@201
<en>{Rin}\n"Ooh, how about me?"
<es>

@202
<en>{Natsume}\n"...Umeko and Suzu?"
<es>

@203
<en>Natsume-chan took a few quick looks at their faces and spit out some random names.
<es>

@206
<en>{Rin}\n"Ahaha, so close."
<es>

@209
<en>{Sakura}\n"By the way, my name's Sakura, not Umeko."
<es>

@212
<en>{Natsume}\n"...huh."
<es>

@213
<en>She seemed entirely disinterested.
<es>

@216
<en>{Rin}\n"What are you eating?"
<es>

@217
<en>Fujisaki-san tried to lighten the mood.
<es>

@220
<en>{Natsume}\n"Can't you see? Are those eyes in your head made out of glass?"
<es>

@223
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh, umm, I'm sorry......"
<es>

@226
<en>{Sakura}\n"Ahaha, Natsume-chan, you're so cute. Can we eat with you?"
<es>

@229
<en>{Natsume}\n"You guys are like flies. Shoo, shoo."
<es>

@230
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh my god, you're adorable! That's settled, we're having our lunch with you."
<es>

@234
<en>Sakura seemed oblivious to how nastily Natsume-chan was treating them. Fujisaki-san sat down next to Sakura.
<es>

@237
<en>{Natsume}\n"How come these girls don't mind me being so rude to them?"
<es>

@238
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know either."
<es>

@240
<en>I wasn't going to tell her that it's because her attacks are weak. Everything she says just comes out cute.
<es>

@247
<en>{Rin}\n"Since Natsume-chan's having spaghetti, I think I'll have the same."
<es>

@248
<en>{Natsume}\n"This is kinda oily, you know. I don't mind, but what about you, Suzu? You look like you already have a little extra meat on you."
<es>

@251
<en>{Rin}\n"...what? I-I look like have extra m-meat on me?!"
<es>

@252
<en>{Natsume}\n"You do."
<es>

@253
<en>Natsume's reply was immediate. The colour drained from Fujisaki-san's face as it hit the table.
<es>

@254
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh no... I think my precious summer is over..."
<es>

@255
<en>According to Fujisaki-san, her summer was finished before it had even begun.
<es>

@258
<en>{Sakura}\n"Rin, you may be a little squishy, but that's just perfect!"
<es>

@261
<en>{Rin}\n"Not for me..."
<es>

@262
<en>{Natsume}\n"Stay strong. Good things will happen."
<es>

@269
<en>{Appo}\n"That's so true, Natsume-chan!"
<es>

@270
<en>{Pierre}\n"Too little too late. I don't think she'll be able to get over it."
<es>

@273
<en>{Rin}\n"I wish a meteor would hit and take back everything."
<es>

@274
<en>Her mind had already entered self-destruction mode.
<es>

@282
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hey Natsume-chan!"
<es>

@283
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Why is this table so popular?"
<es>

@284
<en>And here come more people. It's really getting crowded over here.
<es>

@285
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Everybody wants to talk to Natsume-chan."
<es>

@290
<en>{Natsume}\n*OMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM*
<es>

@291
<en>Natsume-chan seemed oblivious to the fact that she's the reason why our table's so crowded.
<es>

@294
<en>{Natsume}\n"Blech. Haruma, eat my bell peppers for me."
<es>

@295
<en>She put all of her bell peppers to the side of her plate.
<es>

@296
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Those are good for you. You need to eat them."
<es>

@299
<en>{Natsume}\n"Boo. Boo."
<es>

@300
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you a cow?"
<es>

@301
<en>This conversation reminded me of how it was with my sister......
<es>

@306
<en>{Pierre}\n"Don't be so strict with her, Kazushi. Everybody has foods they like and hate, and if you won't help her..."
<es>

@307
<en>*NOM*
<es>

@310
<en>{Natsume}\n"ACK!"
<es>

@311
<en>Pierre gobbled down Natsume-chan's bell peppers in a second and a half.
<es>

@314
<en>{Pierre}\n"Mmmmm, yummy. I can taste you on them. They smell like hay dried in the winds of Southern France."
<es>

@321
<en>{Rin}\n"Umm..."
<es>

@324
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Let me just start by saying that was creepy."
<es>

@331
<en>{Pierre}\n"Huh? You're backing away? Did I do something wrong?"
<es>

@332
<en>{Daigo}\n"Everything you said was wrong."
<es>

@337
<en>{Natsume}\n"Why are you eating my food, Thomas?"
<es>

@342
<en>{Pierre}\n"Huh? Thomas?"
<es>

@343
<en>{Natsume}\n"I wanted Haruma to eat it for me."
<es>

@344
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does it matter? You just wanted to get rid of them, right?"
<es>

@347
<en>{Natsume}\n"..................fine!"
<es>

@348
<en>She didn't sound fine at all. I wonder why she was focused on having me eat them so much?
<es>

@355
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hey, Kazushi-kun, are you sure you and Natsume-chan don't already know each other?"
<es>

@356
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I know.\nYou guys don't look like you haven't met before."
<es>

@357
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I've been telling everybody the same thing. We just met the other day."
<es>

@360
<en>But then how did Natsume-chan know my name?
<es>

@363
<en>{Mei}\n"This table sure is busy."
<es>

@364
<en>Now Mei-sensei was joining us as well. Natsume-chan was becoming super popular.
<es>

@370
<en>{Sakura}\n"Let me ask you a question, Natsume-chan. What is this teacher's name?"
<es>

@371
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yagi-sensei."
<es>

@372
<en>She replied instantly and incorrectly.
<es>

@377
<en>{Mei}\n"What? Why "Yagi"?"
<es>

@382
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh, I get it! Because your first name sounds like a goat's bleat!"
<es>

@385
<en>{Mei}\n"I see...you're good at this..."
<es>

@386
<en>Mei-sensei was feeling a sense of rivalry, but I think Natsume-chan simply messed up again.
<es>
