msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 01605:72
msgid "As I walked around without any direction, I found myself further away from familiar sights. I never knew this school was so huge."

#: 01605:73
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Shit......I'm definitely late now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:74
msgid "At this point, I think I'm better off not going back at all. If I went back now, I'd become blood on the walls in front of everyone."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:75
msgid "He'd probably make me cry. Right in front of the whole class."

#: 01605:76
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"...............Guess I'll ditch.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:77
msgid "Now that I'm skipping, it's suddenly fun. Might as well take this chance and explore the school. If I can get lost, there must be plenty of places I don't know yet."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm pretty quick at changing mindsets. This is Harumaism.\""

#: 01605:86
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"This is a really nice library.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:87
msgid "It was filled with books, but I guess that's natural for a library."

#: 01605:88
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I wonder if they've got manga...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:89
msgid "If not, maybe they've at least got some magazines. I'll just kill some time before heading back."

#: 01605:90
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I wonder if I'll ever find my way back, though...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:91
msgid "Well, no use worrying about it. Maybe someone will come here once class is over."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:92
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Now, where's the manga? Or better yet, porno books...\""

msgstr ""

#: 01605:100
msgid "My voice echoed through the empty library, surprising even me."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:101
msgid "I turned around to find Mei-sensei looking tensed up as well."

msgid ""

#: 01605:107
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You surprised me! Don't be so loud. I thought my heart stopped for a second.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:108
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Are you okay? Is your heart still beating?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:111
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Yes, I think so. Do you want to feel?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:112
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"......what!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:115
msgid "My eyes went straight to her chest. I could tell her breasts were big from the bulge in her clothes which moved up and down with each breath of hers."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:116
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Can I really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:120
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh, no, you thought I was serious? I only meant it as a crass joke.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:121
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What?! You were joking?! Y-you were toying with the pure feelings of a young man?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:124
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh, don't say such weird things. It's odder to take that seriously. I guess you don't get jokes very well.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:127
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I'm so disMEIed.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:128

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"..................\""

#: 01605:131
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh dear. You really don't get jokes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:132
msgid "Sensei's bad pun cooled down my anger in an instant. Her Mei-jokes are fearsome..."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:133
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hahh, whatever.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:136
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What's with that attitude? You'll hurt my feelings...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:137
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"By the way, what are you doing here? I was surprised when you called me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:140
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"That's what I want to know. I'm the bibliothecary, so it's only natural for me to be here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:141
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Bibliothecary?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:142
msgid "What's a bibliothecary? I'm embarrassed to ask..."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:145
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Haruma-kun, why are you here? Aren't you supposed to be in class right now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:146
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I should be.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:147
msgid "Now that I think about it, it wasn't such good timing to see her here. I was caught ditching by a teacher."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:150
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Could you be cutting class? I must say, I don't approve.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:151
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"There's not much I can say against that, but I do have a reason.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:154
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Then I'll listen to it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:155
msgid "I told her all about how I got lost. It was pretty embarrassing for a guy my age."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:156
msgid "But I dealt with the shame and told her the truth."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:159
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh my, you got lost? That is a problem. Tee-hee...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:160
msgid "See? I knew she'd laugh at me. It was embarrassing, but it was better than being yelled at, and it didn't sound mean either."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:161
msgid "She looked even younger than usual with her hand covering her mouth as she laughed. I didn't know she laughed like that."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:164
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Well, I don't blame you. You're still new here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:165
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"How could I get lost just going to and from the boys' room?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:166
msgid "That's what I'd like to know."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:169
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You know, at this school, time and space sometimes get jumbled up. Sometimes even those who are used to it get lost.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:170
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What? Time and space get mixed up?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:171
msgid "I was about to sigh, when my mouth fell open. I didn't understand a word of what she was saying."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:174
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Well, we practice alchemy here, right? I think that's the reason why strange things occasionally occur.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:175
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see... is that how it is?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:177
msgid "That's true. There have been a lot of strange things since we got here. Grass and branches are growing all around us. A living signpost and streetlight..."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:178
msgid "We were already getting used to it, but alchemy itself is pretty strange."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:181
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's still not good to cut class, though. Here, let me lead you back.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:182
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Please wait a minute.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:183
msgid "I begged her to stop."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:184
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What is it? This period has already started.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:185
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Can I stay here until this hour's over?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:188
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You're asking me to let you off for ditching class? In case you've forgotten, I'm also a teacher, you know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:189
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm sorry... It's just that this period is Yagami-sensei's class. If I went back now, well...you know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:192
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh, it's Yagami-sensei's?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:193
msgid "I'm glad she understood what I meant by bringing up his name. Her gentle expression became quite stern, though."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:194
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"He'd knock you about for this, wouldn't he?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:195
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I think so. Though it might only be a punch.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:196
msgid "His punches hurt so much, though."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:199
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"All right. You can stay here until end of this period.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:200
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:203
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I can't make you go back to the classroom knowing that you'll get physically punished.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:204
msgid "Sensei clenched her fist and glared off into space. She really must not get along with Yagami-sensei's ideas."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:205
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's not as barbarous as you think, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:208
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"But, he's going to punch you, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:209
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yes, but...... It's not like he's going to punch me for no reason.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:212
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Of course not. That would be plain assault, not punishment.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:213
msgid "Mei-sensei was absolutely opposed to corporal punishment. No wonder she didn't agree with Yagami-sensei."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:214
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Has he always been like this? What was it like at your previous school? Didn't the other teachers say anything to him?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:215
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Actually, most of the teachers at our last school were like him.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:218
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Are you serious?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:221
msgid "She raised her eyebrows as if it was preposterous. Sensei was still beautiful when she was angry, but..."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:222
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You don't believe in corporal punishment, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:223
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Of course not. The idea that you can hit someone and make them listen is just barbaric!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:224
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Maybe...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:225
msgid "I couldn't quite agree though, for some reason."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:228
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It seems like you think it's right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:229
msgid "Her expression softened as she looked me, and oddly enough, I felt like I could talk to her honestly."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:230
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"There's a significant difference between taking a few blows as a punishment and random violence.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:233
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Aren't they the same?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:234
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"We've never felt like victims. We actually feel like we're being treated fairly...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:235
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"By getting punched?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:236
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"We let him punch us because we know we've done something wrong. If we didn't think we were wrong, we wouldn't just sit there quietly and let him do that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:237
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"And at times like that, he listens to what he have to say about it. Though we're usually still in the wrong anyways...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:240
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Still......violence is a crime.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:241
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You know, when he punches us, it's not where he hits us that hurts:\n"
"It's our hearts...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:244
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"But......\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:245
msgid "She couldn't believe what she was hearing as I protected Yagami-sensei."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:246
msgid "I'm glad she was listening to me seriously."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:247
msgid "In a way, this makes Mei-sensei and Yagami-sensei very similar."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:250
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I understand.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:251
msgid "She finally opened her mouth after thinking a while, looking much more relieved."
msgstr ""

#: 01605:252
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You understand how we feel?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:255
msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You don't?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:259
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"That's why I'm going to try getting punched by Yagami-sensei.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:260
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What are you talking about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:261
msgid "Where did that come from? What does she mean, she's going to get punched by Yagami-sensei?"
msgstr ""

#: 01605:264
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"As your teacher, I want to experience what you guys are going through in order to understand what it really feels like.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:265
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I don't think you have to go that far...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01605:268

#: 01605:281
msgid "Come on, are you serious? Even Yagami-sensei is dumbfounded."

msgid ""
"{Yagami}\n"
"\"You bring our lazy Kazushi back, and now you're saying such crazy things?\""

msgstr ""

#: 01605:296
msgid "She looked at Yagami-sensei earnestly, and closed her eyes to let him know she was ready. He just heaved a troubled sigh."
