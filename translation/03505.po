msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I hope there's still some food left for me...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:8

msgid "It was almost 2PM. I know it's summer break, but I really slept late."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:9

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I slept for over ten hours... No wonder I'm so hungry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:10

msgid "I'd starve to death if I didn't get to eat anything until dinner. Unfortunately, I didn't see anybody at the counter."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:11

msgid "None of the old cafeteria ladies who usually ladled out our lunch with a smile were there."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:12

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hello.\nIs anyone working!!?\nI'm starving!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:13

msgid "I made a pitiful voice, hoping somebody would hear me in the kitchen."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:14

msgid "{Cafeteria Lady}\n\"Oh, hi.\nYou missed your lunch?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:15

msgid "The old lady had changed out of her apron and into her casual clothes, but that didn't stop me from begging her."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:16

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I didn't eat anything this morning. I'm dying!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:17

msgid "{Cafeteria Lady}\n\"You must be.\nYou should've woken up earlier.\nIt's your own fault.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:18

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I wasn't sleeping!\nI was doing Mei-sensei a favour and cleaning up the library!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:19

msgid "{Mei}\n\"I don't recall asking that favor of you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:20

msgid "Shit!"
msgstr ""

#: 03505:21

msgid "I snapped my head around while freaking out."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:26

msgid "There was Mei-sensei, head of the library, enjoying her meal."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:27

msgid "{Mei}\n\"You even had to skip your lunch to help me out. I feel so terrible.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:28

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"N-no... don't. I'm perfectly fine.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:31

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Don't say that. Haruma-kun, you look hungry, so let me treat you to lunch.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:32

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No! You don't have to do it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:33

msgid "I was sleeping in! If I let her buy me lunch, who knows what the repercussions will be?"
msgstr ""

#: 03505:36

msgid "{Mei}\n\"I think you should let me buy your lunch. After all, the result's going to be the same.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:37

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"It is?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:38

msgid "Whether I reject her offer or not, it looks like I'll be spending the afternoon doing chores for her."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:39

msgid "{Mei}\n\"What do you say?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:40

msgid "She never dropped her smile, which didn't exactly make me happy at the moment."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:41

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"......thank you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:42

msgid "I should at least eat and get some energy for whatever she's going to make me do."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:45

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Let's get it on!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:48

msgid "{Mei}\n\"You're so energetic! It seems like it was worth treating you to lunch.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:49

msgid "I had fresh energy from lunch, but I also calmed down and realized something important: we cleaned the library right before the start of summer break."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:50

msgid "It shouldn't be a lot of work."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:51

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"So where do we start?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:52

msgid "I asked her, knowing there wasn't too much to do."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:55

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Actually, I'd like to ask you to do some carpentry. The shelf over there is broken.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:56

msgid "I followed her eyes to the deep end of the room."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:57

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"My......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:58

msgid "There was a bookshelf in the far corner of the room which was literally crumbling apart. The books that had fallen out just lay there on the floor."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:61

msgid "{Mei}\n\"It's too heavy for me to move it by myself.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:62

msgid "Of course it was. There was a load of magic tomes as thick as phone books resting on it."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:63

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Let me start by picking up the fallen books.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:64

msgid "After that I'll need to repair the shelves, put the books back, and clean up..."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:65

msgid "I think it's going to take my entire afternoon."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:66

msgid "I already used half of my day sleeping, and now I'm going to use the rest for this."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:67

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'll start with these books.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:68

msgid "Oh well. She bought me lunch, and it's my fault for oversleeping."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:71

msgid "{Mei}\n\"I'm so glad you're helping me out. We really needed to get some boys like you in.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:72

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No worries. This is piece of cake for me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:73

msgid "I acted tough, but I really would've been better off doing this before lunch. Getting paid in advance halved my motivation."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:76

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Thanks again. I'll pay you back for this when we're finished.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:77

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Eh? But you've already bought me lunch...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:80

msgid "{Mei}\n\"That's because you were stumbling around due to hunger. That's why I thought I'd help you get some energy back.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:83

msgid "{Mei}\n\"But it takes more than just a meal to motivate you, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:84

msgid "She read me like a book. Mei-sensei was really good at understanding how I feel."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:85

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No, a meal was enough.\nI'm glad that I can help you out.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:86

msgid "I actually did feel glad that I could. I really wanted to be encouraged and make myself of more use to her like this."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:87

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You can count on me!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:92

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Finally......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:93

msgid "It was almost getting dark by the time we finished everything."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:96

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Great job. Here's a towel.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:97

msgid "She handed me a cold towel she'd prepared for me in advance. It was nice and cool."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:100

msgid "{Mei}\n\"It turned out much better than I expected. I didn't know you were so good with your hands, Haruma-kun. Reliable guys like that are wonderful.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:101

msgid "She knew how to make me happy."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:102

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You really mean what you said?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:105

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Of course I do. You should be more confident about yourself.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:106

msgid "Her smile made me wanna believe her."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:109

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Thanks again. I'm glad you're here for me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:110

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"How did you take care of problems like this before the boys got here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:111

msgid "{Mei}\n\"We used to have to ask someone from the town to come help. Like the older man from the general store who comes and goes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:112

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"General store? ...Oh.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:113

msgid "Miya-san, that was his name."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:114

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"But I don't remember him hiring anyone else. Wasn't it hard for him to leave the shop empty and come help you out?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:117

msgid "{Mei}\n\"That was the problem. We always had to wait until he had a day off first.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:120

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Besides, he's not as reliable as you are.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:121

msgid "Mei-sensei spoke with a bitter smile. He sure didn't seem so reliable..."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:124

msgid "{Mei}\n\"It's a big comfort to have boys like you here with us. There's all these inconveniences, plus it's dangerous with just girls. Just having you guys here puts us at ease.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:125

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Thanks......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:126

msgid "Even I felt bashful after sensei went that far. I couldn't help but grin."
msgstr ""

#: 03505:129

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Can I ask you for some more favors during summer break?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03505:130

msgid "Her big attractive eyes were peering into my soul. I felt like she could suck my whole body into her eyes."
