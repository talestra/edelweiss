msgstr ""

#: 20382:194
msgid "This was my first time seeing the ocean from within. It was a totally different world from land. Now I got why Mizuki was so attracted to it."
msgstr ""

#: 20382:195
msgid "The sea looked a bit different from other ones down here in the south - the water wasn't the usual shade of emerald green."
msgstr ""

#: 20382:196
msgid "It was blue. A pure blue. It looked more like space than the ocean."
msgstr ""

#: 20382:197
msgid "All I saw was blue in all ways, numbing my sense of direction. The only thing I know is that brightness means up."
msgstr ""

#: 20382:198
msgid "It looks pretty deep down the bottom. The clear blue led down into a deeper ultramarine, then finally into a dark world without color."
msgstr ""

#: 20382:199
msgid "As I peered down into that abyss, an instinctual terror began to attack me."
msgstr ""

#: 20382:200
msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Glad to hear you finally understand some of what makes the sea great.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20382:226
msgid "Now I feel that, perhaps, I only knew about part of Mizuki because I didn't understand the greatness of the ocean."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 20382:234
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 20382:235
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"It's a silly point to fuss over, but I want to face the sea with my own ability, and just as I was born.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hmm, I didn't know you had your own sticking point about it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20382:239
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Yeah, I can get really picky when it comes to swimming. Anyways, I had a really great time today - I can genuinely put it down as one of my historic days.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20382:240
msgid "At first it sounded like she was exaggerating a bit, but come to think of it, I'd have to agree that today made a major impact for her."
