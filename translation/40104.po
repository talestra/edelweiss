msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 40104:53

msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Uuuhhh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40104:77
msgid "She moaned, and sounded like she was in a bad mood. Was it because she just woke up? Either way, she rubbed her sleepy eyes."

msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Mmmm...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40104:79
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

#: 40104:90
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"You didn't kiss me today, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40104:91
msgid "Natsume-chan made a weird comment, and wiped her lips. I thought I saw blood on her hand, but it was just my imagination."
msgstr ""

#: 40104:92
msgid "...but why blood? Isn't that a bit too weird, even for my imagination?"
msgstr ""

#: 40104:93
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What kiss are you talking about? I didn't kiss you while you were sleeping!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40104:95
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 40104:117
msgid "I had to ask Sakura and Mizuki to fetch Natsume-chan's clothes for me. I felt awkward going into the girls' dorm."

msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"I don't need them. I won't wear them anymore.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40104:147

"\"No 'then'. No 'then'.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40104:156
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 40104:186
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40104:187
msgid "She was nodding. I guess Natsume-chan's scared of Sakura."
msgstr ""

#: 40104:190
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"But speaking of scary people, Harucchi's worse if you ask me. After all, he's your natural enemy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40104:191
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Why would I be her natural enemy?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40104:194
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Because you're a lolicon. That's totally dangerous. Has he attacked you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40104:195
msgid "She said it jokingly, but Natsume-chan nodded her agreement seriously."
