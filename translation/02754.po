msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Haruma! Over here!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:22

msgstr ""

#: 02754:92

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Wasn't today's special European curry?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:93

#: 02754:94

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Today's special, please.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:95

msgid "{Cafeteria Lady}\n\"Got it. You want that in extra large?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:96

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I want it as big as I can get without having to pay extra.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:97

msgid "{Cafeteria Lady}\n\"All right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:98

msgid "An extra large is only 50 yen extra, but I'm trying to save some money."

msgstr ""

#: 02754:113

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What!? You don't have any money?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:114

msgstr ""

#: 02754:115

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What are you going to do?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:116

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"I'll be fine. Haruma's an adult.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:117

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I knew it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:118

msgid "I had a feeling that she didn't have any money, so I'm not too surprised."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:120

msgid "{Cafeteria Lady}\n\"So who's paying for the spaghetti?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:121

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Huh?\nYou hate boys?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:167

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"That's right. So you guys go away.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:168

msgid "She made \"shoo\"-ing motions with her hands, as if dealing with a herd of cats."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:171

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Ahaha. It actually feels great for her to abuse us! Do it some more!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:174

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"...you a pervert?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:175

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yes, he is. Stay away from him.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:178

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"I see. Haruma, you should be more careful when choosing your friends.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:181

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Hey, could you toss this water on my head while you shout 'You trash!'?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:182

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"...I see what you mean. From now on, I'll make sure that I'm more careful when making new friends.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:183

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"You definitely should.\""

msgstr ""

#: 02754:202

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"...Umeko and Suzu?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:203

msgid "Natsume-chan took a few quick looks at their faces and spit out some random names."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:206

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Ahaha, so close.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:209

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"By the way, my name's Sakura, not Umeko.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:212

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"...huh.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:213

msgid "She seemed entirely disinterested."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:216

msgid "{Rin}\n\"What are you eating?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:217

msgid "Fujisaki-san tried to lighten the mood."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:220

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Can't you see? Are those eyes in your head made out of glass?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:223

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Oh, umm, I'm sorry......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:226

msgstr ""

#: 02754:230

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Oh my god, you're adorable! That's settled, we're having our lunch with you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:234

msgid "Sakura seemed oblivious to how nastily Natsume-chan was treating them. Fujisaki-san sat down next to Sakura."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:237

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"How come these girls don't mind me being so rude to them?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:238

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I don't know either.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:240

msgid "I wasn't going to tell her that it's because her attacks are weak. Everything she says just comes out cute."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:247

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Since Natsume-chan's having spaghetti, I think I'll have the same.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:248

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"This is kinda oily, you know. I don't mind, but what about you, Suzu? You look like you already have a little extra meat on you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:251

msgid "{Rin}\n\"...what? I-I look like have extra m-meat on me?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:252

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"You do.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:253

msgid "Natsume's reply was immediate. The colour drained from Fujisaki-san's face as it hit the table."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:254

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Oh no... I think my precious summer is over...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:255

msgid "According to Fujisaki-san, her summer was finished before it had even begun."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:258

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Rin, you may be a little squishy, but that's just perfect!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:261

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Not for me...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:262

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Stay strong. Good things will happen.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:269

msgid "{Appo}\n\"That's so true, Natsume-chan!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:270

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Too little too late. I don't think she'll be able to get over it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:273

msgid "{Rin}\n\"I wish a meteor would hit and take back everything.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:274

msgid "Her mind had already entered self-destruction mode."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:282

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Hey Natsume-chan!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:283

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Why is this table so popular?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:284

msgid "And here come more people. It's really getting crowded over here."

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Everybody wants to talk to Natsume-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:290

msgid "{Natsume}\n*OMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOMNOM*"
msgstr ""

#: 02754:291

msgid "Natsume-chan seemed oblivious to the fact that she's the reason why our table's so crowded."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:294

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Blech. Haruma, eat my bell peppers for me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:295

msgid "She put all of her bell peppers to the side of her plate."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:296

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Those are good for you. You need to eat them.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:299

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Boo. Boo.\""

msgid "This conversation reminded me of how it was with my sister......"
msgstr ""

#: 02754:306

msgid "*NOM*"
msgstr ""

#: 02754:310

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"ACK!\""

msgid "Pierre gobbled down Natsume-chan's bell peppers in a second and a half."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:314

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Mmmmm, yummy. I can taste you on them. They smell like hay dried in the winds of Southern France.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:321

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Umm...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:324

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Let me just start by saying that was creepy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:331

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Huh? You're backing away? Did I do something wrong?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:332

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Everything you said was wrong.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:337

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Why are you eating my food, Thomas?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:342

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Huh? Thomas?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:343

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"I wanted Haruma to eat it for me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:344

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Does it matter? You just wanted to get rid of them, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:347

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"..................fine!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:348

msgid "She didn't sound fine at all. I wonder why she was focused on having me eat them so much?"
msgstr ""

#: 02754:355

msgstr ""

#: 02754:363

msgid "{Mei}\n\"This table sure is busy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:364

msgid "Now Mei-sensei was joining us as well. Natsume-chan was becoming super popular."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:370

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Let me ask you a question, Natsume-chan. What is this teacher's name?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:371

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Yagi-sensei.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:372

msgid "She replied instantly and incorrectly."
msgstr ""

#: 02754:377

msgid "{Mei}\n\"What? Why \"Yagi\"?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02754:382

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Oh, I get it! Because your first name sounds like a goat's bleat!\""
