"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see.\n"
"Well then, shall we?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:38
msgid "We were the only ones left in our classroom. We didn't know what was going to happen, so we headed to the laboratory in excitement."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:44
msgid "The room looked just like any other chemistry lab. The instruments lying out, the flasks, the test tubes, and the burners all looked the same as chemistry equipment."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:49
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"So this is an alchemist's atelier? It does kind of have that feeling to it.\""

msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"

#: 00806:54
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"

#: 00806:58
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"The girls have already formed their groups, so Kazushi, you can sit with me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:59
msgid "Just as Ran said, most of the girls were already sitting in their groups, so we took our seats beside her."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:63
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Okay, the rest is up to you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:65
msgid "And with that, Ran leaned over on the desk. She was intending to sleep through class."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, Ran, we don't know heads or tails from this stuff, so we're counting on you to help.\""

#: 00806:69
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Not only that, the principal's coming to watch us today. We have to show her our good side.\""

#: 00806:74
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oh yeah, she is. That means I can't sleep!\""

"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00806:78

msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"

"{Appo}\n"

#: 00806:87
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Maybe we did.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:88
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But didn't Haruka say that anyone could do it with practice?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:92
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I'm especially untalented, I guess. Well, most people manage to get some reaction or another, but me? None at all.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:95
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"That's why I hate this class. You could even say I loathe it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:96
msgid "She clenched her fist in hatred. She must really suck at this."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:100
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"I think this girl's no good to us. Who else can we partner up with...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:103
msgid "We looked around the room, but all of the girls were chatting and acting like we weren't even there."

"{Rin}\n"
"\"Huh? M-me? Uhh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:113
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Sorry, guys. The principal is coming today, right? Rin gets stage fright, so she won't be of much help.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:114
msgid "We were the ones under major pressure to show off our good side today."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:115
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't worry about it, then. This is our problem to deal with.\""

msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"He's right. Maybe next time?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:124
msgid ""

"{Pierre}\n"

#: 00806:141

"{Appo}\n"
"\"Deh-heh, deh-heh!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:147
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00806:154
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Appo always starts doing that if we take our eyes off him.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:155
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"But I really don't think there are any other girls who will pair with us.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:156
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Looks like it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:157
msgid "We should thank Ran just for being here with us."

#: 00806:160
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
" *zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz*"
msgstr ""

#: 00806:165
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What......?\n"
"Sorry, sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:166
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Are you really that bad at this class? Maybe it's genuinely difficult.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:170
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Of course it's difficult. It's similar to magic, right? Is it something that can even be taught?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:171
msgid "He's got a point. Magic always seems like it would be impossible without already pos-sessing some kind of strange power."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:175
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oh, don't worry about that. Alchemy isn't magic or some superpower, it's just another type of science.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:176
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So you don't need to be from a pureblood wizarding family or anything?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:177
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I don't think so. As long as you follow the proper procedures, anyone can use it to some extent.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:180
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Not that it's done me any good, though!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:181
msgid "Even though she's laughing on the outside, I'm sure that deep inside she's wishing that she was good at it."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:182
msgid "If she had any talent for alchemy, she'd probably be using it to synthesise money."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:188
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"I still think it sounds hard. Do you think we have a chance?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:189
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"I'm going to make myself master it to overcome this disgrace!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:193
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oh, no, no, you guys'll be fine. The only one who's never succeeded in this class is me. I've seen everyone else do great.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:196
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Seriously? Then we can turn lead into gold?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:199
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oh, don't get your hopes up or you'll be let down. That's not an easy thing to do. Besides, the alchemy here is...\""

"{Haruka}\n"

#: 00806:201

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

#: 00806:211
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Tee-hee, I came again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:212
msgid "Haruka stuck her tongue out. This girl never learns."

msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00806:220

"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Oh, you know. But today's special. Grandm...The principal is coming to observe, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:224
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"That's why we're so nervous! So please go on a date with us!!\""

"{Haruka}\n"
"\"What? I don't get what you're talking about.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:231

msgstr ""

#: 00806:242

msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Let's see...\n"
"Hey, Mizuki-chan! Come join us!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:258

#: 00806:268

#: 00806:271
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

"You're more than welcome here!\""

msgstr ""

#: 00806:275
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00806:278

msgstr ""

#: 00806:283
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Mizuki-chan is a bit of a shy girl, so be nice to her, boys.\""

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"This isn't a dating service!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:288
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Mizuki, you know it's no use trying to make Haruka understand. Now we have three girls, and while I'm useless, we have Haruka with us.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:291
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Fine. It's a lot easier to do it with Haruka.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:292
msgid "They were both relying on Haruka. Was Haruka that good at alchemy?"
msgstr ""

#: 00806:295
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh yeah. As we were saying...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:296
msgid "What was it Haruka said? Bring an object one step closer to its ideal form?"
msgstr ""

#: 00806:297
msgid "I'd never heard anything like that."

#: 00806:300
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"

#: 00806:306
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00806:307
msgid ""

#: 00806:326

msgstr ""

#: 00806:348
msgid "I hate it when she stares at me. I can't calm down at all."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:349

msgstr ""

#: 00806:353
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:354
msgid "Maybe she's actually looking at Haruka. Yeah, she doesn't know about me anyways."

msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Look at how her eyes went straight for Kazushi.\n"
"Dude, she so thinks you're hot.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I thought you already lay claim to her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:362

msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Too old.\""

#: 00806:374

msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"It's the first class of the semester, Appo.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:410
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Right, then, let's begin. As I'm sure you've all heard already, this class is about alchemy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:411
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Since the boys haven't studied alchemy before, let me give you all a brief synopsis.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:412
msgid "So far this is no different from anything else we've studied."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:415
msgid "Mei-sensei wrote \"Alchemy\" on the chalkboard."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:420
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I'm sure you've all heard of alchemy before. It's most commonly recognized as a method of turning lead into gold.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:421
msgid "The class rang out with a surprised reaction from the boys."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:422
msgid "Of course they would. We were going to learn how to turn lead into gold."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:426
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"This is because alchemy's original aim was to transform base metals into gold. However, there are now several different branches of alchemy, and the science has become specialized.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:432
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Excuse me! That was too difficult for me to understand!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:433

msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"

msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Please teach me gently!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:439
msgid "The girls looked at him in shock, but Appo didn't care. Mei-sensei was the only one in his eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:443
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Alright. In other words, rather than remaining a technology exclusively for turning lead into gold, alchemy has become a science adapted for many other purposes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:447
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Like what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:449
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"The alchemy we study at this school is a technology used for improving our daily lives. We have adapted it for various fields, and even use it to create manufactured goods.\""

"\"Manufactured goods? You sell things?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:458
msgid ""

"All of the fruits and vegetables for sale are the product of our alchemy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:461
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"That's why the vegetables are able to be so big while retaining their natural flavour.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:465
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Oh yeah, I remember.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00806:466
msgid "I remembered the grocer's we saw that day too. There were onions as big as my head. I didn't know those were made with alchemy."
msgstr ""

#: 00806:470
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I think it will be a lot easier to demonstrate, so allow me to show you.\""

#: 00806:472

"{Appo}\n"
