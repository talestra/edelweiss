"I said, a bit jokingly. I was afraid of what would happen if she suddenly rejected me.\n"
"Huh? Why am I afraid?"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:12
msgid "......that's when I realized I was seriously starting to like her."

"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hee-hee. Be careful, I may take that offer seriously.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:16
msgid "She flashed her usual smile back at me. I was relieved, but at the same time I couldn't help being greedy."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:17
msgid "I wanted to get closer to her."

"\"Absolutely!\n"
"You can call me anytime!\n"
"Even if it's midnight!\""

"{Mei}\n"
"\"Any time?\n"
"Does that include early morning? I'm guessing you forgot what time you woke up this afternoon.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:22

"{Mei}\n"
"\"You have? Give a man three days... or so it goes, I guess. You boys are so dependable.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:28
msgid "Even as I gave her desperate excuses, she gave me a gentle smile that glowed madder red in the light of sunset. I could almost sigh at this twilight scene which looked right out of a painting."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:29
msgid "As the faint light faded in the distance, hardly reaching us, I could barely make her out at this distance. Her figure was growing vague, projected before me like a wondrous dream."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:31
msgid "Her beautiful silhouette was outlined by the setting sun, bringing out a mysterious aspect to her figure. The scene made my heart ache."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:32
msgid "She looked so beautiful I didn't know what to do. I couldn't take my eyes off her. My heart was pounding."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:33
msgid "What's wrong with me? I've never felt like this with her before."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:34
msgid "Is what I'm feeling love?"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:35
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What's wrong?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:36
msgid "She noticed how I kept staring at her, and looked at me curiously with a gentle smile. I froze, not knowing what to say to her."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:37
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Umm......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:38
msgid "She truly looked absolutely beautiful, and I was at a loss for words. I knew she was beautiful, but had she always been this otherworldly?"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:39
msgid "My longing to stay here watching her like this... grew stronger and stronger."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:40
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"*Sigh*"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:41
msgid "I caught myself sighing. I realized my feelings for her were growing ever stronger and out of my control."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:42
msgid "I really like this lady. Not just as a teacher, but as a woman."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:45

"{Mei}\n"
"\"Haruma-kun?\n"
"Are you all right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:46
msgid "She gazed at me."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:47
msgid "Her attractive eyes were looking into me."

#: 03515:50
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Are you all right? Do you feel sluggish? It's not heatstroke, is it...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:51
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm fine.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:53
msgid "I averted my eyes. Once I found these feelings, I couldn't look her in the eye."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:54
msgid "After all, this was amazing. The person I loved was right before my eyes. I could reach out and touch her."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:57
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Are you sure you're OK? You're acting strange?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:58
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's nothing!\n"
"I'm perfectly fine!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:61
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Did you get heat stroke? Your face is all red.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:62
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's actually because of......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:63
msgid "What should I say? Should I tell her how I feel? No, if I said that all of a sudden, it's quite likely she'd reject me."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:65
msgid "After all, she's a teacher and I'm her student. I have no doubt she'll turn me down on those grounds, and it'll be over. I need to think this over carefully and plan my approach."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:67
msgid "Maybe I should ask the guys. Pierre's an expert on these sorts of things, and Appo has a girlfriend."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:68
msgid "That's a good idea. Even though Mei-sensei's a million times more beautiful than her, Fuusen is still a girl. As a man with experience, I'm sure he'll have good advice."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:69
msgid "It'll be at least a little better than going in without a plan and failing. Alright, I'll do that."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:71
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I like you!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:74
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:75
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"(Shit! What did I just do!?)"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:76
msgid "I surprised myself. How did I manage to do the exact opposite of what I was planning?!"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:77
msgid "How stupid of me to say that out of the blue!"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:78
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Haruma-kun? I don't think I heard you correctly...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:79
msgid "Sensei didn't hide her confusion when she asked me as I scratched at my head. I thought she didn't understand more than didn't hear."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:80
msgid ""
"Maybe I can still cover things up and fix this situation?\n"
"I can ignore what I said earlier...\n"
"Here goes..."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:82
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm in love with you! Please go out with me!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:85
msgid "Oops! I did it again! I said it as clear as clear could be."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:86
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Huh? ...y-you love... me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:87
msgid "Mei-sensei became panicked as the weight of what I said sank in. This might be a good sign - the fact that she doesn't know how to react."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:90
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"......Ah, umm... ahem.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:91
msgid "But soon, she disguised herself with a calm smile."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:94
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Well, I'm flattered. I like you, too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:95
msgid "It was exactly how a teacher should respond to her student in this kind of situation, but it wasn't what I wanted to hear."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:96
msgid "Even if it was spur of the moment, now that I'd confessed I didn't want her to pull us back to being teacher and student."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:97
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm serious. I love you, Mei-sensei.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:100
msgid "Once I'd already confessed, I could feel my courage welling up. There was no turning back for me now."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:101
msgid "I knew she'd probably never thought of me in this way before. I was starting from zero. I had nothing to lose."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:104
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You are serious......\n"
"You mean you want to be in a relationship with me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:105
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Of course I am. That's what I meant, or I wouldn't have said it again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:108
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I see. That's true...\n"
"But you're my student.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:109
msgid ""
"I didn't want to hear that cliched answer.\n"
"Does it really matter that much?"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:110
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I am serious. I love you as a woman.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:111
msgid "I looked her in the eyes and said it once more. She blinked in confusion, and then let out a big sigh."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:114
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You make it sound so easy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:115
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It is easy. I love you. All that's left is for you to say how you feel about me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:118
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"How I feel about you......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:119
msgid "She tried to speak, but the words wouldn't come from her mouth."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:122
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"...what about the age difference? I'm a lot older than you are.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:123
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"There are so many pretty girls here that are your age. Why me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:124
msgid "Instead of answering my question, she threw back a question to me. But my answer was already set."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:125
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's because I'm in love with you. If you love someone, age doesn't matter, does it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:128
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I don't know......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:129
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Of course it doesn't. There are plenty of couples whose ages are far more distant than ours.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:130
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I know that...... But it's not just about age difference. I have my position as your teacher to consider.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:131
msgid "She looked at me as if she needed me to tell her what to say."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:134
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I like you too. Isn't that good enough?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:135
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You only like me as a student. That's not what I want. I want to be the number one guy for you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:138
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"My number one......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:139
msgid "Her eyes were wandering around, staring out through the windows. The sky was a blazing vermillion from the sunset."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:140
msgid "As she gazed at that blazing sky, her silhouette looked like a little girl who had yet to understand the world, leaving a wondrous impression."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:141
msgid "She furrowed her brows and shook her head sullenly."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:144
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I'm sorry.\n"
"I don't think I can do that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:145
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:146
msgid ""
"It hit me harder than Yagami-sensei's toughest blows.\n"
"Mei-sensei just apologized to me.\n"
"Does this mean I've been rejected?"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:147
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"...you can't do it? I know we've only just met, and that I'm your student, and I may be an undependable kid, but...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:150
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"No, it's not.\n"
"It's not you. I just can't figure out......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:151
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Can't figure out......?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:154
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I don't think I've ever once felt 'love' before.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:155
msgid ""
"She continued apologizing.\n"
"She's never felt love before..."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:156
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"...you've never been in love before?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:157
msgid "She shook her head slowly."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Never?\""

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 03515:162
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You don't know?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:163
msgid "I didn't expect that. What does she mean she doesn't know?"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:164
msgid "......oh yeah......"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:167
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"At the very least, I've never felt love since I became a teacher here. It was an all girls school, and there weren't any young men on the island either.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:168
msgid "I could understand that. The only other men here were in their 40s or 50s."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:169
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But before you started teaching...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:170
msgid "She graduated from Eiden Academy. After that, she had to go to college for her teacher's license. So she had to have left this island."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:171
msgid "Even if she didn't live on campus, lots of people meet up in college. Yet to Mei-sensei that time..."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:172
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"...has all been forgotten, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:173
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Yes......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:174
msgid "That's right. She doesn't remember anything of the time from before she started teaching on this island."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:177
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I don't remember anything about whether or not I've been in a relationship or ever fallen in love with somebody. I don't remember anything.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:178
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Maybe that's why. Maybe that's the reason why I can't understand what it's like to be in love with somebody.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:179
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's how you feel......?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:180
msgid "I felt like I'd been cheated. Is love even something you have to understand?"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:183
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I'm sorry. I can't be in a special relationship with you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:184
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ah......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:185
msgid "The result was the same: I was rejected in no time. *orz*"

#: 03515:186
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm finished... I'm going on a journey...... with a Seishun 18 ticket...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:189
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh, you still need to file for permission to go on a long excursion, even though it's summer break. You'll also need to give them a destination and a reason.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:190
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"North...... Lost the will to live after having my heart broken...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:193
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"The will to live? ...Stop being so dramatic.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:194
msgid ""
"She sounded shocked by my childish behavior.\n"
"She sounded like this wasn't a big deal.\n"
"Maybe she really didn't understand what love was."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:197
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Do you really have to be so depressed? There are plenty of pretty young girls here. I'm sure you'll find someone else very soon.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:198
msgid ""
"Now I'm convinced.\n"
"She doesn't understand it at all."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:199

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Now you're overreacting.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:203
msgid "I don't think she'll ever get it. There's no hope that she'll understand how I feel."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:204
msgid "Since she can't understand (or remember) how it feels to be in love, she can't understand how serious my confession is."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:205
msgid "Am I going to be rejected without even a decent reason?"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:206
msgid "I'm not going to let this happen. I'm not going to end my summer this way."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:207
msgid "Because my summer's just started."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm not going to give up.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:211

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Didn't you hear me?\n"
"I can't have a special relationship with you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:213
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is that because I'm your student?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:216
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Including you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:218
msgid "She can't go out with me because I'm her student. That means there's still hope! ...at least that's the way I'll have to take it."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:219
msgid "It's not like she doesn't want me!"
msgstr ""

#: 03515:220
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

#: 03515:223
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Just for summer break?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03515:224
msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 03515:239
msgid "I'm beyond desperate. I need to change the conclusion she's reached - that would mean game over."
msgstr ""

#: 03515:240
