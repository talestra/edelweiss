"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"What're you smiling about? Are you making fun of us?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01706:258
msgid ""

"\"No, not at all. More importantly, what are you two cleaning? Do you need any help?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01706:261
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 01706:285

msgstr ""

#: 01706:293
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Oh, then can you change the light bulb in the principal's office? It burned out, but the ceiling's so high we can barely reach it with a stepladder and we're afraid.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01706:294
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 01706:308
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 01706:313
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"But the one in the hall needs to get changed! I'm too scared to go the bathroom at night with the lights out.\""

#: 01706:314
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 01706:336
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 01706:339
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Why did they have to go and make us coed! We were happy enough with just girls! Argh, it's so irritating!\""

msgstr ""

#: 01706:357
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"It came from inside I think?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01706:358
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Probably.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01706:359
msgid "We could sense somebody panicking inside. So it must have come from the lab section."
msgstr ""

#: 01706:363
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"That sounded bad, didn't it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01706:366
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
