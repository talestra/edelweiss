#: 40304:161
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"

"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Haruma, is it somehow inconvenient for you if I stay here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:172
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

"{Rin}\n"
"\"Umm... am I that fat?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:188
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Regardless of the truth, it seems like you're stuck as 'the fatty' in Natsume-chan's mind.\""

"{Mizuki}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 40304:201
msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 40304:226
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"A tunnel of bugs, huh.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:227
msgid "I thought it was a great expression. I felt we were surrounded by the sound of insects, and it really was like a tunnel."
msgstr ""

#: 40304:228
msgid "I felt emotional, walking with her under the stars, surrounded by the sound of bugs."
msgstr ""

#: 40304:229
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm really happy to be able to walk with you like this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:232
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"You are...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:234
msgid "She mumbled, and looked down at her feet. She was already walking slower than I was, so that made her fall further behind."
msgstr ""

#: 40304:236
msgid "I had gotten pretty far ahead of her, so I stopped to wait for her. I reached out my hand to Natsume-chan as she caught up with me, but she looked down."

#: 40304:239
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Aren't you scared of me, Haruma?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:240
msgid "She asked, looking at my hand."
msgstr ""

#: 40304:241
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Why would I be scared? Why are you worried about that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:244
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Didn't you hear about it from Papa?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:245
msgid "This must be about the stone inside of her. Could it be that Natsume-chan was scared as well?"
msgstr ""

#: 40304:246
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm sure you'll be fine.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:247
msgid "I took her hand in mine since she just kept staring at it."

#: 40304:248
msgid "I don't know much, but I feel like I can be a big help to her because of that."
msgstr ""

#: 40304:249
msgid "That's why I should be on her side from now on. I'll blow away whatever fears she has and share my happiness with her."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid "She faintly gripped my hand back."
msgstr ""

#: 40304:255
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You got Miya-san on your side as well. He's an alchemaniac, right? In that case, he'll be able to do something about that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:258
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"You're right. That's the only thing he's good at.\""

#: 40304:266
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Don't be so proud of it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:267
msgid "Natsume-chan smiled. I smiled as well, so that she could keep on smiling."
msgstr ""

#: 40304:268
msgid "I think that's the key for us. That's how I felt."
msgstr ""

#: 40304:275
msgid ""
"{Amamiya}\n"
"\"Here you go. Would you like some tea?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:276
msgid "He put a cup of hot tea in front of me. This was my first time being in his house like this."
msgstr ""

#: 40304:277
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Thank you. But, I'll be leaving soon.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:278
msgid "I just walked her home. I shouldn't be spoiling the family reunion by staying too long."
msgstr ""

#: 40304:282
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Don't worry. It's the cheap stuff, but enjoy yourself anyway.\""

msgid ""
"{Amamiya}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 40304:290
msgid ""
"{Amamiya}\n"

#: 40304:292
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"OK, so I guess I'll stay a while.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:293
msgid "If that's the case, then I should stay. I'll listen as I enjoy the tea."

msgid ""
"{Amamiya}\n"
"\"It was just like this island, but there wasn't anybody there?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:299
msgid "Miya-san was talking about the place where Natsume-chan was. He said the only people who knew about that place were Natsume-chan and I."

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You don't know about that place either, Miya-san?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:303
msgid ""
"{Amamiya}\n"
"\"I've caught glimpses. Any competent alchemist should be able to feel the existence of a world that is not our own.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:307
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 40304:308
msgid ""
"{Amamiya}\n"
"\"Let alone for me to become assimilated into that world like you and Natsume-chan were. Only a handful of chosen people can do that.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Really? But...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:310
msgid "I thought I understood, but then I got confused right away. Why was I able to find Natsume-chan in that world?"
msgstr ""

#: 40304:314
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"You entered through your dreams.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:315

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, it was a dream to me. Was it not a dream?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:317
msgid "I thought I didn't remember it because it was a dream. After all, you usually forget what you dreamed about, and only thing you remember is the fuzzy surface of the dream."
msgstr ""

#: 40304:321
msgid ""
"{Amamiya}\n"
"\"Dreams are a common entrance into the other world. Anyone pursuing our line of work has experienced it to some extent.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 40304:351
msgid ""
"{Amamiya}\n"
"\"They say 'Heroes enjoy the pleasures of the flesh'. The great men who made their mark on history were often unrivaled by others in their desires. That vitality is one kind of talent.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh, is it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40304:354
msgid "It sounded like an embarrassing talent."
msgstr ""

#: 40304:358
msgid ""
"{Amamiya}\n"
