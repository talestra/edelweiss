#: 30243:130
msgid "I'd almost thought that she'd given up on alchemy because she was untalented... so what changed her mind?"
msgstr ""

#: 30243:131
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Okay! I got it! I'll help you out!!\""

#: 30243:159
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Here? Hey...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30243:164

#: 30243:167
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Come on. Let's get out of here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30243:169
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"No! We should stay here. It'll be more suspicious if we leave now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30243:170
msgid "There was still someone out there. I wonder who?"

#: 30243:172
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

#: 30243:174
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What's he looking for?\n"
"Dammit, we're gonna be stuck here for ages.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30243:175
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I can explain to Appo...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30243:176
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What kinda explanation are you gonna make like this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30243:177

msgstr ""

#: 30243:178
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Whoah...h-hey...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30243:179
msgid "Something's off. I thought it felt odd when she grabbed my crotch, and it looked like I was hard."
msgstr ""

#: 30243:180
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"See? You're still like this. Any explanation you give him is just going to come off as an excuse.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30243:181
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"True.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30243:182
msgid "But it wasn't going down soon. No wonder - Ran was pressed up against me like this."

#: 30243:183
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Ah, hey... don't press it against me or you'll start turning me on.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30243:184

msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Hey, Kazushi, can't you calm it down?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30243:186

msgstr ""

#: 30243:187
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"

#: 30243:190
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
