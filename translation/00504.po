#: 00504:38
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I guess your stomach really does talk when it's got something to say.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:39

msgstr ""

#: 00504:68
msgid "She didn't answer, she just kept staring at me rudely, without restraint."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:69
msgid "Even I can read between a few lines. I'm pretty sure she doesn't like me. Considering what happened, I guess that's highly likely."

#: 00504:70
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Are you annoyed with me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:71
msgid "That's what her eyes were saying to me."

msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:73
msgid "She still wouldn't answer, and she kept staring at me just as rudely. It didn't look like she was ignoring me, though."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

#: 00504:76
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:77
msgid "She nodded slightly while holding the bread in her hands. She didn't look away. I was reflected in her charming eyes."

#: 00504:78
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Do you, um, blink? You'll dry your eyes out.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:80
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:81
msgid "She blinked once and continued to look at me, like a dog waiting for its master to issue a command."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:82
msgid "It left me obligated to say something."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:83
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Um... I bought the same kind of bread for lunch. It's good, isn't it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:84
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:85
msgid "She nodded. Good, at least she's not ignoring me. If I talk to her, she'll at least answer me."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:86
msgid "But it's not like we were having a real conversation either."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:87
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00504:89
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"............\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:90
msgid "She started eating like a squirrel."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:91
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Do you always eat it in little bites like that? Isn't it better if you take a nice big bite out of it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:93
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"......!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:94

msgstr ""

#: 00504:95
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"......Shoo.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:96
msgid "It was a threat!"

"{Natsume}\n"
"\"............\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:103

#: 00504:104
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Am I that handsome?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:105
msgid "I said so jokingly, but after that accident, maybe she's fallen for me?"
msgstr ""

#: 00504:107
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:108
msgid "She didn't think so at all. Oh well."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:109
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Women aren't attracted by a pretty face anyways, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:110
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:111
msgid "She rejected me flat out! So it is about looks? Looks are all that matter?!"
msgstr ""

#: 00504:112
msgid "So if I'm not handsome to her, then that means I don't mean a thing to her. But then why does she keep staring at me?"
msgstr ""

#: 00504:113
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is my face funny?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:115
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:116
msgid "She gave me a big nod. That was easy to understand."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:117
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see. I have a funny face. Is that why you keep looking at me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:118
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"............\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:119
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see. It's that funny looking.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:120
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"............\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:121
msgid "She gave me a few nods this time."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Thanks......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:123
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"???\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:125
msgid "Well, at least my face is funny instead of being scary or creepy. It was still a shock, though. Now both my stomach and my heart were empty."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:126
msgid "*Poke poke.*"
msgstr ""

#: 00504:129
msgid "I looked up as she poked me. I found her peering down at me."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:130
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:131
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:132
msgid "She tore her bread in half and offered me one of the pieces."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:133
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? For me? You're giving it to me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:136
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:137
msgid "It seems so."

#: 00504:138
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Are you sure I can have this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:141
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"............\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:142
msgid "It seems I could. As I hesitated to take it, she pushed one half against me."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:143
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, this is the side you were eating, Natsume-chan. It's damp.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:146
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"So what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:147
msgid "That's true. Although it was an accident, we'd already kissed. What did eating her bread matter now?"
msgstr ""

#: 00504:148
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Don't worry. I don't have any strange cooties.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:149
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm not worried about that. I don't care if you don't mind.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:152
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"It's better than letting you kiss me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:153
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I said I'm sorry. I didn't know you such a persistent girl.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:156
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Turning defiant?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:157
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No, I'm not trying to be. Alright, I appreciate your offer.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:160
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"............\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:161
msgid "It's hard to eat when she's staring at me. Not to mention, the bread's damp from her mouth."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:164
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:165
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'll eat it, OK?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:166
msgid "Urged on by her eyes, I took a big bite out of the bread. I felt the dampness left by her lips spread inside my mouth."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:167
msgid "It was kind of sweet."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:170
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Did you eat it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:171
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yes......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:174
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Good.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:176
msgid "Satisfied with that, she bit back into her own half of the bread. Meanwhile, I swallowed the rest of mine down."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:177
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Thanks. That was delicious.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:180
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:181
msgid "Natsume-chan was still nibbling away at her bread. Her expression hadn't changed at all."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:182
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Thanks.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:185
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"No worries.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:186
msgid "She was cold and curt, but she was kind so there had to be more to her than just that. It was hard to tell what she was like."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:187
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Do you always eat by yourself? What about your friends?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:190
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00504:191
msgid ""

#: 00504:198
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"All right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:200
msgid "I lied down on the grass again. The grass felt relaxing against my back."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:201
msgid "It was soft, and just warm enough to make me forget my hunger and feel sleepy."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:202
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yawwwwwn...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:205
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Oh, taking a nap?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:206
msgid "I sensed a hint of disappointment in her tone."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00504:219
msgid "Actually I'm already about to fall asleep."
msgstr ""

#: 00504:220
msgid "My eyelids grew so heavy they fell shut."

#: 00504:222
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00504:223

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, we have a lunch break every day. I'll just have to do better next time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00504:238
msgid "I should head back to the classroom before the next class starts. If I keep being late, the girls will have an even worse impression of me."
