msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Ngh... you're fast.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:11

msgid "Natsume-chan put down her chopsticks, muttering in frustration. I won the speed-eating competition."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:12

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hahaha. You challenged me ten years too early. No, make that a hundred years too early. I'll eat this dessert as my prize.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:15

msgid "Her pudding was mine, now. Natsume-chan glared at me with tearful eyes, but a deal's a deal. I gladly took it."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:16

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Haruma wasn't fair. You swallowed it without hardly chewing it, didn't you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:17

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I didn't have time to taste it since it was a competition.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:22

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Well, I spent a lot of time on it, so I wish you would've at least tasted it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:23

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, sorry about that. I'll have another one, and I'll enjoy the taste this time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:27

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"How about another round? Please, another round!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:28

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Are you kidding me? You don't know when to stop, do you? Okay, I'll beat you head-on again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:33

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Oh, I know he won't taste it again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:38

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Hey, wait a second.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:39

msgid "Mei-sensei was running up to us."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:40

msgid "{Mei}\n\"You're done eating, aren't you, Haruma-kun?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:41

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Kind of... But we were about to have a second round.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:44

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Before you start that, can you go fetch somebody?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:45

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Somebody?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:50

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, Miya-san.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:53

msgid "Miya-san was waiting when I reached the spot Mei-sensei asked me to go to."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:56

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"Thank God! I'm glad it was you picking me up.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:57

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Why are you here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:58

msgid "There was a huge trunk underneath his feet. He looked like he was moving somewhere."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:61

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"As a matter of fact, I'll be living here starting today.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:62

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Are you really moving in?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:63

msgid "No wonder he had a ton of luggage."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:64

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"The director of the school store went on a summer holiday, and he won't come back until the second semester.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:65

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"So you're here as his replacement?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:68

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"Well, to be honest, that's just an excuse.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:69

msgid "Suddenly, Miya-san made a stern face, and drooped his shoulders. Something must've happened to him."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:72

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"Actually, I had a dream about Natsume, and it wasn't good one.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:73

msgid "Miya-san's face turned even more serious. I wondered how bad it was, and started worrying a little bit."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:74

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What kind of dream did you have?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:75

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"I hate to even talk about, but in the dream, Natsume was shedding blood.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:76

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh... Blood?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:77

msgid "At first, I visualized an image like the stain she left on her sheets. I hoped Miya-san's bad premonition wasn't from us..."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:78

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"I'm afraid that if something happened to Natsume... I wouldn't be able to let them off easily. Thanks to you, Haruma-kun, I'm ready for anything for her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:79

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You can't let them off? Wh-what do you plan to do?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:82

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"Look at this, I've already prepared myself.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:83

msgid "Miya-san put down a slim parcel he carried on his shoulder. He opened it, and I saw a katana in there."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:84

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"W-what's that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:87

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"This is a noted sword passed down through the generations in my family. I know I don't look it, but I used to practice kendo. It was only at school, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:88

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Th-that's...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:89

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"I can kill anything with this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:90

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'm sure you can.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:91

msgid "I knew what even a first-timer could do that with one of those. Oh, shit. If he finds out I did Natsume-chan, he's gonna kill me!"
msgstr ""

#: 40404:92

msgid "I knew Miya-san would kill me without hesitation with the fatherly attitude he regained."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:93

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Uh, umm, I should help carry your luggage, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:94

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"Oh, thank you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:95

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'll get that for you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:96

msgid "I casually reached out my hand to take the sword."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:99

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"Don't worry about this. I'll get it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:100

msgid "He took it first. I failed."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:101

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"...Then shall we head out?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:106

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Oh, Haruma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:107

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, Natsume-chan, good timing.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:112

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"Hey, Natsume. Did you know your dad will be working at the school store?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:115

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"...what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:116

msgid "Natsume-chan made a disgusted face."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:119

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"W-why are you making a face like that? Don't you want to be with Papa?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:120

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"It's embarrassing to have your parents at school.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:121

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, yeah, I know what you mean.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:122

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"Oh, come on...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:125

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Starting tomorrow you make yourself small in the corner and be sure not to stand out.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:128

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"O-okay...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:129

msgid "I knew he came all the way here to protect Natsume-chan. How sad it is to be a father."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:130

msgid "I wondered if my dad would be nice like him if I was a girl."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:131

msgid "I know my dad used to buy secretly buy gifts for my little sister. I wished I was born a girl."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:135

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"So, what were you here to pick up, Natsume-chan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:138

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"I came here to buy my school supplies for tomorrow.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:139

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:140

msgid "Natsume-chan will finally be starting at our school. Well, it's gonna be fun."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:145

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"Well, I can buy the stuff you'll need for you as a gift. Consider it a late present from me in honor of your admission. Do they sell schoolbags here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:146

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Not the kind you're looking for. This isn't an elementary school.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:149

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"This guy was gone when I needed my first schoolbag. I think time must have stopped for him since then.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:152

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"Tell me anything you want from the store. Papa's poor, but I can give you whatever you want as a gift.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:153

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You still have to pay, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:154

msgid "He was the kind of father who tried doing favors for his daughter, even it meant abusing his authority. It was hard to speak up against his tearful effort."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:157

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"That's enough. You're embarrassing, so go away.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:160

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"What? Papa's embarrassing? How?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:163

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Just go away! Be more considerate, and leave me alone with Haruma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:164

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"W-what do you think you're going to do with him alone?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:167

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"There's nothing wrong with two lovers being alone together, is there?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:168

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, Natsume-chan...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:171

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"Lovers...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:172

msgid "HHHHHH?! Miya-san grabbed the katana!!"
msgstr ""

#: 40404:173

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"P-Papa hasn't heard anything about that. This must be a misunderstanding.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:174

msgid "H-he's smiling! He's angry and smiling! I didn't know it was possible to do both!"
msgstr ""

#: 40404:177

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"You hadn't? Haruma had a crush on me, so I decided to go out with him.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:178

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? Is that how it went?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:182

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"O-ohh? Haruma-kun likes Natsume, huh? Haruma-kun, aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:183

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I-I'm not!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:184

msgid "SHHHNK!"
msgstr ""

#: 40404:185

msgid "H-he just unsheathed his sword!!"
msgstr ""

#: 40404:186

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Umm, uhh, well...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:187

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Please let me go out with Natsume-chan!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:189

msgid "I bowed at his feet and tried to find a way out with sincerity."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:190

msgid "Wh-what!?"
msgstr ""

#: 40404:193

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"I won't permit it!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:195

msgid "FWWWM!!"
msgstr ""

#: 40404:196

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh...?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:197

msgid "I lifted my head since I felt the wind blast, then saw his sword flash by in front of my face."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:198

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hhhh?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:199

msgid "He was an ogre. He was an ogre named father."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:203

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Haruma! Run now!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:205

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hhhhhah!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:207

msgid "I dashed away as soon as Natsume-chan spoke out."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:210

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"Wait!!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:214

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Ugyaaaaaaahhh!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:215

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Ah, Haruma!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:216

msgid "And that was how our summer holidays came to an end."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:219

msgid "And so the new semester began."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:224

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"What do you mean we're in different classes?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:225

msgid "Natsume-chan didn't waste time getting pissed off during the new term. Her face turned into a scowl, and she threw a negative aura all around her."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:226

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What can you do? We ARE in a different grades.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:229

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"There's gotta be SOMETHING we can do. You give up way too easily, that's why your grades are low.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:230

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Don't talk about my grades. They have nothing to do with this problem.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:235

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Take it easy, you guys.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:238

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"How can I take it easy in this situation? Who? Who should I go complain to?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:239

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I don't know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:240

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"I guess that'd be Grandma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:241

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Hisae, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:242

msgid "Natsume-chan took a piece of paper from her skirt pocket after thinking for a while. It looked like a store flyer."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:245

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Oh, you're the kind who uses flyers for scrap paper?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:248

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"It'd be a waste of paper to just throw them away.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:249

msgid "She scribbled on the back of flyer as she came out about being lower middle class."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:250

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What are you going to do with it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:253

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Watch.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:254

msgid "SCRIBBLE..."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:255

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What are you writing? 'Hisae, die...' What!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:258

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Ah, ahaha... A-are you going to kill Grandma?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:259

msgid "Haruka, who had just seen a death sentence for her family member, let out a dry laugh."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:260

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"It's not funny.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:263

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Because...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:266

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Watch. I cut this into the shape of a monster, and give it a drop of my blood. Then you'll see a monster that can devour Hisae.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:267

msgid "What an awful thing to think..."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:268

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Can you do that? Is that alchemy too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:271

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Alchemy doesn't do that kind of thing. You must be joking, right? It's more like magic, I think.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:274

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Do you know who I am? I'm no ordinary alchemist.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:277

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"The mysterious stone you've all been looking for exists inside me. Because my blood itself is the very mystery you alchemists have been seeking.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:280

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Wow, sounds about right. You're awesome, Natsume-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:281

msgid "That's right. I could say Natsume-chan was known as one of the world's top alchemists."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:282

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"But you're not saying a piece of paper could turn into a monster, are you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:283

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Yes, I seriously mean it. It'll come out of Natsume space-time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:284

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Natsume space-time?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:285

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Natsume space-time is a convenient pocket dimension. So, I'll have this monster eat Hisae and then I'll be in the same class as Haruma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:286

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No, no, no! Hold on!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:287

msgid "I rushed to stop her. I wished I could see a real monster appear, but it would be too late by the time that happened, so I had to stop her now."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:290

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"I bet you'll make some great friends in your freshman class, so why don't you give it a try?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:291

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"She's right. You have to give new things a try.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:294

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Freshmen are childish. Being with them would wear me out.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:295

msgid "Well, Natsume-chan, you're rather childish too...\nBut I wouldn't say that to her face because she'd get cross with me again."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:296

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Why don't you at least go and give it a shot? And if you still don't like it, we'll take it from there. Don't dislike something without even having tried it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:299

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"O-okay. I'll try it once, but if I don't like it, I won't do it again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:300

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Well, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Come to the cafeteria at lunch time and let me know how it goes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:301

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"...Okay.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:305

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Ten minutes left, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:306

msgid "There was another ten minutes to go until lunch time. I think I did nothing but watch the clock since that morning."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:309

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Are you that worried about Natsume-chan? I think you're being overprotective of her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:310

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'm not worried about Natsume-chan. I'm worried about whether or not a monster is rampaging in her classroom.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:313

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Do what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:314

msgid "Natsume-chan was very clear about what she did and didn't like. I hope she's getting along well with her class. I doubt she's being bullied, but..."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:315

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Nine minutes to go? Is that clock stopped?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:318

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"It's moving. It's been exactly one minute. Come on, if you're a man, you'll settle down.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:319

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I know, but...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:321

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hm?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:324

msgid "I heard hasty footsteps coming from the hallway."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:325

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"What is it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:329

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Who's running out there? We're still in the middle of class.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:331

msgid "CLOMP-CLOMP-CLOMP!"
msgstr ""

#: 40404:332

msgid "The sound of footsteps came closer."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:333

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Haruma! Haruma!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:334

msgid "I heard the person who was running through the corridors. She was calling my name..."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:337

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Hey, Kazushi?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:338

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"S-sorry about that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:339

msgid "If I sat by the window, I would've jumped out without a second thought. However, I couldn't do that from the center of the classroom."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:341

msgid "I had to suck it up and endure being the focus of my classmates' attention for the moment."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:344

msgid "RATTLE!"
msgstr ""

#: 40404:345

msgid "The door opened sooner than I expected. A small-framed girl burst through the entrance."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:348

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Haruma! Listen! We baked cookies at home economics!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:349

msgid "Natsume-chan was swinging a parcel of paper napkins in her hand as she shamelessly rushed inside the classroom."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:353

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Amamiya, look here...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:354

msgid "Yagami-sensei rubbed his temple. I was getting a headache too."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:359

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"My class already finished, ten minutes early.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:360

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"And our class is still proceeding on schedule.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:361

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'm sorry about this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:364

msgid "{Lower-grade girl 1}\n\"Hey, Natsume!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:365

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hm?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:366

msgid "When I look carefully, I saw two girls calling for Natsume-chan. I wondered if they were Natsume-chan's classmates, but they looked younger than their age."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:367

msgid "They looked like they wanted to come in and stop Natsume-chan from interrupting our class, but they were stranded at the doorway."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:368

msgid "{Lower-grade girl 2}\n\"This is a second year classroom. This isn't good, Natsume.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:369

#: 40404:1822

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Yes, that is the stone which should have been sleeping under this island, lost together with that man. It is this island's black box of alchemy.\""

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Black box?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1824

msgid "{Principal}\n\"The reason the alchemy was so successful on this island is because of that stone.\""

#: 40404:1829

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"The stone inside Natsume was a fabrication of that stone. It is was merely a replica, and the one you see before you is the original.\""

#: 40404:1831

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I didn't know this stone was so special.\""

#: 40404:1832

msgid "{Principal}\n\"And I think that it's the source of power which keeps the world together over there.\""

#: 40404:1833

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"That means this world'll disappear if I break it, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1842

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I thought so.\""

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"You've been looking for the stone for years, haven't you? You stirred up such a great fuss over it today......\""

msgid "{Principal}\n\"It doesn't matter anymore. It probably is the only way that they can come back here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1892

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Besides, I feel like he wants this as well. Like he wants them to destroy that stone.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1893

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Umm, so is it okay to break it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1894

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Yes. Go ahead and damage it as much as you want.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1895

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"You can't change your mind later, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1898

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Of course I won't. I'm just not sure it's going to be that easy to destroy it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1899

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Do you think you can do it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1900

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Sure, we can.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1901

msgid "Surprisingly, Kazushi replied with confidence."

#: 40404:1902

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Do you know you're giving her a rash promise?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1903

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I feel like I can manage it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1904

msgid "Kazushi sounded like he had confidence. Hisae believed him, even though she didn't see any basis for his words."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1906

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Well, we're going to break it now. I think it might be best for you to stop the burner over there.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1909

msgid "{Amamiya}\n\"You're right, it may have some influence here otherwise. But you should know that once we disable the burner, we'll lose communication.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1910

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah, I know. We'll talk when we get home.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1911

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Well, take care of the rest, okay?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1921

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"We sure will. We'll be there, and you'll pay whatever compensation you owe us.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1923

msgid "Kazushi replied reliably. Hisae wore a slight smile on her face. She was certain they would do it."
msgstr ""

msgid "She wanted to believe that."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1926

msgid "As soon as our communication was blocked, the world fell silent."

#: 40404:1927

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Well, let's finish this up quickly and go home.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1930

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"How can you be so confident about this, Haruma?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1931

msgid "Natsume-chan couldn't figure out why I was acting so full of confidence - it must've looked weird to her."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1934

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"You made that rash promise with Hisae, but can you really destroy the stone? In case you didn't know, this is the greatest mystery created by alchemy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1935

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, that so? No wonder the principal seemed like she didn't want me to break it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1936

msgid "But I still didn't have a choice. Unless we destroyed the stone, we'd never destroy this world either."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1937

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I know I have to do it no matter what. And yes, that is my final answer.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1940

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"I agree with you. This place feels like a jail, and looks like a person I hate.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1941

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"A person you hate?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1944

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"That and this place makes me feel very sad.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1945

msgid "I knew what she was trying to say. This was a sad place - maybe that's why I wanted to destroy it."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1946

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Well, are you ready?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1947

msgid "We faced the stone at the same time. Before I knew it, Natsume-chan was holding her katana."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1949

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I still wonder why this thing exists.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1950

msgid "The stone's glow pulsed, as if it was breathing."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1953

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"All I know is that some alchemist created it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1954

msgid "She carefully stared at the stone."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1957

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"It's well made. It must have been synthesized by a famous alchemist, but why keep it hidden below the school?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1958

msgid "Based on her amazed look, Natsume-chan obviously thought the stone was invaluable."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1959

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I don't understand why that distinguished alchemist would create a sad world like this and not a happy one.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1962

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"It might've been different people who made the stone and then built this sad world.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1963

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1966

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"That's the feeling I get. This stone just brought somebody's dream to life.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1967

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1968

msgid "It could make dreams come true, so why would that person want to make such a sad world?"
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1969

msgid "He could be a very sad person like this world."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1972

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"If we utilize this carefully, it could make your dream come true, Haruma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1973

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No thanks.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1974

msgid "All I wanted was to go back to where I belonged with Natsume-chan. I didn't care about the stone, so long as I could achieve that."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1975

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What about you? If you want a dream to come true, why not ask it before we break it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1978

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"No thanks.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1979

msgid "Natsume-chan also shook her head, a slight smile on her face."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1980

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"I already have someone who can make my dream come true.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1981

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You do? Who?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1984

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"It's...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1985

msgid "Her cheeks blushed, and she closed her lips without continuing her words."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1986

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, come on! Don't leave me hanging.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1987

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"I'll tell you when we get home.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1988

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Okay.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1989

msgid "Then..."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1990

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Let's go home. To everyone!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1993

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Can we really make it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1994

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I think we'll be fine. Even in the worst case, we're together, aren't we? We can start our new life here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1995

msgid "If I was the only one to live here, it wasn't worth thinking about, but we'd be together, so it didn't sound all bad."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1996

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Yeah, I wouldn't be lonely if you were with me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1997

msgid "It would be great for us if we could go back, but if we couldn't make it, we'd still be okay together. It was an easy bet."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1998

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Well, we had so much cheerfulness before. I'm sure it'll be quieter with just the two of us.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:1999

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"So in the worst case scenario, we give birth and make more.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:2000

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? Give birth?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:2001

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Here we are, man and woman. That might very well be all we need.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:2002

msgid "The alchemy of fusing male and female elements to give birth to something new, huh?"
msgstr ""

#: 40404:2003

msgid "It's natural for men and women to do that."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:2004

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Okay! Then we'll give birth!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:2005

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"You idiot! That's only if we can't go back. Don't prioritize it!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:2006

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, that's right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:2007

msgid "I put my hand on hers, tightening her grip on the sword."
msgstr ""

#: 40404:2008

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"It's like cutting a wedding cake together.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:2009

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"It's our first joint deed. I know most married couples have done things like this all the time by the time they're wed.\""

msgstr ""

#: 40404:2013

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Can we break it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:2014

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Of course we can.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40404:2015

msgid "I hesitated no longer. For a moment, I saw ahead and glimpsed the stone already cut in half."
