msgstr ""

#: 20282:39
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

#: 20282:69
msgid "Rin seemed surprised."
msgstr ""

#: 20282:70
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 20282:83
msgid "Mizuki greeted me in a bad mood right off the bat. I planned to comfort her, but I was a little frightened by that frown. She looked so tired as she lay in bed."

#: 20282:91
msgid "I didn't have the slightest idea of what to do."
msgstr ""

#: 20282:92
msgid "In a situation like this I'm completely powerless. All I can do is watch and wait for instructions from Fujisaki-san."

#: 20282:96
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Maybe you should rub her back...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:97
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, okay.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:99
msgid "Just watching her pain was heartbreaking. I rushed over to sit next to her."

#: 20282:100
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 20282:101

"\"Simple touching can sometimes make a big difference. Maybe the human touch has some kind of magic power.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:110
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You think so?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:111

#: 20282:118
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What are you talking about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:123
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Why are you saying that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:124
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Because...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:125
msgid "Mizuki looked upset. Even the most trivial of things seem to get on her nerves right now. I knew from my sister that sickness could make one act like that."
msgstr ""

#: 20282:126
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Jeez, you worry about such crazy things. Even if you are bleeding, you're far cuter than her!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:129
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"You see, Mizuki? Haruma-kun doesn't care about anyone but you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:130
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 20282:132
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"The hell?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:133
msgid "I guess nothing's going to work with her now. I'll just have to smile and nod until it passes."
msgstr ""

#: 20282:136
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Th-then I'm gonna go now. I'll leave you two alone.\""

msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"You're so kind, Haruma-kun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:146
msgid "Rin muttered it so that only I could hear. I flushed a bit."
msgstr ""

#: 20282:147
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, anyone can get like this when they're sick. A little selfishness every once in a while is kind of cute.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:148
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Wow. You sound so mature.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:149
msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

"{Mizuki}\n"

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ow! Ow!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:160
msgid ""
"Mizuki pulled out some of my leg hairs!\n"
"I know what I said before, but right now I want to say Fujisaki-san's cuter than a foul-mood Mizuki!"
msgstr ""

#: 20282:164
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Mizuki-chan, enough.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:175
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"I know you're feeling sick, but if you're so difficult and give Haruma-kun too hard of a time then I'm going to have to steal him from you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:180
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"What!!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:181

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Uh, uh, uhhh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:183
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"...steal me from her? Fujisaki-san?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:184
msgid ""
"Does Fujisaki-san have feelings for me too...?\n"
"They say everybody blooms into love once in their life, and now's my time?"

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Uwahwah...uwahwah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:188
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Hey, don't get so serious. I'm just kidding - Haruma-kun's not actually my type.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:189
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:192
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"R-really? Whew...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:193
msgid "I knew it sounded too good to be true. I wouldn't know how to handle two girls at the same time anyways."
msgstr ""

#: 20282:196
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Okay, then I'm leaving. Take care. Oh, of Haruma-kun too, not just your body.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:198
msgid "Fujisaki-san winked at me and left the room."
msgstr ""

#: 20282:199

msgstr ""

#: 20282:203
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Urk...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:204
msgid "Shit. Without thinking about it I found myself looking at Rin's exit, which seemed to upset Mizuki."
msgstr ""

#: 20282:207
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Oh, sorry! Rin just chewed me out for this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:208
msgid "It seemed that Mizuki felt bad about complaining so much and she held her head in her hands."
msgstr ""

#: 20282:209
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't worry, Mizuki. It only comes once a month, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:212
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Ohh... Even though I'm so selfish... you're so kind, Kazushi.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:213
msgid "I noticed her eyes getting teary. Was she about to bawl? Was she?"
msgstr ""

#: 20282:214
msgid "Either way, it was kind of fun watching Mizuki's moods swing."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No sweat. It feels better, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:223
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Yes, it does. But no sex yet, okay?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:224
msgid "Her body twitched a bit as I touched it."

#: 20282:227
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't apologize for it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20282:228
msgid ""
"But the truth of the matter was that touching her body was enough to make my shaft start to grow.\n"
"For now, I'll just have to grin and bear it."
msgstr ""

#: 20282:229
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You can be a little selfish, you know?\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"That's fine. Also, I want...\""
