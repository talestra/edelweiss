"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Fourth grade? Then your parents were there, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02403:251
msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"A festival? Yeah, I can see how that'd happen.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02403:253
msgid "If they really got separated, it would've been hard to find each other. And being alone in that kind of crowd is frightening for a child."
msgstr ""

#: 02403:256
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I never felt so lonely in my entire life. No matter how hard I searched, I couldn't find them. I didn't know where they went, and there were people everywhere.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02403:257
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Even if I wanted to go back to the hotel, I didn't know how since we came by taxi. And I wasn't young enough to go crying to an adult for help either.\""

msgstr ""

#: 02403:266
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Yep.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02403:267
msgid "Her reason wasn't as drastic as I'd expected. It must have been a major event to Ran at the time though, especially for it to influence her personality this much."
msgstr ""

#: 02403:270
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I didn't want you to have to go through what I did on that day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02403:274
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Well, if you ever need a loan, just ask. I'll only charge 10% every 10 days.\""
