#: 50585:7
msgid "Our summer had nearly passed away. There were only a few more days before out hot summer came to an end."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"The breeze feels so good.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:10
msgid "Mei seemed to be getting more and more beautiful lately. She was nearly perfect."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:11
msgid "She doesn't have to become that beautiful. All I want is for her to be with me forever and ever, that's all."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:12
msgid "However, as she gets more beautiful, she keeps intriguing me even more."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:13
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"The sky is beautiful, isn't it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:14
msgid "Mei was the one that's beautiful. Her eyes were like beautiful lakes, and the sky reflected in them was several times more beautiful than the real sky above me."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:15
msgid "Maybe she was seeing this world a lot more beautifully than we do. Sometimes I couldn't help thinking that way."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:16
msgid "I even felt like her gaze was making the world beautiful. Perhaps whether something is beautiful or tainted is determined by the heart of the beholder."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:17
msgid "Mei's heart was certainly exceptionally beautiful. She was the greatest work God had created."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:18
msgid "It was almost like the deep, rich flow of time was polishing the ore that was Mei into a beautiful gem."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:19
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Your hand.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:20
msgid "The next thing I knew, her slender white hand was being held out to me. I took her hand and gently held it back."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:21
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hee-hee.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:22
msgid "Her small hand was entwined with mine. That innocent strength pulled me around behind her."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:23
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You'll fall if you run like that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:24
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Then we'll be together when we do.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:25
msgid "I felt like she was becoming more and more transparent as the days went by. She was so precious, and yet it was so heart-rending."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:26
msgid "We both knew these days wouldn't continue on for much longer."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:31
msgid "This was one of Mei's favorite places. By the time we'd had several dates, the place was filled with a carpet of white flowers."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:32
msgid "I loved looking up at her as I lay my head down on her lap in the middle of that field filled with the white flowers."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:33
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\".....................\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:34
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:35
msgid "She noticed my glance and asked me."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:36
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I was just looking at you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:37
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You're silly. Why don't you ever fall asleep? I'm letting you use my lap.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:38
msgid "She always seemed to complain about that. But it wasn't my fault - she was too beautiful for me to take my eyes off of her."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:39
msgid "I also felt like she might disappear the moment I looked away since she became more transparent every day."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:40
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What are you thinking about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:41
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hmm, tonight's dinner.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:42
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Ah, same as me, then.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:43
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? You were really thinking about dinner?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:44
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What do you mean? Did you lie about thinking about dinner?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:45
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, no. I feel like curry tonight.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:46
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Maybe curry with pork cutlet.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:47
msgid ""
"Mei sure ate well as usual. Maybe eating was keeping her in this world still.\n"
"......Heh, how nice that'd be."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:48
msgid "If that was the case, I would feed her a lot every single day and keep her here with me forever."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:49
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Tears......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:50
msgid "Mei wiped the corner of my eye. Her finger tip was wet."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:51
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm sleepy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:52
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Then why don't you fall asleep?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:53
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Kind of dozing off feels good.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:54
msgid "I closed my eyes, but I wasn't really sleepy."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:55
msgid "I only closed my eyes because it felt so nice and fluffy on Mei's lap. I really was just nodding off."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:56
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hee-hee...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:57
msgid ""
"Even with my eyes closed, I could tell Mei was looking down on me with a smile.\n"
"I wonder if she thinks I'm really asleep."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:58
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I think I was born to fall in love.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:59
msgid "She whispered to no one in particular. I felt a special meaning behind those words and opened my eyes. Just as I thought, she was looking down on me with a smile."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:60
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Did you remember something?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:61
msgid "Did she remember something about herself? I don't know why, but I just felt that way."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:62
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Once upon a time, there were two lovers who often came to this spot on a date.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:63
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Uh-huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:64
msgid "It didn't seem like it had anything to do with us. I didn't know what she was talking about, so I continued to listen."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:65
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"The two of them got along well and loved each other very much. Anyone who saw them could easily tell it was so. 'A human's 'love' is a very beautiful emotion,' she thought.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:66
msgid "That last line sounded like it was Mei's own opinion, but this was supposed to be a fairy tale."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:67
msgid "I couldn't see where Mei was going with this yet."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:68
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"'I want to know this beautiful emotion. I want to experience it,' she thought.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:69
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You did?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:70
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Who knows? ...I wonder who she is?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:71
msgid "She giggled. Well, I guess it doesn't matter. Maybe it's one of those made up stories."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:72
msgid "Mei continued."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:73
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"After that, a lot of things happened. She witnessed suffering and hardship. But still, her admiration towards the feeling of 'love' only grew stronger.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:74
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Many days and many months passed, then finally her chance came. It was her chance to experience 'love'.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:75
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"And the one who gave her that chance, the one who led her to admire love, was herself.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:76
msgid "Mei paused there and smiled."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:77
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"That's how the fairy tale goes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:78
msgid "That was the ending."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:79
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see, it's just a fairy tale.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:80
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Yep, just a fairy tale. I looked into lots of them.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:81
msgid "I really wasn't interested in finding out if what she was telling was merely a fairy tale or if it was suggesting some kind of truth."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:82
msgid "But every single word that came from Mei was more precious to me than anything else. I wasn't going to miss even a single word from her."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:83
msgid "So I always listened to her very carefully."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:84
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Then she fell in love.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:85
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see. Then did she find out what it's like to be in love?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:86
msgid "That's what Mei wanted to know. That's what I promised her I would let her experience."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:87
msgid "Mei thought for a moment and then smiled mischievously."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:89
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's a secret.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:90
msgid "Her radiant smile almost made me cry. So, Mei's prediction was right."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:91
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:92
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Yes. Thank you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:94
msgid "She brought her face close and over mine, gently pecking me on my lips. They barely touched, but it was incredible kiss."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:95
msgid "I probably will never feel such an impressionable kiss ever again in my life."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:97
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Can I ask you one final favor?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:98
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Of course.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:99
msgid "I gave her an immediate reply. I will do whatever she wants me to do right now."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:100
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I wasn't really Ibuki Mei-san, was I?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:101
msgid "Mei was never Ibuki Mei-san. She was an artificial existence, made to look like Ibuki Mei."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:102
msgid "The experiment to revive Ibuki Mei ended in failure, and gave birth to Mei."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:103
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I've already grown used to it, but isn't it a little strange to give someone else's name when naming yourself? So, I want a new name.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:104
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"A new name?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:105
msgid "I had no idea that her favor was something that humble."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:106
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You want me to name you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:107
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Yes, I want you to name me, Kazushi-kun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:108
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see. Then I'll have to give you a good name.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:109
msgid "What would be good? It's hard to come up with something nice all of a sudden."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:110
msgid "Shouldn't I really look into things like stroke counts and stuff?"
msgstr ""

#: 50585:111
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Can that be homework?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:112
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"No. I want it now, because...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:113
msgid "She started to say something and stopped, but I knew what she was going to say. She might not have another chance."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:114
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Okay, then I need to give you one now, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:115
msgid "I thought seriously. What would be a good name for Mei?"
msgstr ""

#: 50585:116
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I wonder what you will come up with?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:117
msgid "She looked at me with such anticipation I felt pressured."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:118
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, first off, the last name can be Haruma, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:119
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What? That's cutting corners!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:120
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"We'll have the same last name eventually, so why not?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:121
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"That's kind of high-handed. Oh, well. Then my first name?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:122
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Your first name, let's see...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:123
msgid "The first name is the challenge. Right now, it's Mei........."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:124
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, I know!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:125
msgid "I came up with something. I told it to Mei."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:126
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Ok, I like that!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:127
msgid "Mei nodded as if she really liked it. Then she repeated the name many times to herself, savoring it."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:128
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Thank you, I will treasure it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:132
msgid "Our summer break was over and the second semester started. There were little changes from before."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:136
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"My name is Aozora, and starting this semester, I will be in charge of this class. I know this change has come in the middle of the year, but I hope we can all get along well.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:139
msgid "The principal was in charge of us now. It had been decades since she last taught, but I imagine the events with Mei had an influence on her."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:142
msgid "The library no longer has a bibliosoph. Instead, we have students in charge of it."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:143
msgid "I volunteered myself to be one."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:146
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hmm, I see.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:147
msgid "Even now, I still research this island's folklore from time to time."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:149
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, this is...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:150
msgid "There was one folktale amongst them that especially caught my eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:151
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"The Legend of Eiden Island's Goddess...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:152
msgid "Long ago, Eiden Island was regarded as sacred and believed to be the island where a goddess of unparalleled beauty resided."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:153
msgid "She was once a human who was courted by countless men for her great beauty, yet she refused to marry any of them, and was turned into a goddess."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:154
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What a strange story... But was she really that beautiful? Well, I'm sure Mei is even more beautiful.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:155
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Right, Mei?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:156
msgid "I whispered her name, thinking she might suddenly appear if I called her."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:157
msgid "....................."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:158
msgid "Of course, there was no reply."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:161
msgid "Since then, the flowed bed has been in constant bloom. It wasn't long before autumn would really start setting in, but this one place continued to look like spring."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:162
msgid "I lay down, burying myself in the flowers and looking up at the sky."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:164
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wow, such a vast, clear sky.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:165
msgid "It's still hot most days, but the sky was definitely an autumn sky."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:166
msgid "Autumn came, winter came, and then spring and summer came again. Whenever I thought about the natural changing of seasons, my mind drifted afar."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:167
msgid "How many seasons will I have to spend without Mei from now on?"
msgstr ""

#: 50585:168
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"This is tough.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50585:169
msgid ""
"Mei is no longer here.\n"
"The person I loved the most is no longer anywhere.\n"
"That's the reality of it."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:170
msgid "As time goes by, the feeling of loss seems to weigh even heavier on me. Sometimes I feel like the weight of that reality will crush me."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:171
msgid "But I don't want to go back and redo things. It may have only been a short time, but I can say with confidence that we were truly happy."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:172
msgid "I will never forget the time we spent together. The memories from those days will radiantly live forever in my heart."
msgstr ""

#: 50585:173
