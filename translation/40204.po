"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"All right! He's open today.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:8
msgid "I'm glad I woke up early and gathered all the change I could find."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:9
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hello.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:10
msgid "I called out as I entered the store, and Miya-san came out from the back."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:13
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Oh, Haruma-kun. Welcome.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:14
msgid "He was always in the back room. Maybe he didn't want to work too hard."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:15
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm looking for some chopsticks and a rice bowl. Also, do you have any tea cups?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:16
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Yeah, of course. So, you decided to get your own dinnerware? I thought the guys like you didn't care.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:17
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's not for me...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:18
msgid "But then I stopped talking. It was kind of embarrassing to admit that I was actually buying them for a girl."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:21
msgid "Miya-san smiled kindly."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:22
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Mhmm, so you're getting them for a girl, then?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:23
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Woah!? You read my mind!! Do you have ESP?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:24
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"I could tell by looking at your face. I have a lot of feminine items in stock. Most of the customers here are girls, you know?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:25
msgid "Miya-san led me to the back. There, I saw a section filled with household items, like chopsticks, cups, and dishes."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:26
msgid "Like Miya-san said, it was almost entirely girly stuff."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:29
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"What kind of girl is she? What kind of design would she like?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:30
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:31
msgid "I thought about Natsume-chan. What would she like?"
msgstr ""

#: 40204:32
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"She looks rather small and cute, so maybe this fancy stuff would suit her?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:33
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Then again, she is a bit strange. Maybe she has unusual taste too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:36
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"In other words, she's younger than you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:37
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Uhh, yeah. Oh, you know, it's that new girl. Amamiya Natsume-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:42
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"O-oh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:43
msgid "Miya-san's expression grew dark the instant I mentioned her name."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:44
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Umm, is there something wrong with Natsume-chan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:47
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"No... I just haven't seen her yet, so I don't really know what she's like.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:48
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:49
msgid "It sounded like he was panicking to make something up. Something was fishy."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:50
msgid "I'd remembered what I heard yesterday. The grocer said that the girl who came to look for her father looked just like Natsume-chan."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:51
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Did you know Natsume-chan, Miya-san?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:52
msgid "That was the feeling I got. He seemed like he knew her, but was hiding it."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:55
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"No, I haven't seen her yet. She just got here, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:56
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's what I thought, but I wasn't sure. The man at the grocery store said he saw someone just like her a few years ago.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:57
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Do you know anything about that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:58
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Don't think so. I'm not the type who gets out much. I don't think I've heard of it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:59
msgid "He has to know something. I can feel it."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:60
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is that so? So you don't know anything?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:61
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Unfortunately not.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:62
msgid "He knew, but wasn't going to talk. That's the impression I got. Maybe he wasn't out yesterday? I was with Nastume-chan yesterday, so..."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:63
msgid "Am I over-thinking this? But I just can't shake my doubts."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:66
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"I don't know about her, but I'll give you a piece of advice.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:67
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Some advice?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:68
msgid "Miya-san's tone changed. It didn't sound like the usual kindly shopkeeper."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:69
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"I don't think you should get too close to that girl, Amamiya Natsume.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:70
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:71
msgid "What kind of advice was that? He said he didn't know her, but then he said that?"
msgstr ""

#: 40204:72
msgid "It sounded like he knew her very well from the statement he just made. Why would he say I shouldn't get involved with her if he didn't know her?"
msgstr ""

#: 40204:73
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Miya-san, you do know about Natsume-chan, don't you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:76
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Who knows.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:77
msgid "He just shook his head, refusing to give me an answer. But the way he didn't answer seemed like an answer in itself."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:78
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"......\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:79
msgid "Miya-san didn't say anything; he just looked at the dinnerware in the store. Then he grabbed a set."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:82
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"I think you should get this one if you're giving it to her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:83
msgid "It was a set with cute cat designs on it."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:84
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Why did you pick that one?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:87
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"......\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:88
msgid "But he didn't say anything at all. I wondered why he looked so lonely as he held his silence."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:89
msgid "That was why I couldn't ask him anymore."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:94
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It sure is weird.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:95
msgid "I did get the gift for Natsume-chan, but I didn't feel right about it. I just couldn't understand."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:96
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm so sure Miya-san knows something about Natsume-chan, so why's he acting like he doesn't know her?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:97
msgid "But why does he know her? Who is Natsume-chan?"
msgstr ""

#: 40204:98
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I don't know a thing about her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:99
msgid "Where did she come from - and why did she appear like that?"
msgstr ""

#: 40204:100
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I can find out about all that later. In the meantime, I should give this to her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:105
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Have you seen Natsume-chan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:106
msgid "I brought the gift to the cafeteria, but I couldn't find Natsume-chan."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:111
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Hmm, she doesn't seem to be around.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:114
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Maybe she's asleep? You know, overdoing her nap or something.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:118
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"That's so cute. Do you think she has her belly out?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:122
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Shouldn't we go and wake her up? I'll go, and assault her while I'm at it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:124
msgid "Thock!"
msgstr ""

#: 40204:127
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Ouch!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:128
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't assault her. You're dangerous.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:132
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Maybe you should wait a while?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:133
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I guess...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:136
msgid "........."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:137
msgid "..."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:138
msgid "But Natsume-chan didn't even show up for dinner."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:143
msgid "I went over to the girls' dorm to find out."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:144
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is she asleep?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:145
msgid "There weren't any lights on in her room. Could she not be feeling well? It was a hot day today, so maybe she's dehydrated?"
msgstr ""

#: 40204:148
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Huh? Kazushi-kun?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:149
msgid "Haruka came over. She had an ice cream in her mouth, and her hair was wet. It appeared that she just came back from the bath."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:150
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey. Just finished your bath?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:151
msgid "Haruka smiled, her smooth skin like a clean, boiled egg."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:154
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Ice cream tastes best right after a bath. I love summer.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:155
msgid "She liked the summer because of the ice cream... That was so like Haruka, but I didn't feel like chatting."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:156
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, have you seen Natsume-chan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:159
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Natsume-chan? No. I haven't seen her. What happened?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:160
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"She didn't come to dinner, and the lights are off in her room.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:163
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Huh? She didn't eat dinner? But she's a growing girl.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:164
msgid "She looked up at Natsume-chan's room, worried. The curtains were open, but the room was too dark to see inside of it."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:167
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Well, I'll go to her room, and see what's going on. Hold this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:171
msgid "She made me hold her ice cream, and ran."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:172
msgid "A couple minutes later, the lights went on in Natsume-chan's room. The window opened, and Haruka looked out from it."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:173
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"She's not here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:174
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No? Is she in the bathroom?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:175
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I don't know. Let me check.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:176
msgid "Haruka disappeared."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:178
msgid "Another couple minutes, and Haruka came out from the main entrance."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:182
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"She's not there, either. I don't think she's in the dorm.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:183
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I wonder where she went, skipping dinner like that...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:184
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I don't know. When do you think she disappeared?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:185
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I haven't seen her since this morning. I was off campus and all.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:186
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Let's look around, then.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:187
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"OK...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:194
msgid "CRASH!!"
msgstr ""

#: 40204:195
msgid "Suddenly, we heard the shrill sound of something breaking, and stopped."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:196
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"What was that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:197
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It sounded like a window breaking. Where is it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:200
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Over there, I think!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:201
msgid "We turned around. It was coming from the school building."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:202
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Let's go!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:203
msgid "I had a bad feeling."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:208
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Where is it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:210
msgid "CRASH!!"
msgstr ""

#: 40204:211
msgid "That noise again. This time, it was closer."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:214
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Over there!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:215
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is it in the lab?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:220
msgid "The lab was deadly silent."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:221
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Did it really come from here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:222
msgid "It was really quiet - perhaps I could say it was too quiet."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:225
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"What is this... The air feels tight.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:226
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"The air?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:227
msgid "I waved my hand through the air around me. It didn't seem to be any different than usual to me."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:230
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I'm sure there's someone in here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:231
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is it Natsume-chan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:234
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I don't know. But they might not be alone.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:235
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"How many people?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:236
msgid "There were a few people inside. And they were doing something to break the windows? Was Natsume-chan in trouble?"
msgstr ""

#: 40204:239
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Do you want to go in?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:240
msgid "In other words, she was telling me it could get dangerous."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:241
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Shouldn't you wait here, Haruka?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:242
msgid "I didn't want her to get involved in anything dangerous. But Haruka laughed it off."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:245
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"You're ten years too early to worry about me, Kazushi-kun. Alright, let's go in together.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:249
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's so dark...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:250
msgid "The lab was pitch black inside, like the darkest night. The curtains were open, but it seemed like the light from outside was shut out for some reason."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:251
msgid "It was too dark to see."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:254
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"There's someone here...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:256
msgid "Haruka sounded nervous. I tried to see as hard as I could. Then, I saw a person's small figure in the dark."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:257
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Natsume-chan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:260
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Haruka and Haruma-kun, is it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:261
msgid "That wasn't Natsume-chan's voice, but rather the principal's."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:265
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I thought it was you, grandma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:266
msgid "Haruka sounded like she knew what was going on. I relaxed a bit and set foot inside. We could finally see as our eyes grew accustomed to the darkness."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:269
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Ah!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:270
msgid "Haruka found it little bit faster than I did. I was looking at it as she made a sound."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:272
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wha...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:273
msgid "I couldn't believe what I was looking at. Natsume-chan was on the floor, and we immediately knew why."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:274
msgid "Something like a knife was plunged into her chest. It wasn't in very deep, but the blade shone with the cold light of the moon."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:275
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Natsume-chan?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:276
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Wh-why?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:277
msgid "It was like we were in a dream. Nothing seemed real to me - maybe a dream would have been more real."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:278
msgid "But you don't think you're dreaming when you are."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:279
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"What happened? Grandma!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:280
msgid "Haruka yelled out. Natsume-chan moved a little, as if trying to respond."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:281
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Natsume-chan!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:282
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Mm...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:283
msgid "We stood there, motionless, like time was frozen, but we started to move as soon as Natsume-chan made some noise."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:284
msgid "We ran over to Natsume-chan and she looked at me with her big round eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:285
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Haruma...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:286
msgid "It looked painful, but it didn't seem real. Maybe because Natsume-chan wasn't acting like it hurt her."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:287
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hold on. I'll get that knife out of you...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:288
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"I don't care about that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:289
msgid "She said, and grabbed my arm. I was surprised by how powerful her grip was."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:290
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Haruma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:291
msgid "She looked up at me. I couldn't move, as I felt like I was sucked into her huge eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:292
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"We need to do something about this...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:293
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"No. Stay here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:294
msgid "She grabbed my arm harder."

msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"It's all just a waste. I don't have anything as I am now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:296
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:297
msgid "Natsume-chan moved her eyes. She was looking at the principal, who just stood there without saying anything."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:298
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"What? What are you talking about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:299
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Principal. What is the meaning to all of this?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:300
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Fear not. She is neither injured, nor will she die. After all, she isn't human.\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:301
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:302
msgid "Natsume-chan isn't human? What do you mean?"
msgstr ""

#: 40204:303
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"What do you mean she's not human?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:304
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Haruma...\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:305
msgid "The hand grabbed me a little more tightly, and I looked at her."
msgstr ""

#: 40204:306
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 40204:307
msgid "I was taken aback as I looked at her. It seemed as if Natsume-chan was vanishing into the darkness."
msgstr ""
