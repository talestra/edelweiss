msgid "A sturdy lock came undone with a click."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:10

msgid "{Ran}\n\"No one's here, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:11

msgid "Ran glanced left and right before quickly opening the door."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:12

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Come on, let's go.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:13

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Okay.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:18

msgid "It felt strange being in the laboratory during our break."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:21

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Here we are! No one saw us, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:23

msgid "Ran put down her stuff and exhaled slowly."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:24

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I don't think anyone saw us. But why did we have to sneak in here? You have permission to use this room, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:27

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Didn't work out.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:28

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What? It didn't? Why not?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:29

msgid "We were just trying to do our homework. Why wouldn't they give us permission?"
msgstr ""

#: 30303:32

msgid "{Ran}\n\"They were worried about us doing it alone and Mei-chan said she was going to supervise us. We ARE the failure combo.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:33

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Okay... What's wrong with that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:34

msgid "I was uneasy doing it by ourselves, but if Mei-sensei was going to help us, then what more could we ask for?"
msgstr ""

#: 30303:37

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What are you saying? We can't let Mei-chan see what we're about to do, can we?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:38

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? What are we about to do?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:39

msgid "What are you planning that you can't show sensei?"
msgstr ""

#: 30303:42

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Well, that's how it is, so I stole the key to this room today. If they catch us, you're my accomplice, so have fun!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:43

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hey?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:44

msgid "I was planning to do our summer homework like good students, but there were dangerous clouds on the horizon."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:47

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What are you afraid of? You've got a pair, don't you? We'll be fine. Oh, set our stuff down over there.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:48

msgid "True, it was too late to complain now. I set our hug bag of stuff we just bought at Miya-san's store down to the side."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:49

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Starting today, this is going to be our home for a while. Let's work together.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:51

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Do you really think we can sleep over and perform experiments without permission? Besides, think about it, it may be our homework, but we're talking about a guy and a girl sharing the same room by themselves.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:53

msgid "It was gonna be on my mind the whole time."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:54

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What are you saying now? We've already gone and done it, so what does it matter if we sleep together?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:55

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah... You're right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:56

msgid "She was so candid. Are all women like that after you fuck them for the first time? I thought there'd be more mood and romance..."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:59

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Well, now we just need to try not to get caught.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:60

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:61

msgid "I'd already caused a lot of problems before, so I might really be in trouble if there's more."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:62

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Well, we'll be fine. No one's coming here during break. This is a studio too, so we have everything we need to get by.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:63

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Well, we've come this far. We just have to do it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:64

msgid "{Ran}\n\"You got it. Okay, we'll be together for a while.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:65

msgid "And so we began living together."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:69

msgid "By the time we were done sorting our luggage and lit the fire, it was already noon. We were using the big furnace built into the room, not the burners we used in class."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:70

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Now this looks like a serious experiment.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:73

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Of course, it is. You got to make it look good first. 'If you build it, they will come.' You know?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:74

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Looks come first, right? I remember when I first tried to do snowboarding, I bought the whole set of snowboarding gear.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:75

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"But I regretted it since I only used it once.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:78

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Ahaha, that's a bad example. You tried to pick up chicks with it, but couldn't reel any in so you quit, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:79

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"How do you know?! Were you watching me?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:81

msgid "I went last year with Appo and the others, but it was a disaster. I was so embarrassed when I fell down trying to get on the lift, stopping the whole, packed thing."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:82

msgid "Then I wandered onto the expert course and couldn't get down the mountain."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:83

msgid "Halfway down, I nearly got lost and had the rescue squad come find me, some tranny tried to seduce Appo in the sauna, and nothing good happened."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:86

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I know exactly how you tend to act. More importantly, why don't we take this time to eat something?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:87

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You're brushing it off, but all that kit was expensive.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:89

msgid "The slopes'll make any girl look cute, but I learned the hard way that it wasn't the same for guys."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:90

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Kazushi, you want two eggs?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:91

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Eggs?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:92

msgid "I came out of my reverie as I heard Ran from afar. She wasn't in the room anymore, but next door in the prep room. A nice smell was wafting out."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:93

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? Are you cooking something?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:94

msgid "There was a kitchen in the room next door. As Ran said earlier, there were facilities available for people to stay overnight."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:95

msgid "I looked in and saw Ran shaking a frying pan as she made something."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:96

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What, you really can cook?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:99

msgid "{Ran}\n\"You can't really call this cooking. I wanted to give you some energy though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:100

msgid "What an admirable statement. I didn't know Ran even had a domestic side to her."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:101

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"It's a nice looking view, too...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:102

msgid "Is this what they call \"an image gap?\" She looked damn cute holding a pan in the kitchen."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:103

msgid "What if I hugged her now?"
msgstr ""

#: 30303:107

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Ohh, be careful. You're so impatient!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:109

msgid "I wonder if she'd say sweet things like that?"
msgstr ""

#: 30303:112

msgid "{Ran}\n\"He's spacing out. Now's my chance!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:113

msgid "Shake, shake!"
msgstr ""

#: 30303:114

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hmm?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:115

msgid "I just saw Ran doing something suspicious."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:116

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hey, did you just sneak something in there?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:119

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What? No. Look, you're gonna become super strong when you eat this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:120

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, yeah! I can't wait for your homemade food!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:121

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I am almost done. Just wait for a second.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:122

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Wow. What a great smell!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:123

msgid "The smell was arousing my appetite. Was that her hidden flavor she put in? This looks like it'll taste good too."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:128

msgid "In the beginning, all was well."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:129

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"This tastes really good, Ran.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:132

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Good, good! Eat more, Kazushi.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:133

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"All right! More please!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:134

msgid "Ran's home cooking tasted just great. It was unique and homely."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:135

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh yeah, don't people sometimes say 'Alchemy is like cooking'?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:138

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I have heard that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:139

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"If so, you must be good at alchemy, Ran, because you are a good cook.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:140

msgid "{Ran}\n\"No, I don't think so. There's a fundamental difference between cooking and alchemy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:141

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Really? Well, it's not like I know whether they're similar or not.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:144

msgid "{Ran}\n\"When it comes to alchemy, you're a lot better than me, Kazushi. I'm counting on you for this experiment.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:145

msgid "We simply chatted, enjoying the food, but..."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:148

msgid "I wonder when I finally noticed something was strange?"
msgstr ""

#: 30303:149

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"It's getting hot in here...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:150

msgid "By the time I noticed it, I was deadly hot. My body felt like it was on fire, and my vision was blurred."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:153

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Yeah. And also...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:154

msgid "Her face was becoming red. She must have been feeling hot too."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:155

msgid "{Ran}\n\"My heart is pounding so fast.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:156

msgid "Ran breathed heavily. Was she having a difficulty breathing? At the same time, she turned her watery, glittering eyes to me."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:157

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hey, is something weird going on here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:160

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Hmm... Yeah... Very weird. Why is this happening to me too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:161

msgid "She said something odd."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:162

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Me too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:163

msgid "That sounded like she was planning for only me to act weird? Th-that's not true."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:164

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No, that can't be... Hmm?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:165

msgid "Hey, something really is weird. Yes, something is weird."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:168

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Huh? Huh? Huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:169

msgid "What is this? I can hear Kazushi's thoughts in my head but Ran's thoughts are in my head..."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:170

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What is this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:171

msgid "{Ran}\n\"No idea. I just put a stimulant in your dish.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:172

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"A stimulant?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:173

msgid "No wonder I feel like I'm burning up. Why did you put that kind of stuff in there?"
msgstr ""

#: 30303:174

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I just borrowed it from the school drug stores... But why am I affected as well?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:175

msgid "Ran took a look at the drug's container and reads its description."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:178

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Oh... this works even by smell...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:179

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"The smell? This sweet smell?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:180

msgid "I thought the smell was appetizing, but I guess it was the stimulant's smell. And my appetite for food wasn't the only one it stimulated."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:181

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Ugh, me too... what am I going to do with this pent up lust?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:182

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Lust? ...That's graphic.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:183

msgid "You're wriggling your crotch. Hey, am I really hard already?!"
msgstr ""

#: 30303:184

msgid "{Ran}\n\"That's pretty graphic too. It makes me feel more...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:185

msgid "Ran looked down at her legs. I saw something shiny run down in the inner side of her thigh."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:186

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? What's that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:189

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I'm so wet...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:190

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? Really? You're that wet?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:191

msgid "She was so wet it was dripping down to her knees? Her clear love juice kept flowing out."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:192

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Wow...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:193

msgid "{Ran}\n\"You too, Kazushi...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:194

msgid "Her eyes full of tears, Ran stared at the bulge in my crotch."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:195

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Wow!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:196

msgid "My crotch was going wild too. I was so hard, it looked like I'd shoved a wooden stick down my pants."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:197

msgid "I can't believe I didn't even notice until now."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:200

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Kazushi, it looks so hard on you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:201

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You too, Ran.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:202

msgid "Both of us were like burning with fever."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:203

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Can we do it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:204

msgid "I pressed Ran against me and she buried her face into my chest."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:207

msgid "{Ran}\n\"H-hey, wait.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:208

msgid "She hit the brakes on me."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:209

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What is this? I'm about to explode.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:212

msgid "{Ran}\n\"How much do you have right now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:213

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Are you charging for this?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:214

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Of course! I don't care how close we are, the line has to stay drawn!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:215

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"And that line is money?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:216

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Don't you want to do it now? If you don't, I don't care...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:217

msgid "Ran trembled in a way that was incompatible with her words. At least her body was pretty honest."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:218

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You don't care? Doesn't look that way at all. You wanna do it so bad, don't you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:221

msgid "{Ran}\n\"That's right! Hurry up and give me some money! Hurry!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:222

msgid "She was desperately demanding money. I could no longer fight back against my feelings - I wanted to fuck her right away!!"
msgstr ""

#: 30303:223

msgid "I had no choice. I fumbled in my pockets for my wallet."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:224

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Shit! I forgot my wallet!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:227

msgid "{Ran}\n\"IDIOT!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:228

msgid "Ran blew her top."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:229

msgid "{Ran}\n\"How could you forget it at such an important time?! Forgetting your wallet is like saying 'please kill me now'!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:230

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What are you...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:233

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Don't you have anything?! There's no spare change in your pockets?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:234

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Uh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:236

msgid "I turned my pockets inside out and got dust. I took my pants off, flipped them upside down, and shook them."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:237

msgid "Cling..."
msgstr ""

#: 30303:238

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Ahh!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:239

msgid "{Ran}\n\"You have some?! How much?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:240

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"50 yen!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30303:241

msgid "{Ran}\n\"That's good enough for now! Jam it in!!\""
