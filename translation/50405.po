"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I had no idea I was so diligent.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:9
msgid "I was impressed with myself. To be honest, \"I want to get laid\" has probably been the biggest sentiment behind my loves before. Maybe I wasn't thinking about my partner."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, I'm so mature. Mentally and physically, I've matured.\""

"{Mei}\n"

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50405:43
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Because I wore you out.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:46
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh......... No, that was my pleasure.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:48

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hee-hee, how silly.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:61
msgid "For once I was really getting into reading. It was because sensei was working on something and I had grown kind of interested in this island's folktales."

#: 50405:62
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:63

msgstr ""

#: 50405:67
msgid "When I looked up, my eyes and Mei-sensei's eyes met. She looked away in a hurry."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50405:75
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"No, not really.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:77
msgid "I don't know how many times we repeated this conversation. I felt her glancing at me all day long - whenever I faced her, she was looking at me."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:78
msgid "But she looked away when our eyes met. Then, after a while, I would sense her looking at me. When I looked up, our eyes would meet."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:79
msgid "And she would look away again. ...Over and over."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:82
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"........................\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:83
msgid "She was looking at her notebook, but her pen wasn't moving at all. From what I could see, I don't think she was getting anything done."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:84
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, sensei.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:87
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Huh? What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:88
msgid "She jumped and looked up. Her face was a little red, and her eyes were moist."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:89
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sensei, are you feeling OK?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:90
msgid "I wonder if her face was red from a fever?"
msgstr ""

#: 50405:93
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Feeling? Am I?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:94
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I've never been sick before......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:96
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:97
msgid "They say that the beautiful die young, so I just assumed sensei would be weak, but I guess she was so healthy she never caught a cold."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:98
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Then I guess you wouldn't know. Your face is red, and you seem a little sluggish.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:101
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Yeah... my heart's beating fast too...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:102
msgid "She put her hand over her chest and gave a big sigh."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:105
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"And I feel kind of choked up.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:106
msgid "She looked up at me with moist eyes. It looked kind of sexy to me, and made my heart pound."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:107
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sensei, don't you think that might be...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:108
msgid "Could sensei's response be love? We did cross that line, so it wouldn't be odd at all for her to understand love by now, right?"
msgstr ""

#: 50405:109
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I think that might be...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:112
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hnng...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:117
msgid "Sensei clutched her chest and fell out of her chair and onto the floor. She clutched it as if in great pain and curled up on the floor."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:118
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, I guess it's not love......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:119
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hnng...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:120
msgid "She sounded like she was in agony. So she wasn't feeling well!"
msgstr ""

#: 50405:121
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sensei!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:122
msgid "I felt like kicking myself for getting excited like an idiot. I can't believe I ignored her illness for such stupid things."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:123
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Nnngh... Kazushi-kun...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:124
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm right here! Wait, I'm taking you to the nurse's office right now!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:129
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Sorry to make you worry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:130
msgid "Sensei calmed down after she rested for awhile at the nurse's office."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:131
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't worry about that. How are you feeling? Are you OK?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:134
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Yeah, I feel much better.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:135
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm glad. Man, you sure scared me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:136
msgid "She really did scare me. I never thought she would collapse."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:137
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"But I'm glad I was with you. You held me like a princess!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:138
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't get so excited over that. I can do it as much as you want when you're better.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:141
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Really? Hooray!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:142
msgid "Sensei was as happy as a little girl. She did look like she would be okay now. Her complexion was a lot better."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:143
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Have you ever collapsed like that before?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:146
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"No, never. This was the first time. My chest felt so tight all of a sudden. I wonder what it was...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:147
msgid "This must be the first time something like this happened to her. Sensei looked worried."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:148
msgid "Of course, I was worried too. Since her chest hurt, it didn't look like it could be anemia."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:149
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It might be best for you to go to the hospital and have them take a look.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:152
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Yes, you're right. I don't think it's anything serious, though. I'm perfectly fine now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:153
msgid "She did look like she was really alright, and her smile wasn't lying either. Still, seeing as it was her chest, I was worried."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:154
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I'll see how I feel, and if I still don't feel right, I'll go to the clinic.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:155
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You should. That would make me feel better too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:158
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I'm so sorry to have worried you. But really, I wonder what it was...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:159
msgid "I wonder too. I just hope it's nothing serious."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:164
msgid "The next day, sensei never came to the library."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:165
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What? A fever?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:168
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Yeah, that's what she said. Sensei asked me to come tell you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:169
msgid "I went to the library as usual, but sensei wasn't there. As I was waiting for her, Fujisaki-san showed up and told me sensei was in bed with a fever."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:170
msgid "Because of what happened yesterday, I got worried."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:171
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I wonder if her fever's from a cold?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:172
msgid "Yesterday it was chest pain. Today it's a fever. I wonder if it's really just a cold........."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:175
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"It's worrisome, isn't it? Why don't you go pay her a visit?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:176
msgid "Of course I wanted to if I could."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:177
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But do you think it'll be OK? It's the girls' dorm.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:180
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"You're visiting her because she's sick, so I think it will be. I'll come with you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:181
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Really? I would really appreciate it if you could.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:182
msgid "I hope she's OK... I hope she isn't suffering......"
msgstr ""

#: 50405:188
msgid "....................."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:189
msgid "There wasn't any answer when I knocked on her door."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:192
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Maybe she's asleep?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:194
msgid "Fujisaki-san turned the doorknob. It was unlocked, and the door opened a crack."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:195
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Mei-sensei. It's me, Fujisaki. How are you feeling?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:197
msgid "We opened the door slightly and looked in."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:200
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Huh? She's not here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:201
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"She's not? I thought she was sick in bed.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:202
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Yes, she was.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:203
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Intruder Alert!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:204
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ah!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:211
msgid "I jumped for a second, but Fuusen was smiling. She was teasing me."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:212
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't scare me!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:215
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"What are you doing in here, Haruma-kun? If you're trying to go night crawling this early in the morning, you're more forward than Appo!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:216
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Appo comes sneaking in here at night?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:219
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Quite often.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:220
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Huh? No way... I'm scared...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:221
msgid "Yeah, the thought of Appo sneaking into the girls' dorm night after night was scary."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:224
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Anyway, what are you really doing here? Oh, visiting Mei-chan, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:225
msgid "I guess she just realized we were standing in front of Mei-sensei's room. She must have known she was sick in bed."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:228
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"But I think Mei-chan just went to the clinic?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:231
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Oh, really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:232
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"The clinic?\n"
"......She hasn't gotten any worse, has she?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:233
msgid "I was really worried. I was surprised myself at how panicked I became just from hearing sensei had gone to the clinic."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:234
msgid "Fuusen read my worries and nodded at me."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:237
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"When you're in love, you feel everything ten times more strongly than before. It doesn't matter if it's joy or fear.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:240
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Fretting over it is worse than giving birth. When you go to push it out it can turn out to be nothing more than an imaginary pregnancy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:243
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Don't you think that example isn't very appropriate?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:244
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I kind of do get what she's trying to say. Well, I'll just head over to the clinic.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:247
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Why don't you? When you don't feel well, having someone who loves you nearby really does make you feel better.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:248
msgid "Fuusen smiled at me sweetly. Her face nearly made me crack up, but her thoughtfulness was genuinely appreciated."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:251
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Rin, why don't you go with him to the clinic? He might not feel comfortable going by himself.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:254
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Oh, yes, sure. Shall we go, then?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:255
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50405:264
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sensei, are you okay?\n"
".........Ah.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:268
msgid "I found the principal at her bedside. She shot me a look with her beady eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:273
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Oh, Principal, hello.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:274
msgid "Fujisaki-san quickly greeted the principal. I quickly bowed my head, and she smiled at us."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:275
msgid "I was terribly disturbed. I hadn't seen the principal since that time."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:276
msgid "I'd completely forgotten about it, but in the end I ignored her advice."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:279
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Hello, what's the matter?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:280
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Well, we heard Mei-sensei caught a cold and came to clinic.\""

msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Umm, so Mei-sensei's...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:285
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"She is sleeping in that bed over there.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:286
msgid "She pointed to a bed in the back. It had white curtains drawn around it, so we couldn't see inside."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:287
msgid "When I listened carefully, I could hear her breathing. She didn't sound like she was suffering."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:290
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50405:293
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50405:307

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? Miya-san does? But Miya-san's the guy in the general store, isn't he...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:321
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"On this island, we use alchemy for treating medical conditions too. Miya-san has been independently researching the use of the alchemy in medicine.\""

msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"

#: 50405:326
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, I see.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:327
msgid "Now I remembered. I'd heard Miya-san was an alchemist a long time ago."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:328
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"From what Mei-sensei said, you were a great alchemist. She was telling the truth, right?\""

#: 50405:331
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50405:332
msgid "The principal said it with a sigh, and Miya-san returned a bitter smile."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:333
msgid "This was my first time seeing them both together, but I could tell they'd known each other a long time."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:334
msgid "Seeing them get together like this for Mei-sensei was impressive. They're like her parents, huh..."
msgstr ""

#: 50405:335
msgid "Also......"
msgstr ""

#: 50405:338
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"

msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"She is sleeping. Please go ahead and examine her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:344
msgid "He went inside of the curtain. I wonder if he's going to take her clothes off to examine her. If so, then maybe I shouldn't be here."

msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Haruma-kun, maybe we should leave.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:348

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? But...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50405:356
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50405:360
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
