msgid "Haruka came bolting towards me as I was walking down the corridor. She sounded like it was an emergency."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:15

msgid "{Appo}\n\"What kind of trouble is she in this time?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:16

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Let's find out.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:21

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Ka-Kazushi-kun, Ka, hah, hahh, hahh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:22

msgid "She gasped for breath as she leaned against a window. She's in a massive rush."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:23

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Calm down. Take a deep breath.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:24

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"All right......\""

#: 02801:26

msgid "I joined her in taking some deep breaths. I could tell that she was calming down."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:30

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"And what happened this time?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:35

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Ummm...have you seen me running around anywhere?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:36

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Um... Haruka? That's rather obvious...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:40

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Of course we have.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:41

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Where!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:49

msgid "{Boys}\n *STARE*"
msgstr ""

#: 02801:50

msgid "We all pointed at Haruka. She shook her head back and forth in a vigorous \"no.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:56

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"I'm not talking about me!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:57

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You've just asked us if we've seen you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:58

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"I'm talking about another me! Have you seen her or not?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:59

msgid "Has she lost her mind?"
msgstr ""

#: 02801:64

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Do you have a twin sister?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:67

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Do you think I do!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:70

msgid "{Appo}\n\"I don't think so...\nBut what do you mean another you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:71

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Anyways, we haven't seen you until just now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:72

msgid "This was getting complicated. Haruka let out a big sigh."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:75

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"I see. She must have gone somewhere else, then. Thanks, boys!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:79

msgid "Haruka took off somewhere like the wind."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:83

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Maybe she's starting to lose it after years of living in this heat every day...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:87

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"We should still stay good friends with her even if she does go completely off her rocker.\n...um...guys? What's that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:88

msgid "Pierre looked down the corridor with an air of confusion. We could all tell why."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:96

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Kazushi-kun! Kazushi-kun!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:97

msgid "Haruka was running towards us again. And not from the same direction she just departed in."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:98

msgid "In fact, Haruka was coming at us from the opposite direction."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:99

msgid "We felt like we were watching a rewound video tape."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:106

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Umm......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:107

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"That's Haruka-chan, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:108

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I think so.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:113

msgid "This Haruka seemed to be in anything but a hurry."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:116

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Hi, boys! Another hot day, isn't it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:117

msgid "This one felt a lot more like the Haruka we knew."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:122

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"This one looks a lot more like the normal Haruka, don't you think, boys?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:123

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I agree. Then that means the one we saw before was the fake Haruka?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:126

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"What are you guys whispering to each other about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:130

msgid "{Appo}\n\"This may sound weird, but we just met up with you a minute ago.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:133

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Oh, you did? Which way did I go?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:134

msgid "She didn't look surprised at all."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:135

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"That way. You seemed to be in a big hurry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:136

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Oh, I see. Yeah, I'm supposed to be all scatterbrained, aren't I? Sometimes it's exhausting to act like that, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:137

msgid "It sounded so normal that we nearly let it pass, but those words were anything but."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:141

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Act like that? What are you talking about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:145

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"You are Haruka-chan, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:146

msgid "She sounded like an actress who was stepping into the role of Haruka."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:151

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Well, the other one is also Haruka. I'm just her scapegoat.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:152

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Her scapegoat?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:156

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Hey, guys, remember when we had to supervise the principal's experiment? Haruka said she left a puppet in the classroom to fill in for her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:161

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Oh yeah, I remember her saying that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:168

msgid "{Appo}\n\"So are you the puppet she left behind?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:174

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Yes, I am.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:182

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Wow, you nailed it, Daigo.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:185

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"But you don't look like a fake at all. How do we know that you're not the original Haruka?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:189

msgid "{Haruka Doll}\n\"If you could tell us apart so easily, there wouldn't be any point to my existence.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:190

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"By the way, what are you doing here all by yourself?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:191

msgid "That's right. Haruka must be looking for her scapegoat."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:192

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Could this mean you ran away?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:193

msgid "It was just a random guess, but it seemed that I guessed right."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:196

msgid "{Haruka Doll}\n\"You don't believe what she's trying to do to me! She wants to dispose of me!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:199

msgid "{Haruka Doll}\n\"She thinks I'm disposable! She's so evil! Don't let that devilishly cute face of hers fool you, boys. She's a jinxed cunt.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:200

msgid "This doll was cutting Haruka to shreds with her words."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:206

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"A jinxed cunt... Really? Haruka-chan is... That's a shock.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:207

msgid "{Appo}\n\"She never looked like one to me. I guess appearances can be deceiving.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:210

msgid "All of us were feeling disappointed. Only the doll was happy to see Haruka's reputation fall."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:211

msgid "{Haruka Doll}\n\"Anyways, can you guys hide me somewhere safe?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:212

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I don't know.......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:215

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Well, how about......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:222

msgid "We ended up taking her to our dorm."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:223

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What are we going to do now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:225

msgid "We heard the bell ring for the start of afternoon classes."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:229

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Oh no, class is starting up again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:230

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh yeah, we've still got lessons to finish.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:236

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Who cares, the last class before break is just winding things down. And if classes are going on, then no one will come here. It's perfect.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:237

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What do you mean 'it's perfect'?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:241

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Boys, huddle up!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:248

msgid "On Appo and Pierre's signal, we all huddled our heads close together."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:249

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What is it? What are you planning?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:252

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Think about it, you guys. That's a doll. A doll that's identical to the original Haruka.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:253

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Eh? So what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:254

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"D-does that mean that what's underneath her clothes must be identical too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:255

msgid "Pierre's voice was shaking with excitement.\nNow I know exactly what they have in mind."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:256

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You guys aren't planning to...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:259

msgid "{Daigo}\n *GULP*"
msgstr ""

#: 02801:260

msgid "That was the loudest sound I have ever heard from someone swallowing his own spit."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:266

msgid "{Haruka Doll}\n\"What was that noise?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:268

msgid "She has no idea what we're talking about. She's as unguarded as a lamb surrounded by a pack of wolves."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:273

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"It's nothing! Just give us another minute!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:274

msgid "{Haruka Doll}\n\"Huh? Sure...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:282

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What are we going to do?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:285

msgid "{Appo}\n\"I say we just ask her to let us.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:286

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Let us!? Listen to yourself - that's Haruka!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:289

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"That's just a puppet. We can do this, can't we?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:290

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I know she's a puppet...\nBut, well, that's still Haruka on the surface.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:293

msgid "{Appo}\n\"That's what makes this so great. This is the perfect opportunity.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:294

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You're right...But I don't know...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:295

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Why don't we start by asking her?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:298

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Kazushi, will you ask her for us?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:299

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No way! I can't ask her that! Why me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:302

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Why don't we all ask together?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:303

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Together? All of us?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:304

msgid "{Appo}\n\"One, two...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:310

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Please let me have sex with you!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:312

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"......what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:314

msgid "I only heard my voice."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:322

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"He really did say it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:323

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"That's my man.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:324

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You guys betrayed me!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:325

msgid "I can't believe I just said that.\nI asked Haruka to have sex with me..."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:331

msgid "{Haruka Doll}\n\"Sure.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:332

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:335

msgid "{Haruka Doll}\n\"You want to have sex with me, right Kazushi? I'll let you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:338

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:339

msgid "That was unexpectedly easy. Haruka's scapegoat doll turned out to be very open minded."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:347

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Wow, she's really going to let him have sex with her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:348

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"You'll let me have sex with you too, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:349

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Guys! You guys don't deserve......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:355

msgid "{Haruka Doll}\n\"Sure.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:356

msgid "...saywha!?"
msgstr ""

#: 02801:357

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Loose! Too loose! You're being far too open-minded, Haruka!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:361

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Remember, Kazushi, she's a puppet, not Haruka.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:362

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I know......but......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:363

msgid "She looked identical to Haruka.\nI couldn't just treat her like a doll..."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:368

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"This is great. We'll be cum brothers.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:369

msgid "We looked at each other dumbfounded after Daigo's comment."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:370

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Brothers...sorta?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:377

msgid "{Appo}\n\"I guess Daigo's right. In a sense, this is a pledge between brothers!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:378

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Appo's right! I didn't suggest this idea for any naughty reasons!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:379

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I didn't know that...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:380

msgid "This was a ritual for us to deepen our connection to each other. This had to be done for the sake of our brotherhood."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:381

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"...wait a minute. Can I really trust you guys after all that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:384

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Don't think! Just feel!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:387

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Don't you want to do her?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:388

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"......I do.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:389

msgid "Of course I want to do her."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:392

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Well then, let's do it! Let's be men!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:393

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Let's be brothers!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:394

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Who's going first?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:401

msgid "{Boys}\n\"Me!!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:408

msgid "Everybody raised their hands at once. Everybody stared each other down."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:413

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"We all think the same. I say we go from the oldest to the youngest.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:414

msgid "If we followed Pierre's suggestion, the order would be Pierre, Me, Daigo, and then Appo."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:415

msgid "We're all in the same grade, of course, so the difference was just a few months on either end."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:419

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Since you guys have already done this, you can go after me and Kazushi.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:420

msgid "Daigo made an uncharacteristically bold statement. That showed just how much he wanted this."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:421

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"He's right. You aren't a virgin, are you Pierre? And you're always doing Fuusen, so you don't matter, Appo.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:426

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"I haven't gotten lucky for a couple years...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:433

msgid "{Appo}\n\"I've only done it with one person. Don't you think I should do it with someone else in order to realise how great my Fuusen is?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:434

msgid "{Appo}\n\"I need to know someone else's touch to confirm my girlfriend's abilities.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:435

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"If that's the reason, you'll have no problem going after us, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:438

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Wait a minute, guys. I still think going by age is the best idea.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:441

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Shut up, you idiot! Go away, old man!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:444

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Let's go by class rank! I'm 35th!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:447

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Daigo! You know you're the only one exceeding the class average!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:448

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Don't you look down on us just because you have good grades.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:452

msgid "*SMACK*"
msgstr ""

#: 02801:453

msgid "Appo's short temper had run out, and he hit Daigo on the head."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:454

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"What did you do that for!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:457

msgid "Bang!!"
msgstr ""

#: 02801:458

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Ugggah!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:462

msgid "And of course, he got hit back and their little squabble started."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:468

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Screw it, I'm first!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:475

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Rooooooar!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:480

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Umm...guys? Are we really going to have to decide this with violence? I thought we were supposed to be engaged in a brotherhood of men...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:481

msgid "I think the only thing getting deeper is our ditch, not our bonds. They're beating each other up."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:486

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Me! Me!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:493

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"You stay out of this, Appo. I don't want to have to hurt you.\""

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"What are you guys making so much noise for...Ah!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:508

msgid "It was Haruka - the real Haruka. She leapt into the room as she spotted her puppet."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:513

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Gotcha!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:515

msgid "Haruka captured the scapegoat puppet."

#: 02801:520

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Ah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:525

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Shit...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:526

msgid "Everything stopped. Well, that chapter's over. What were we doing?"
msgstr ""

#: 02801:532

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"You guys found her for me. Thanks for keep your eyes on her!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:533

#: 02801:555

msgid "Appo was having a hard time giving up the opportunity we had in front of us."
msgstr ""

#: 02801:556

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Are you stupid? That's the real Haruka.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:559

msgid "{Appo}\n\"How about asking her for it in return for capturing the doll?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:564

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"You're such a brute, Appo.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02801:567

msgid "{Appo}\n\"That's what we need to be. We need to be more forceful in order to get what we want.\""

#: 02801:571

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"I kind of understand what he's saying. We are being too elegant.\""
msgstr ""
