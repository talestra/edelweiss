msgstr ""

#: 20402:9

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Damn...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:10

msgid "Why does one get the urge to curse after sneezing over and over? I know I did."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:11

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"See? You caught a cold.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:12

msgid "Mizuki said though the window."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:15

msgid "I'd been sneezing for a while now. I could tell I'd managed to catch a cold. It was only natural, considering how wet I'd gotten."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:18

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I told you, didn't I?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:21

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Sorry. Did I bother you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:22

msgid "His apology ticked her off even more."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:23

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"That's not what I'm saying. I'm asking if you caught a cold, Kazushi.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:24

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, I'm fine. How about you? Okay?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:25

msgid "Mizuki didn't know what to say."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:26

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Who cares? I won't get any better anyway.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:27

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I see.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:28

msgid "Kazushi became quiet, thinking that was a dumb question. But watching his reaction also hurt Mizuki."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:29

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Anyway, don't just get drenched like that in my sight. It makes it hard to sleep!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:30

msgid "Mizuki criticized Kazushi, but he smiled for some reason."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:31

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Can I come up there, then?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:32

msgid "He took his chance and asked if he could come in. Mizuki hesitated."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:33

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"You're mixing things up!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:34

msgid "Mizuki gave him a blunt refusal. However, Kazushi just wore a wry smile, unfazed by it."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:35

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I see. Then I guess I'll go somewhere until the rain stops.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:36

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Go do that. And you don't have to come back!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:37

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"But I will.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:39

msgid "Kazushi walked off, waving back at her, soaked like a rat. Mizuki watched his back until he'd walked all the way out of sight."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:45

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:46

msgid "Mizuki woke up in the middle of the night. The afternoon rain had stopped, and her hospital room was frighteningly quiet."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:47

msgid "Ever since the accident, she'd been a bit scared of nights. Or to be more precise, darkness. She felt like she had been trapped in darkness for a while after the accident."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:48

msgid "And when she finally woke up, her legs would no longer move."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:49

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Hahh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:50

msgid "With a deep sigh, she rolled back into bed. However, rolling over didn't work like it used to."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:51

msgid "That was irritating, and little things like that left her in despair. She became this way while she was trapped in the darkness."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:52

msgid "That's why even though she knew nothing would happen anymore, she was afraid to sleep. And so her days of poor sleep and restless nights continued."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:53

msgid "But lately, she'd been able to sleep better. It was probably because Kazushi was outside. Yet still, she occasionally woke in the middle of the night like tonight."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:54

msgid "When that happened, she was done for. She felt all alone, as if she were the last person on Earth."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:55

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I'm okay...I'm okay.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:56

msgid "She tried to convince herself, yet she had the urge to scream. She was afraid, and her body trembled."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:57

msgid "Why had she pushed everyone away like that when she was so afraid of being alone?"
msgstr ""

#: 20402:58

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Three o'clock, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:59

msgid "It would still be a few more hours before morning. She might not be able to sleep until dawn."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:60

msgid "She peeked outside through a gap in the curtains. Kazushi wasn't there."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:61

msgid "Mizuki had noticed that Kazushi would disappear somewhere after lights out for a while now."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:62

msgid "She thought he might be going back to the dorm, but he was always outside her window by dawn."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:63

msgid "She sensed that he was heading somewhere else, not the dorm, but she had no idea where."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:64

msgid "Either way, Kazushi wasn't there now. Mizuki was helplessly alone and anxious on nights when she awoke and Kazushi was gone."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:65

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Kazushi...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:66

msgid "She tried calling his name. Her weak self thought that she shouldn't have told Kazushi he didn't need to come back."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:67

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Kazushi...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:68

msgid "She called his name again."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:69

msgid "{Kazushi}\n *cough*"
msgstr ""

#: 20402:70

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Ah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:71

msgid "It was Kazushi's voice. She reached her hand out and widened the gap to peer outside. She could see Kazushi there."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:74

msgid "{Kazushi}\n *COUGH*"
msgstr ""

#: 20402:75

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Maybe I really am getting sick...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:77

msgid "Be it the lack of lingering summer heat this year or the island's climate, it was already cold after the first week of September. Just as Mizuki had said, I shouldn't have gotten soaked."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:79

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I wonder if Mizuki is still asleep.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:80

msgid "I stared at her lightless window, wondering if she was sleeping well and having a nice dream."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:81

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"*Cough*...ngh...not good, not good.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:82

msgid "I covered my mouth as I coughed again. I didn't want to be too loud and wake her up."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:83

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:84

msgid "The curtain was slightly drawn back. I could see a glimpse of Mizuki through it."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:85

msgid "Did I wake her up? Or was she already up? I had a feeling it was the latter."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:86

msgid "Mizuki just stared at me."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:90

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Can't sleep?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:91

msgid "I asked her."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:92

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I just woke up.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:93

msgid "I knew it. She was already up."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:94

msgid "I know more about Mizuki than anyone else."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:95

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Do you want me to sing you a lullaby to help you sleep?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:96

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"No, thanks. I'm not a kid. But you're coughing.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:97

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Not a big deal. It's just my throat...*cough*......\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:98

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"It is a big deal. You need to sleep in a real bed for once.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:99

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'm not a child, so I'm fine. What about you? Did you have a bad dream or something?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:100

msgid "About the accident?"
msgstr ""

#: 20402:101

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I'm not a child either. Just having a bad dream doesn't keep me from sleeping.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:102

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Are you sure? Why don't you go back to sleep, then?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:103

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Yeah, I will. You really are gonna catch a cold if you are not careful.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:104

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I know. I know. Good night!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:105

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Good night!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:108

msgid "Mizuki slammed the window shut, and a heavy silence settled back over her."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:109

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I'm not a child.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:110

msgid "But she was afraid of closing her eyes. However, knowing that Kazushi was just outside her window was a bit of a relief."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:111

msgid "{Kazushi}\n *COUGH*"
msgstr ""

#: 20402:112

msgid "Another cough. Was Kazushi really coming down with a cold?"
msgstr ""

#: 20402:113

msgid "{Kazushi}\n *COUGH*"
msgstr ""

#: 20402:114

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"You're so noisy, I can't sleep.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:115

msgid "She muttered to herself. Actually, she was extremely worried about it. She wanted to force him to lie down so she could rub his back."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:116

msgid "But now the distance between them was far too great to do even that. Especially for Mizuki, who'd lost her freedom of movement."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:117

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Kazushi...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:118

msgid "She reached out to the window. Kazushi was far away from her. She couldn't even rub his back anymore."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:119

msgid "She thought to herself, \"Even if I'm with him, I can't do anything for him. And in that case, it's better for us to be apart, isn't it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:120

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Mizuki, are you asleep?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:121

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Ah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:122

msgid "Tears began to fall as she heard Kazushi's voice."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:124

msgid "I felt like Mizuki was crying in her dark room, so I called out to her, but there was no reply."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:125

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hmm? Is she asleep?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:126

msgid "I hope she's getting some sleep."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:127

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Mizu...*cough*......\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:128

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"*Cough*...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:129

msgid "I heard her voice..."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:131

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You awake?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:132

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"No, I'm sleeping.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:133

msgid "She couldn't help but reply curtly, because she thought she'd cry if she talked."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:134

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hahaha. You have been awake, haven't you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:135

msgid "And yet Kazushi laughed it off, lightening her heart."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:136

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I can't sleep if you just keep talking.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:137

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, that's right. Sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:138

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"And your coughing bothers me too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:139

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:141

msgid "So it's me that's keeping her from getting to sleep..."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:142

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'm sorry, Mizuki. I'll be quiet.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:144

msgid "Then the clinic door opened, and a nurse came out."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:145

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? What's wrong?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:146

msgid "The nurse I knew came up to me with a blanket in her hands."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:147

msgid "{Nurse}\n\"Mizuki-chan said to use this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:148

msgid "The nurse handed it to me with a chuckle."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:149

msgid "{Nurse}\n\"And this is some cold medicine.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:150

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"From Mizuki...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:151

msgid "{Nurse}\n\"She called us on emergency button.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:152

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"You don't have to tell him that!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:154

msgid "She couldn't believe that nurse, running her mouth like that."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:155

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Thanks.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:156

msgid "I could hear his voice."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:157

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Your coughing is noisy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:158

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah, I know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:159

msgid "Yes, Kazushi was probably right. Kazushi probably knew everything. Everything, including that she couldn't be honest with her feelings."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:160

msgid "She hated that fact, but she was also relieved by it."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:161

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Then I really am going back to sleep now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:162

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Sorry to bother you, Mizuki. Good night.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:163

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Yeah, good night.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:164

msgid "She pulled the sheets over her head. This time, she was likely to sleep."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:166

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Hey, Kazushi.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:167

msgid "There was something she wanted to tell him before she did. Something she hadn't been able to say this whole time. Something she thought she could say now."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:168

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hmm? What's up?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:169

msgid "Kazushi sounded a bit sleepy. Were the warm blanket and cold pills working?"
msgstr ""

#: 20402:170

msgid "That's perfect. She wanted him to listen as he dozed off."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:171

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I'm sorry about the other day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:172

msgid "She hadn't been able to say that. She had taken it out on Kazushi and everyone else."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:173

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:174

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Sure, don't worry about it. Apologize to everyone else too next time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:175

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Yeah, I will.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:176

msgid "She didn't know if they'd accept it or not, but she would apologize."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:177

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No worries, Mizuki. They'll understand.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:178

msgid "His drowsy voice gave her comfort."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:179

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Thanks.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:180

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Go to sleep, Mizuki. I'm sleepy too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:181

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Yes. Good night.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:182

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Sleep well and stay healthy, Mizuki. Otherwise you won't get your legs fixed.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:183

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"What? My legs?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:184

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I told you. I will cure your legs.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:185

msgid "He sounded half-asleep. He was probably talking in his sleep by now. It wasn't very convincing, hearing it like that."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:186

msgid "But nonetheless, it put Mizuki at ease."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:187

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Okay. I'll be waiting.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:188

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah, you wait.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:189

msgid "That was his final reply. She could hear him snoring through the window."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:190

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Good night...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:191

msgid "Mizuki whispered one last time. Then, with Kazushi's snoring as her lullaby, she drifted off into a relaxing slumber."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:199

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Wowww!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:200

msgid "The flask broke into pieces. We failed again!"
msgstr ""

#: 20402:203

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Shit! It didn't work at all!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:204

msgid "We all tried refinements in many different ways, but weren't getting any results. We knew it wasn't going to be easy, but we were all getting frustrated."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:208

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Maybe it's too difficult for us to do it... What do you think, Mei-chan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:213

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Well, it is difficult - no question about that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:214

msgid "Mei-sensei nodded with a serious look. She didn't give us any consolation. That's how harsh this situation was."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:215

msgid "{Mei}\n\"I heard about Hinata-san's legs from Miya-san. He said her legs were damaged to the point that their shape was nearly gone.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:216

msgid "Mizuki's injuries were so bad that these girls looked away just from hearing about it. The reason they didn't look that way was thanks to Miya-san's alchemy."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:217

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Miya-san restored her legs, but only on the surface. He couldn't bring life to them, so to speak.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:218

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Life?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:219

msgid "{Mei}\n\"In other words, though her legs look fine, they are already 'dead'.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:220

msgid "I knew that much from seeing her every day."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:221

msgid "Mizuki's legs couldn't move at all, and they didn't even look like part of her body."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:222

msgid "That was how foreign they looked. They were attached to her body, but they gave the impression that blood wasn't flowing through them."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:225

msgid "{Mei}\n\"In order to cure Hinata-san's life, we need a technique close to the 'creation' or 'resuscitation' of life. I don't think I need to explain how difficult that is.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:230

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Resuscitation of life...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:231

msgid "The skills to bring the dead back to life. Yes, it sure does sound very difficult to do."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:232

msgid "So what we are trying to do is an extremely difficult task."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:237

msgid "{Mei}\n\"It seems Miya-san is thinking of passing a 'core' through those legs to make them artificial legs in the worst scenario. Since they are her legs, they'll at least look good.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:239

msgid "They're perfect for artificial legs, in other words. As a girl, Mizuki should care about how her legs looked, so such a way may be the best way as the last resort."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:240

msgid "But no matter how difficult it may be, I want to bring life back to her legs."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:241

msgid "I want her to be able to swim with the dolphins once again. I want her to make her dreams of swimming in waters all around the world come true."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:242

msgid "Is that wish asking for too much?"
msgstr ""

#: 20402:246

msgid "{Appo}\n\"I don't understand all this theoretical stuff. We just have to do it, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:247

msgid "Appo's happy-go-lucky personality broke the bleak atmosphere."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:252

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Yeah, our grades are on the low side, so we won't know until we try.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:259

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"I was in the 30th percentile though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:263

msgid "{Ran}\n\"30? That's low.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:266

msgid "{Appo}\n\"I understand it's difficult. So no matter how difficult it is, let's just keep trying what we can.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:267

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"If you don't swing the bat, you'll never hit the ball. If you swing the bat, you might at least hit it by accident.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:271

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"If her legs can really move, it doesn't matter whether it's a miracle or what...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:275

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Wow, just the lines you'd expect from dumb kids. It's like positivity's all they have.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:278

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:282

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"But there's no point in being pessimistic. It feels good to have a positive attitude.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:289

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"And that'll lead to better results too, I'm sure.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:291

msgid "Everyone was gaining enthusiasm.\nYes, we can!\nThere's nothing to back that up, but we have to stay positive."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:297

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:298

msgid "Among them, Haruka seemed to be contemplating something."
msgstr ""

#: 20402:299

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What's up, Haruka?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20402:302

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Yeah, something caught my mind. Mei-chan, you just said we need a technique close to the 'creation' or 'resuscitation' of life, right?\""
