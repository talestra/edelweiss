msgid "{Appo}\n\"You think I've become abnormal?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:10

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You're not abnormal. Well, I mean, you've never been normal in your entire life, but aside from that you're not.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:13

msgid "{Appo}\n\"That's hard to understand. Well, so long as I haven't changed or anything.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:18

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Are you sure you wanted us to come along? Wouldn't you rather be alone with her?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:21

msgid "{Appo}\n\"You idiot! Are you going to abandon me?! And you call yourself a friend?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:28

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"It's because we're your friends that we're trying to be considerate.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:29

msgid "{Appo}\n\"No!\nI wouldn't know what to talk to her about if you guys left us alone.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:30

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"All right. Just for today, OK?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:31

msgid "Today is the first Sunday since they started going out."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:32

msgid "This is their first proper date."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:33

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"I didn't know you were such a scaredy cat, Appo. You should meet up for a date by yourself.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:34

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Don't act so cold! You're a friend, aren't you?! You're killing me!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:37

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Why are you getting so mad?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:40

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"His head's all full. With Fuusen.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:43

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Kazuko-san is running late.\nI hope she hasn't gotten into an accident or anything like that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:44

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Kazuko-san?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:47

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Talk about a total 180.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:48

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:49

msgid "Until just a few days ago, Appo didn't even treat her like a human being. Now he worshipped her like a goddess."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:55

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"I'm sorry, I'm late.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:59

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Ah!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:64

msgid "Appo froze at Fuusen's graceful voice. Hearing her sound like that certainly gave me the shivers too."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:65

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Good morning, Kazuko-san!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:68

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Good morning.\nDid I make you wait?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:69

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Not at all!\nWe just got here, too!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:70

msgid "Silly Appo, getting panicky over Fuusen. The girls who came along with her were laughing from behind her."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:79

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Good morning.\nIt's a perfect day for......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:80

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Stop that greeting. This isn't some marriage interview.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:81

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Are you sure we should all hang out together?\nThis is their first date.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:89

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"A date? Our main goal today is shopping. Nothing wrong with everyone going.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:90

msgid "{Appo}\n\"And Kazuko-san is going to show us around the island.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:99

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"You haven't really been shown around yet after all. There are some things you can't buy at school, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:100

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Yeah, I want to go to a bookstore.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:101

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Oh yeah, I've just about gone through all the ones I brought too. There is a bookstore, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:105

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Wow, I would've never guessed you were all avid readers.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:106

msgid "Except the books they're buying are just pin-up magazines. I should probably grab one too."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:114

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Shall we?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:115

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Let's go.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:116

msgid "Appo and Fuusen walked off side-by-side. They looked scarily good together."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:123

msgid "{Ran}\n\"From back here, they look like a perfect match.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:124

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I know. It's like destiny.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:129

msgid "The first store they led us to was an ordinary looking store we'd never been to. The signboard read \"Belly-Splitter\". What the hell kind of name is that."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:134

msgid "{Appo}\n\"What kind of a store is this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:135

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"A general store, I guess? You can buy anything from daily goods to Alchemy supplies.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:140

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Originally this store sold exclusively Alchemy supplies, but at some point they started carrying other things too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:141

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Wow, alchemy supplies?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:142

msgid "This store did? It didn't look like it."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:146

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Let's go in. Hello! Pops, you in?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:150

msgid "A man came out from the back room as we entered. I probably shouldn't say it, but he was a dull-looking, middle aged man."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:155

msgid "{Store Owner}\n\"Oh, Ran-chan, hello. Oh? Quite a few with you today.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:158

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I've brought you some business, so give me a cut, OK?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:161

msgid "{Store Owner}\n\"Hahaha, I can't compete with you, Ran-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:169

msgid "He turned towards us as he scratched his head. Beneath his glasses rested a pair of thin eyes and a gentle smile."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:170

msgid "{Store Owner}\n\"You must be the new boys. I'm really glad to have more men on the island. There's not much to talk about with just young women.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:171

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Hello.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:172

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Nice to meet you!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:173

msgid "{Store Owner}\n\"Nice to meet you too.\nHow can I help you today? We have just about everything you could need.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:180

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Miya-san, actually......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:181

msgid "Fuusen leaned up close and whispered in his ear. I guess his name's Miya-san."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:184

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"...do you have any?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:187

msgid "For some reason, the store owner's face turned red."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:188

msgid "{Miya}\n\"Yes, but... are you going to use them?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:189

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Yes, they're for him...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:196

msgid "Fuusen grabbed Appo by the arm."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:197

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"He's really healthy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:200

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Yes, I am very healthy!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:201

msgid "{Miya}\n\"I-I see. Good. Umm... have fun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:202

msgid "Miya-san was acting weird. What did Fuusen order from him?"
msgstr ""

#: 02006:208

msgid "{Miya}\n\"Umm, well. I'll go wrap them up. How many did you need?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:211

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Hmmm... We'll use a lot anyways, so give us a dozen.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:214

msgid "{Miya}\n\"A dozen boxes...\nEach box has 12...\nYou really want 12 boxes!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:215

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Yup, 144 should be enough for a month.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:216

msgid "{Miya}\n\"Enough for a MONTH!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:220

msgid "For some reason the store owner was looking jealously at Appo."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:221

msgid "{Miya}\n\"How wonderful to be young...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:222

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:225

msgid "{Miya}\n\"I'll go get them, so please wait a moment.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:228

msgid "The store owner disappeared into the back room."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:233

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Hey, Kazuko-chan, what'd you buy?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:236

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Something in great demand amongst couples.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:240

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Huh? You mean...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:241

msgid "Mizuki's face turned bright red. For someone who doesn't like dirty topics, she always picked up on them."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:248

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Are you really going to buy those on your first date? I can't tell if that's sexy or not.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:249

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Appo, are you really going to do it 144 times in a month? I'm jealous.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:250

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"It's almost summer, too. We need to try harder.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:253

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Yeah. Better find a partner soon so we don't end up wasting our summer.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:256

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"I-I'll find one. I'll find one.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:261

msgid "{Miya}\n\"Thanks for waiting.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:262

msgid "He returned from the storeroom. He looked like just a regular merchant."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:263

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Are you an alchemist, too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:264

msgid "It was bugging me, so I asked. He must be if he owns an alchemy store."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:267

msgid "{Miya}\n\"Well, just a small-time one. I'm not very knowledgeable either, so please don't ask me much when you're shopping.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:268

msgid "He scratched his head with a pained smile. No offense, but he doesn't really look like a good one either."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:273

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Miya-san, you're so modest.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:274

msgid "Haruka teased him."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:275

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"He's good, then?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:278

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Of course. He's the--\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:281

msgid "{Miya}\n\"You don't have to tell him.\nIs there anything else I can help you guys with?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:282

msgid "He didn't seem to want to talk about it. He looked like an average person, but maybe he wasn't?"
msgstr ""

#: 02006:286

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:287

msgid "His face looked so familiar."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:288

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Have we met before?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:289

msgid "I had a sense of deja vu, like we'd met before..."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:290

msgid "{Miya}\n\"Have we?...I don't recall it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:291

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I suppose you're right. I don't recall it either.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:294

msgid "{Miya}\n\"Huh? What's with that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:295

msgid "He started laughing.\nBut... I still felt like I'd met him before somewhere."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:296

msgid "Maybe he looks someone I know. But who?"
msgstr ""

#: 02006:300

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Kazushi! Haruka!\nLet's go!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:305

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Sorry, girls. I have to go visit grandma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:306

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, okay. That's a shame.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:307

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"We'll do this again sometime!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:308

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Sure.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:313

msgid "I turned back to the store owner."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:314

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Sorry for saying something so strange.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:315

msgid "{Miya}\n\"It's OK. It's been a while since I've talked to some young guys. Come back again some time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:316

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Good bye.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:321

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Bye.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:322

msgid "After Haruka's bright goodbye, Miya-san saw us off with a gentle smile."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:323

msgid "Miya-san, huh?"
msgstr ""

#: 02006:326

msgid "He's a strange man."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:333

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Sorry, guys. We've actually got something to take care of.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:334

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"You'll have to excuse us.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:335

msgid "For two people who said they had to head back, they sure were acting fidgety."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:340

msgid "{Ran}\n\"You have to leave now? Both of you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:346

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Actually, we have to take care of it together.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:347

msgid "Fuusen was holding her new purchase in her hand. I guess they were already in the mood."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:350

msgid "{Appo}\n\"See you, guys! Alright, let's go.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:353

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"I can't wait any longer!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:356

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Then let's do it somewhere close!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:359

msgid "They quickly disappeared into a back street."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:362

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"I hope they get caught finishing their business and arrested.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:367

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Finish their business? ...Hey, cut that out!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:370

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"What should we do now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:374

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"I wanna go back to my room.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:375

msgid "Daigo was hugging the bag of stuff he bought from the bookstore. I guess he's in the mood too."
msgstr ""

#: 02006:376

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Why are you getting excited already? Where they selling something that amazing?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:379

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Y-yeah, they were. You won't believe it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:380

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Really? That good?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:383

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"......should we go home, too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:388

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What? Everyone's going home.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:393

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Why don't we call it a day, then?\nThere's somewhere I want to stop on my way back.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:394

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"All right. Then let's call it a day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:399

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"I'm going home!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02006:404

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"What are you going to do, Kazushi?\""
