"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Wow, the sun's so bright!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:10
msgid "The ocean sparkled in the morning sunlight, which was too bright for my eyes after staying up all night."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:11
msgid "Mizuki's riotous party lasted until it was nearly dawn, so we decided to stay up and come watch the sunrise together."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"We didn't get to sleep at all, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:15
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Everyone else fell asleep, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:16
msgid "All our friends passed out in the cafeteria. Mizuki and I were the only ones that stayed awake through the end, so we decided to go outside and take a walk."

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Thank you, Kazushi. I really had a good time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:20
msgid ""
"I felt a little shy hearing Mizuki thank me so honestly for once. Did she do that just because she's a year older now?\n"
"The sun seems kind of brighter than normal today..."

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"This is the first time I've ever had a birthday party like that thrown for me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:24
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Really? Well, I guess people do stop having them less as they get older. But you had plenty as a kid, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:25
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"In my case, it was always on a bad day. I mean, August 1st is in the middle of summer break, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:26
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh...you're right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:27
msgid "It reminded me that summer vacation was still going on. I almost forgot about it because we were all together just like usual."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:28
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"I know how Kudou-kun felt when he said he'd never had his own birthday party before. During summer break, no one except your family's around to celebrate your birthday.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:29
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"There's no school, and everyone likes to go on family trips too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:30
msgid "When I was a kid, I was never home during the summer."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:31
msgid "I would always do all kinds of activities like going off to summer camps, visiting my grandparents, taking family holidays..."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:32
msgid "I'd spend almost the entire summer playing my head off."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:35
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"That's why I never got to have a party with my friends. But last night was a lot of fun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:36
msgid "Mizuki gave me a humble, yet beaming smile. Up to the crack of dawn, she was romping around with everyone else at the party."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:37
msgid "I wish I could have had more time to prepare a bigger party for her."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:38
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"We'll have to throw an even bigger party for you next year.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:39
msgid "Next year will be my comeback performance. I'll surprise her even more than this year."

#: 20202:42
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"What? Are we doing it again next year?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:43
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Of course. Next year, and the year after that...as you get older.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:46
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Year after next? You know, we'll be graduating by then.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:47
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, that's right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:48
msgid "I never thought of graduation. Gee, I won't be here in two years?"
msgstr ""

#: 20202:49
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Graduation, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:50
msgid "It's funny. I just came to this island a month ago, but I can already feel how much I'm going to miss it."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:53
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Hmm? What's wrong with you, reminiscing at dawn?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:54
msgid "Mizuki peered into my eyes as I contemplated it. Then I noticed her gaze, and we twitched as our eyes met."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:57
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"S-sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:59
msgid "Flushing slightly, she turned her head away."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:62
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Ahaha, this is strange.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:64
msgid "She ran off towards the water while scratching her head in embarrassment."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:65
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, where are you going?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:66
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"No! Don't come here!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:67
msgid "Her panicked voice. What's she doing?"
msgstr ""

#: 20202:69
msgid "*SPLASH*"
msgstr ""

#: 20202:71
msgid "I heard a splash from the ocean echoing against the rocks. It must be Mizuki jumping in."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:72
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, Mizuki. Are you okay? You didn't get any sleep, you know?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:73
msgid "Mizuki came straight here with me after drinking and making merry at the party all night. This could be too dangerous, even for her."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:74
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Mmmmmm! It feels so good!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:75
msgid "Despite my concerns, Mizuki was swimming around pleasantly."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:76
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Are you okay?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:77
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"I'm more than okay! Who do you think I am?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:78
msgid "Well, I was worried for nothing then."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:79
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You are pretty tough, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:80
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Yeah, I kind of am, but so are you, Kazushi.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:81
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's right. I'm much tougher than you are.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:82
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Oh, you said it. Then let's race! One lap around the island!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:83
msgid "Mizuki began to swim with great vigor."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:84
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, I didn't say I would.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:85
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"I win by default then!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:87
msgid "Damn..."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:88
msgid "I hate to lose, but I know I'm not gonna win - I'm still not at swimming."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:89
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Besides, aren't you still drunk? It's not safe to swim under the influence, especially with your clothes still on...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:90
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hmm?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:91
msgid "Then, something dotting the rocky path caught my eye. They looked like clothes."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:92
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, these are your clothes!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:93
msgid "I picked them up and recognized them as hers. I guess she took all her clothes off before getting in the water."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:94
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Hehe. I made sure to strip off my clothes!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:95
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"When did you...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:96
msgid "That means she's naked under the water... Ggh, just imagining that was seductive to my mind and body, already excited by the all-night party."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:97
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No. No. No...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:98
msgid "Just thinking about it was nearly making me hard so I tried to distract myself by folding her clothes."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:99
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:100
msgid "If she stripped down to swim, that means she stripped off her underwear too. I could see her panties mixed in with the rest of her clothes."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:101
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\".........\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:102
msgid "I picked them up. They were still warm."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:103
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So warm...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:104
msgid "I stretched them out. Why does doing something perverted like this always get me so damn turned on?"
msgstr ""

#: 20202:105
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wooooooo!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:106
msgid "Since we pulled an all-nighter, she must have been wearing these all day yesterday."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:107
msgid "I saw some stains in the center, indicating that it was true..."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:108
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Gyaaaaaaah!! H-hey! What the hell are you spreading and looking at, you idiot?!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:109
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, shit...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:110
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"You pervert! Lunatic!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:111
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:112
msgid "OK, if you're going to play it that way, I'll do exactly what a pervert does."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:113
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, I see. Then this is Mizuki's..... Ooooh, I think I see a little hair in here...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:114
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Why youuuuuuuu!!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:117
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Ah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:118
msgid "I think this is what they called deja vu. The sight was rather nostalgic."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:122
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:126
msgid "But it wasn't nostalgic for Mizuki. She hid in the rock's shadows."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:127
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Ooh... He saw me again...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:128
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm impressed - you look so different from yesterday. Your body's finally another year older, and it looks more mature too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:129
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Nothing's going to change in just a day! Ohhh, why does Kazushi keep seeing me when I'm naked? It really bugs me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:130
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"All I can say is sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:131
msgid "I don't do it on purpose, so it's not really my fault, and Mizuki knows it too."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:132
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I can only say that we were burn under such stars. Surely, it's destiny.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:133
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"I don't want that destiny!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:134
msgid "Mizuki screamed out to the blue morning sky. But for some reason, she looked happy doing it."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:135
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Does it really bother you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:136
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Of course it does! How could I... let such places be seen. I'm sure... no one will want to take me as a bride now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:137
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Then... what if I said I would?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:138
msgid "I surprised myself at how easily I said that."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:143
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:144
msgid "Mizuki looks vacant and flushed."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:145
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"K-Kazushi, look, do you really know what you are saying?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:146
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Y-yeah! I said I'll take you in.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:147
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Take me in... I'm not a dog or a cat. What do you plan on doing if you take me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:148
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well... I'd make you happy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:149
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\".........\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:151
msgid ""
"For a moment, we heard nothing but the waves lapping up against the shore.\n"
"No... I can hear someone's heart beating.\n"
"Wait, it's mine."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:153
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"A-aren't you embarrassed, s-saying something like that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:154
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"V-very much so.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:155
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Right? I'd be too...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:156
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But I mean it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:157
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"What? You mean it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:158
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I mean it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:159
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\".........\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:160
msgid "Mizuki remained silent. We could hear the waves."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:161
msgid "I finally said something decisive. But now that I have, there's no turning back."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:162
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, Mizuki...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:163
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"W-what is it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:164
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Umm, would you g-go out with me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:165
msgid "Damn! I said it! My heart nearly exploded."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:166
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\".........\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:167
msgid "Mizuki kept quiet and turns around."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:168
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Weren't we already going out?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:169
msgid "She whispered that to me as she faced away. Does that mean yes?"
msgstr ""

#: 20202:170
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, yeah. Right, we are already...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:171
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Yeah, that's right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:172
msgid "Mizuki sounded very calm while keeping her back to me, standing shoulder deep in the water."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:173
msgid "Her back was turned, yet I knew all of her focus was on me."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:174
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Can I come over there?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:175
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Huh? Wh-why?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:176
msgid "She sounded a bit confused, but she already knew what I was going to ask, and..."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:177
msgid "She was probably certain about what I wanted. For someone not good with dirty jokes, she's awfully sharp."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:178
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You don't want me to?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:179
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"It's okay.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:180

#: 20202:182
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Yes...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:184
msgid "I walked over to the rocky stretch where Mizuki was."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:185
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\".........\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:186
msgid "I could see Mizuki's back. I could reach out and touch her from here. She still wasn't moving."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:187
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Mizuki, are you... sure about this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:188
msgid "She knows what I mean. Her shoulders trembled slightly as proof."
msgstr ""

#: 20202:189
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Are you sure you're alright with me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20202:190
