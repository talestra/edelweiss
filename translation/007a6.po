msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hi......\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:36
msgid "I knew she wasn't able to hear me, but I bowed to her anyways. The principal put on an elegant smile, said something to Haruka, and urged her towards me."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:39
msgid "Haruka made her way through the crowd towards me."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:42
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Hah, I finally made it. There're so many people here!\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

#: 007a6:49
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? How could she?\n"
"I've hardly ever spoken to her. She shouldn't even know me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:52
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

#: 007a6:53
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 007a6:62
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"She gets mad at me if I don't call her 'Principal' at school. I try my best to be careful, but this mouth of mine...\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:63
msgid "She pinched her lips. I guess Haruka calls the principal 'grandma' outside of school."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:64
msgid "I'm sure it's only natural for them, but the idea seemed charming to me."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:65
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I bet you can get away with it today. It is a party, and we do have alcohol.\""

msgstr ""

#: 007a6:75
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Wow!\n"
"I'm having a man pour me a drink. Does this make me a delinquent?\""

#: 007a6:77
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 007a6:80
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 007a6:81
msgid "She's already in a good mood and she hasn't even had a sip yet! What a strange girl."

#: 007a6:84
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

#: 007a6:85

msgstr ""

#: 007a6:100
msgid ""
"She already remembered my name.\n"
"She had a kind, graceful smile, but something felt wrong."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:103
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Here, Kazushi-kun!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:104
msgid "Haruka handed me an empty glass and a bottle of liquor. I prepared for the worst and handed the glass to the Principal."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:105
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Here you go, ma'am.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:108
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Why, thank you very much.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:110
msgid "I was nervous as I tried to pour it without spilling any. I glanced up and saw the Principal blushing like a young girl."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:113
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"I feel so embarrassed. You remind me of him.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:115

msgstr ""

#: 007a6:119
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh. I'm sorry...\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:120
msgid "So the principal is a widow. I guess they did mention that there weren't any male teachers at this academy."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:121
msgid "I wish I knew what to say at times like these."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:124
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Don't trouble yourself. It happened many long years ago.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:125
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I never knew my grandpa either. He passed away before I was born.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:126
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see. In my case, I never knew my grandma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:127
msgid "My grandma was already gone by the time I was born. I heard that she had died from an illness when she was young."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:128
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"My grandpa used to talk about her all the time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:131

"{Haruka}\n"
"\"It's the same in my family!\n"
"Grandma talks about grandpa all the time!\""

"{Principal}\n"
"\"Haruka,\n"
"you need to call me \"Principal\" here.\""

#: 007a6:135
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Oh, shoot! See?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:138
msgid "Haruka winked at me. We had just talked about it, but the principal was slightly confused."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:139
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"It looks like you're getting along well with Haruma-kun. I'm glad you've made a good friend.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:140
msgid "When she said that, the principal's face went back to being grandma."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:143
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get along with the boys, but luckily there are those like Kazushi-kun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:144
msgid "Putting it that way made me blush. The principal watched us with the proud smile of a grandmother."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:147
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Well, I better be going now. Thank you very much for the drink, Haruma-kun. You've made me feel young again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:148
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You're welcome.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:151
msgid "After giving us another graceful smile, she finally left. The tension finally drained from my shoulders."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:154
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"She seemed really happy. Thank you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:155
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No, don't mention it. All I did was pour a drink. Anyways, your grandma looks pretty young.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:156
msgid "I didn't know how old she was, but her skin was still radiant."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:159
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"It's just because you talked to her, Kazushi-kun. She said you made her feel young.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:160
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:161
msgid "Did she just drain my youth?"
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:164
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Grandma is still in love with grandpa.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:165
msgid "I thought I heard the tone of her voice drop, and I looked over to find a sad smile on her face."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:166
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Hey, Kazushi-kun.\n"
"What would you do if your lover died?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:167
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"If my lover died?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:168
msgid "That was a rather serious question all of a sudden."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:169
msgid "I didn't know why she asked, nor how to answer."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:172
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I'm sorry. Was that a weird question?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:173
msgid "She noticed I was having trouble answering, so she tried to play it off with a smile."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:174
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's OK, but why did you ask?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:177
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Well, sometimes when I look at grandma, I think about how she can't forget about grandpa. I'm sure she's lonely.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:180
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I've been told that they struggled so much to get married.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:181
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"The principal did? Wow, I didn't know...\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:182
msgid "It was hard to imagine that from the strict image the principal had now."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:183
msgid "But I guess it's not surprising. They say she was really pretty when she was young. Such a romance would only be natural for her."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:186
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"But, grandpa died in an accident only a year after they got married.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:187
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That soon?\n"
"That is sad... She's been alone ever since?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:190
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Yes, she has. I'm sure she's never been able to forget about him.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:191
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see.\n"
"She must have really loved him.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:194
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"She did.\n"
"I dream about being in a relationship like that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:195
msgid "She looked little girl in love with romance as she told me about her sweet dream. Haruka in love, huh? I wonder what kind of guy she likes."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:196
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Have you ever fallen in love with somebody?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:199
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"What?! Of course not!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:200
msgid "She shook her head in surprise."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:201
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Never?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:202
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"There aren't any boys my age on this island. How could I have met or fallen in love with anyone?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:203
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, I suppose that's true...\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:204
msgid "Of course, there weren't any boys likely to have gone after Haruka before."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:207
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I always worried I might grow old without ever getting to fall in love. Hey, Kazushi-kun, have you ever been in love?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:208
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Only as much as everyone else.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:211
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Wow, how nice. People our age should already be in love, shouldn't they? Hah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:212
msgid "She heaved a deep sigh. I kind of felt bad for her."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:215
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"So, what's it like to fall in love?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:216
msgid "She leaned forward as she asked me. Her eyes were sparkling. She was so innocent."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:217
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's like......\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:221
msgid "I recalled a few of my previous encounters. There was the time I got slapped hard as the sun set on the park, the time one girl called me a pervert and stepped on me..."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:225
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Huh? Why are you crying?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:226
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"All my heartbreaking memories...\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:229
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I see. Love is so touching it brings tears.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:230
msgid "She missed the real meaning behind my words, and looked up the sky with glittering eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:231
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I want to fall in love too. I wonder how I can make that happen?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:232
msgid "She looked just like a dreamy-eyed girl. She looked so pure and bright that I wanted to cheer her on."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:233
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I hope that one day you'll have a romance just like your grandparents had. You have my support.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:236
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Really? Thank you!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:237
msgid "She happily took my hand in hers. Her hands felt so soft. Their warmth ran through me like a bolt of electricity."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:238
msgid "Oh, no. I think I'm falling in love."
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:241
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Love, huh? It's so nice. I wonder how I can start a relationship?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007a6:242
msgid "My loves had been too simple. They all led to terrible things too. I need to be a bit more prudent."
