msgstr ""

#: 02206:56
msgid "Speak of the devil, it was Fuusen. She was a little hesitant to come in."

#: 02206:57

msgstr ""

#: 02206:71

"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"My parents sent me some peaches.\n"
"I brought a few for you to share with your friends.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:86
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"That's a great idea. That's my Fuu-chan for you, so considerate. What a sinful woman you are, being so caring as well as cute.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:89
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Oh, Ah-chan, not in front of your friends. It's embarrassing.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:90
msgid "Fuusen blushed, and Appo touched her hair ever so gently."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:97
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Is this what they call a farce?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:98
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"No, more like a cheap act.\""

#: 02206:99
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Either way, they're off in their own world.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:100
msgid "It was a pretty strong barrier too. We couldn't get near them, let alone interrupt."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:105
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Then let me borrow some plates. I'll peel the peaches in no time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:107
msgid "Fuusen stood up with the peaches. She'd even brought a knife with her."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:112
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"But man, people sure can change. Who could have imagined this a week ago?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:115
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"She looks cuter now.\n"
"...maybe not.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:116
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"She is cuter, isn't she?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:118
msgid "When the inside changes, the outside appears differently too. All the loathsomeness from before was gone, and instead of seeming like she was making the whole world an enemy, she started to look cute despite her ugliness."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:126
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Hey, Ah-chan, finals are coming up soon. Will you be okay? Would you like me to help you study?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:129
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"You're offering to help me study? That would be great!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:130
msgid "He turned around towards us as if he suddenly thought of something. A leering grin was plastered on his face."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:133
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"That's right. Do you want to join us? It's not like you were planning to study anyways, right? Let's have Fuu-chan teach us all.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:134
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't let us get in your way.\""

"\"You two enjoy your companionship.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:143
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Oh, I'm sorry, it's like I'm monopolizing Ah-chan. I know we're going out now, but I don't want him to lose any friends, either.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:147
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Hey, now she's acting like some nice wife.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:148
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Love is magic. Aaggh, I want to fall in love too!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:150
msgid "My chest felt heavy and I flailed about. What the hell is love for it to change those two this much?"
msgstr ""

#: 02206:151
msgid "Watching my friend who used to be in the same spot as us change this much just because he landed a girlfriend first planted the seeds of anxiety within me."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:152
msgid "I was certain Daigo and Pierre felt the same way."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:153
msgid "Love, huh?"
msgstr ""

#: 02206:158
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Man, Fuusen is all over Appo now. She used to always hang out with Andou.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:161
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"I wonder how Andou's taking this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:162
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"She hasn't stood out in a while.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:163
msgid "I hardly even noticed her in the class lately, even though a little while ago both her and Fuusen stuck out like eyesores."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:164
msgid "I was actually a little curious as to why we hadn't noticed her much with that huge body of hers."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:167
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"It shows that girls' friendships mean nothing once they get a man.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:170
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"A girl's friendship only lasts until she gets a boyfriend?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:171
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You can't really compare between friendship and love, can you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:174
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Girls are different aren't they? Always calculating what will and won't benefit them, and prioritizing what does.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:175
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You think so?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:176
msgid "If that's the case, then how sad. I could imagine how small that huge girl must feel, and felt a little sorry for her."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:183
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:184
msgid "Even a nice hot bath didn't help Rei feel refreshed. Her body was already heavy, but her feet were even heavier as she headed to her room."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:190
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Oh, Rei-chan. Are you already done with your bath?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:191
msgid "Sakura and Rin entered as she was leaving, getting ready to take their bath together. They only served to remind Rei of how it was until a week ago..."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:192
msgid "It made Rei feel even lonelier."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:195
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Huh? Were you alone today? I haven't seen you with Kazuko-chan lately.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:196
msgid "Everybody was starting to notice. They were all talking about it."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:199
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Remember, Kazuko-chan just found a boyfriend, didn't she? They're all lovey-dovey right now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:202
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Oh, I see.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:203
msgid "They were right. But it got harder and harder for her as more people started noticing."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:204
msgid "Nobody understood what Rei was going through at that point."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:209
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"That man hasn't changed anything. I still talk with Kazuko-chan plenty every day. I just try to show some consideration in the afternoon.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:215
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"You're right. They did just start going out.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:220
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Besides, I can still talk to her at night when we're in the dorms.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:222
msgid "In reality, though, Kazuko rarely came back to her room at nights, and even if she did, it was late and she went right to sleep."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:223
msgid "She was probably out with him as long as she could be. Nothing made Fuusen happier than spending time with Appo."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:224
msgid "Definitely not hanging out with Rei..."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:225
msgid "She stopped thinking about it because it only made her lonelier still."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:230
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Are you all right, Rei-chan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:231
msgid "The two of them were looking at her in concern. Even she started to worry about how she must look."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:232
msgid "The last thing Rei wanted was for people to notice how lonely she was. There was no reason for her to be. Kazuko hadn't been stolen away by some man."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:237
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"O-of course I'm alright. But I think I stayed in a little too long. I'm going to go rest in my room.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:238
msgid "After saying goodbye, she turned to head back."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:240
msgid "Just when she tried to leave, she tripped on something."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:243
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"What's this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:244
msgid "She picked up something small and metallic from off the ground. It was familiar."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:250
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Hey, I know what that is.\n"
"That's Harucchi's tie pin. He always has a bunch of them on.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:251
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Oh yeah. That's Haruma-kun's.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:252
msgid "They were likely right. Rei had seen it on Kazushi's tie as well."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:257
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"One of HIS friends.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:258
msgid "She was surprised by what came out of her mouth."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:264
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Who are you talking about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:269
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"N-nothing.\n"
"I'll make sure this gets back to Haruma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:270
msgid "She ended up saying that to cover up her own line. But then she thought, \"Why do I have to deliver something some guy dropped?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:271
msgid "She later regretted taking responsibility for delivering it."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:277
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Then I'll leave it up to you, Rei-chan. It's probably best to bring it to him in the morning.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:282
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Yeah, I will.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:288
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"This might spark something between you two.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:289
msgid "Rei actually got upset at Sakura's irresponsible, teasing remarks, but she held it in to keep them from noticing."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:292
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"I know. Kazuko-chan does have a boyfriend now. It's not fair that she quickly found one after hating the boys so much.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:295
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"No! I won't let a boy take you away from me, Rin!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:298
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"No, don't cling to me. Ah, where are you touching?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:299
msgid "Even their exchange looked bright to Rei. She didn't want to stay any more."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:304
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"See you guys later.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:310
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Oh, sorry for stopping you. Let's go take our bath.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:313
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Bye, Rei-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:318
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Bye.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:321
msgid "The two girls were still fawning over each other on the way to the shower room."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:322
msgid "Rei couldn't help but sigh as she watched them."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:323
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"I wish those boys had never come here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:324
msgid "Then she'd have never have had to go through this. She felt hatred towards the boys."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:327
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"They should all up and leave.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:328
msgid "She clenched her fists in anger. That's when she realized that she still had something in her palm."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:329
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Stupid tie pin......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:330
msgid "She felt that she had no obligation to return it. She was about to throw it away, but stopped. Was there some other way for her to use it?"
msgstr ""

#: 02206:333
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"......That's it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:334
msgid "She kept on walking with the tie pin in her palm."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:339
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What's Appo doing out so late?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:340
msgid "He still hadn't come back from escorting Fuusen to her dorm."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:345
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"They must be enjoying themselves. ...Yuck, I imagined that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:348
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"He's been sneaking into the girls' dorm lately to spend extra time with her. The school too. I hope he doesn't get into trouble again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:351
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"But isn't he extra late tonight? Is he planning on not coming back?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:352
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, the girls' dorm is full-equipped with air conditioning. Who'd want to come back to this shack? Appo's pulled a smooth move.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:355
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Do you really think so?\n"
"Now try imagining Fuusen's face...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:357
msgid "I tried to picture her face in my mind."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:366
msgid "I nearly threw up."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:368
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, she's not mine. But man, love is nice. It comes with air conditioning.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:373
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Yeah. I'd love to shack up in a girl's room.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:376
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Especially on a sweltering night like tonight. Want to take another bath?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:377
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yeah, might as well wash off a bit.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:380
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Then let's go.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:383
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Wait a minute. Someone's coming.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:384
msgid "As usual, Daigo was sensitive to the noise."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:385
msgid "Two seconds later..."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:387
msgid "*KNOCK KNOCK*"
msgstr ""

#: 02206:388

#: 02206:389
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Harucchi, it's an emergency!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:390
msgid "It was Sakura. She sounded like there was trouble."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:391
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I've got a bad feeling about this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:394
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"

msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Are you guys there!?\n"
"We need to hurry!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:396
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 02206:402
msgid "Sakura jumped into our room as soon as Daigo opened the door, and grabbed me by the hand."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:403
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Come with me!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:413
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Sakura-chan, where are we going?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:414
msgid "Pierre and Daigo shoved their heels into their shoes and followed us as well."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:419
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Just follow me! It's Rei-chan!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:420
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Rei-chan...you mean Andou?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:426
msgid "Pierre and I glanced at each other. We were just talking about her a few hours ago."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:429
msgid "We ran as fast as we could as Sakura led me by the hand."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:436
msgid "Sakura brought us to the girls' dorm. Big Andou was crouching down on the floor."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:443
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Here they are.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:444

msgstr ""

#: 02206:450
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Thanks for coming to help, guys.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:451

msgstr ""

#: 02206:464
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Well, you see... Rei-chan...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:465
msgid "I glanced over at Andou. Fuusen was rubbing her back, and she looked on the verge of tears."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:470
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Rei snuck into the teachers' room.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:471
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"The teachers' room? Why?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:475
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"She tried to steal the questions for the upcoming exams...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:476
msgid "I guess her nervous tone was because she only heard hearsay. Sakura glanced at Fuusen seeking her explanation. I guess Fuusen knew the story."
msgstr ""

#: 02206:480
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"It's so silly. She tried to steal the questions and place the blame on you guys.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:481
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Us?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:487
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Stealing the test questions? That's terrible. I guess it does look like something we'd do, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:488
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Why would you do that, though?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02206:489
msgid "I thought we were finally starting to get along fine with the girls."

#: 02206:496
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 02206:497

msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"

msgstr ""
