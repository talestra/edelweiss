msgstr ""

#: 00826:159
msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Got it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00826:162

msgstr ""

#: 00826:184
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00826:220

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? Is that so... The goddess of alchemy?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00826:230
msgid ""
"The principal was still smiling.\n"
"I'm not sure if she just had a jab at my failure or if she's serious about the goddess effect."

#: 00826:231
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
