msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see......\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:16
msgid "My voice cracked. Of course I was hesitating. This was just like a date."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:17
msgid "Uh-oh, once I focused on that, I started getting nervous."

#: 10101:55
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Hey, Kazushi-kun, what's your family like?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:65
msgid "Her eyes grew wide in delight. But sadly, there's not much to my family to cause anybody delight, though."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:66
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"There's not much to say, really. My family's pretty ordinary. We live in a small house that my grandpa built.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:69
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"You've got a grandpa?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:70
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 10101:74
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"How about your family?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:75
msgid "I know her grandmother is our principal, but I don't know anything about the rest of her family."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:76
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Right now it's just me and grandma. Not that it matters, since I live in the dorms. My parents are in Tokyo.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:77
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh, they are? You're living away from them?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:78
msgid ""
"I didn't know her family, really.\n"
"She'd never told me about her parents before."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:79
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"It's because of my dad's job.\n"
"I stayed here because I wanted to.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:80
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Your dad's job? Isn't he an alchemist too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:81
msgid ""
"It was only natural to think so.\n"
"Haruka shook her head though, and smiled."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:84
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"My dad's a run of the mill salaryman. My mom's a housewife. They have nothing to do with alchemy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:85
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is that right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:86
msgid "I thought her whole family would have been alchemists, but it turns out that wasn't the case."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:87
msgid "Not like back in the day, I guess that alchemists have a freedom to choose alternative occupations nowadays."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:90
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"My father didn't get along with grandma. He thinks that alchemy is old-fashioned and shady.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:91
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I can believe that some people would think that way.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:92
msgid "Well, more than some people. That may actually be the popular opinion regarding alchemy in general - I know it's how I first thought about it."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:95
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"And yet that father majored in pharmaceutics and works as a researcher for a pharmaceutical company. It doesn't seem all that different to me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:96
msgid "Her smile seemed a bit sad. She must have been caught between her father and her grandma. And yet Haruka chose..."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:97
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But you chose to stay here and pursue the path of alchemy, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:98
msgid "That's why she's here, away from her parents."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:101
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I've always admired my grandma, ever since I was little.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:102
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"The principal?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:103
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Yep.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:104
msgid "She turned around, taking in the white flowers that surrounded us. They were beautiful, like a field of snowflakes. She looked around, cherishing the tiny flowers."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:107
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I believe I told you about this before...\n"
"My grandparents met on this island.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:108
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yeah, you did. And this flower garden is their special place.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:109
msgid ""
"We destroyed the flower beds when we first arrived.\n"
"This is where Haruka's grandpa proposed to the principal."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:112
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Even though he died a long time ago and I don't know much about him, they're my ideal couple.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:113
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Even though you don't know much about him?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:114
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"My grandma always told me stories about him while I was growing up. Whenever she talks about him, she becomes really happy and beautiful.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:117
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"That's why I'm convinced that they had such a magical time together. I've always dreamed of having a romance like theirs.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:118
msgid "She talked about it as if it was the epitome of her dreams and fantasies. It made me smile, imagining the principal as a young and beautiful girl."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:119
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's why you stayed here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:122
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"That too. I wanted to help my grandma with her research as well, but...\n"
"...I don't know anymore.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:123
msgid "Haruka became quiet. She pulled some grass and weeds out of the ground, and threw them into the air."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:124
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Were you arguing with the principal earlier?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:125
msgid ""
"I tried to say it as nonchalantly as possible.\n"
"Haruka didn't answer me."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:126
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's only natural to have arguments with your family sometimes. My parents and I never agree on anything, and you should see the way I fight with my little sister sometimes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:127
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"It's little different from fighting.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:128
msgid ""
"Haruka selected her words to fit around mine.\n"
"She looked a bit worried."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:129
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"How is it different from fighting?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:130
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Well...\n"
"If it's a fight, you can always make up later, but I don't think that's going to happen this time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:131
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is it that serious?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:134
msgid "Haruka nodded her head with a serious face."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:135
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I can't agree with the way she's doing things.\n"
"I don't believe in making sacrifices in order to achieve something.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:136
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Especially when it means a lot to me......\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:137
msgid ""
"She tightly clenched her fists in rage.\n"
"She must be seriously angry at the principal."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:138
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What exactly did she do?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:139
msgid "It's hard to imagine that the Principal would do something that unforgivable. And for what?"
msgstr ""

#: 10101:142
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Kazushi-kun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:143
msgid "Haruka held my hands in hers. She gripped them tightly and looked straight into my eyes. I'd never seen her so desperate before."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:144
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Alchemy in itself is not evil. If you use it correctly, it will help us. It all depends on how it's used.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:145
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I want you to know that, no matter what.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:146
msgid "Her words sounded like a prayer. They entered my body and diffused themselves out to every edge of my body."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:147
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Please......\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:148
msgid "Her giant eyes were about to suck me in. They seemed capable of taking me to a different world."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:149
msgid "She didn't have to ask me like this. My answer for her has already been decided."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:150
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I trust you, Haruka.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:153
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"You do?\n"
"I'm so glad!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:154
msgid "She seemed so relieved that she couldn't help romping around the garden like a child. It made me happy that my small words could provide her with so much comfort."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:157
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Oh hey!\n"
"What do you want to do most right now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:158
msgid ""
"She looked me in the eyes with delight in her own.\n"
"Her face was so close, it made me shy."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:159
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well......\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:160
msgid ""
"I wasn't prepared to answer that question.\n"
"I looked up to the sky and saw white clouds swimming overhead."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:161
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I might want to fly in the sky.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:162
msgid "Haruka looked up in the sky, following my eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:164
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I wish I could fly like those clouds in the sky. I've always dreamed of flying, ever since I was a little kid - I even hurt myself when I spread out a sheet and leapt from a tree once.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:166
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"The sky......\n"
"I like that!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:168
msgid ""
"Haruka leapt to her feet.\n"
"She pulled me up as well."

msgstr ""

#: 10101:172
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 10101:173
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 10101:174
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"...huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:179
msgid "Haruka took me to the experiment ward instead of the sky."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:182
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Nnngh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:183
msgid "Haruka stared into the fire under her flask."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 10101:187
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I'm going to make you fly!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:188
msgid "She said it so easily."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:189
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Can you do that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:192
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"We can through alchemy. They say even levitation is possible with a Philosopher's Stone.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:193
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Philosopher's stone?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:194
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Of course, we can't make that, but we don't need something that effective now. After all, it only takes a little extra in order to fly.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:195
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"For an instance......a bird's wings.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:196
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wings......?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:200
msgid "Both of my arms had been draped with wings made from bird's feathers stiffened with wax."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:201
msgid "Why did she have these things? And before my eyes lay the cliff."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:202
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 10101:205
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"That's right!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:206
msgid ""
"She gave me a big smile.\n"
"When we first arrived on the island, there was still water along the cliff's edge, but not anymore."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:207
msgid "I looked down. If I fail, I will die......"
msgstr ""

#: 10101:208
msgid "My knees were shaking with fear."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:209
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Don't worry.\n"
"We'll be adding power to those wings using alchemy.\n"

"{Haruka}\n"

"Here, watch.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:214
msgid "She poured the solution that she just made in the lab onto the wings."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:220
msgid "They shined for a second. Even less - a split second."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:221
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"There, now you can fly.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:222
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wait a minute.\n"
"Don't you think that was a weak reaction?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:223
msgid "I'd been witness to alchemy in action a few times after moving to this island, but I may not have had enough experience to be able to tell."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:224
msgid "But as far as I knew, that still seemed weak to me."
msgstr ""

#: 10101:225
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I'm sure it's fine. I did it the same way I always do.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

"Let me go first!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:234
msgid ""
"I snatched the wings back from Haruka.\n"

"I got it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10101:245
