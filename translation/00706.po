msgid "{Yagami}\n\"And on the test, I'll be sure to ask you to describe the author's sentiments in 20 words or less.\""

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Wow!\nThanks for telling us!\""

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"I like male teachers, he's so open. Oh, gotta jot it down...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:17

msgid "However, there was still a big gap between the girls and the boys. No one's been brave enough to bridge the divide yet."

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:23

msgid "The biggest gulf between the sexes would be right here, between me and Mizuki."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:24

msgid "I sat right next to Hinata-san, but I hadn't talked to her for a while."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:30

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Alright, that's it for today. Make sure you study the parts I told you will be on the test. If you get them wrong, be ready for me to swing the whip of love.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:36

msgid "{Andou}\n\"I don't think I'd mind sensei whipping me...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:37

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Oh? Is he your type, Rei?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:38

msgid "{Andou}\n\"I like men who are strong and manly. Especially a fighter...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:39

msgid "Andou gave Yagami-sensei a seductive look. I think that's the first time I ever saw him shudder in fear."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:44

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"...goodbye!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:52

msgid "Yagami-sensei shot out from the classroom. Some of the girls were even chasing after him - he was getting really popular."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:53

msgid "On the other hand..."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:56

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:57

msgid "While the rest of the class was carrying on, there wasn't a single word being shared over here. It was clear that she didn't want to talk to me."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:58

msgid "What did I do wrong?"
msgstr ""

#: 00706:59

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:60

msgid "I can't think of anything!\nI'll just ask her!"
msgstr ""

#: 00706:61

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hey, Hinata-san...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:64

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"What do you want!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:65

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I just......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:66

msgid "All I did was speak to her. What did get so upset with me?"
msgstr ""

#: 00706:67

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Why do you act like you're on constant alert around me? You don't need to be that stiff.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:70

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I'm not being wary of you. This is how I am.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:71

msgid "So she said, but I could still feel the wall and the distance between us."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:72

msgid "Our desks may be attached, but her chair was as far away as it could be, and she always sat with her back turned to me, leaning away from me."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:73

msgid "Sometimes she'd look at me to see if I was looking at her. What did she want?"
msgstr ""

#: 00706:80

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"What? Mizuki, don't you like sitting next to Haruma-kun?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:81

msgid "Even Takase turned back to make fun of her for it. Honestly, Takase was right. It was hard to think she didn't hate being near me."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:84

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"It's not that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:85

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"It doesn't seem like it. Hinata-san, have I done something wrong to you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:88

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"W-what? Did you do something? Do you have any idea what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:89

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I don't think so.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:90

msgid "The only connection we have is sitting next to each other, and I don't think we've talked enough for me to upset her."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:93

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Then you haven't done anything, have you? I don't remember anything.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:94

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You sure? It seems like there's something?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:97

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Right? Mizuki is oddly cold to you, Haruma-kun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:98

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Right? So you agree, Takase?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:101

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Uh-huh. Definitely.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:102

msgid "I was suddenly hitting it off with Takase. Hinata-san heaved a sigh in amazement at us."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:105

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Well don't you two get along. When did you become such good friends?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:108

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Well, we're Haruma and Sakura, right? Don't cherry blossoms fit right in with spring?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:109

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You're right! We have good chemistry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:112

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Exactly. I wonder if I could call you 'Harucchi' from now on? Do you mind?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:113

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Not at all! Then Takase, do you mind if I call you Sakura?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:114

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Oh, nice. By my first name, huh? Good, good. It feels exciting to have a boy call me by my first name.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:115

msgid "We were having a great chat over just our names. Takase...I mean Sakura was so cheerful and friendly, she was real easy to talk to."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:116

msgid "She's one of the few girls I can actually chat openly with."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:117

msgid "But it's more like hanging with the guys. There's no sexual atmosphere between us."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:120

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I didn't know you were so good at handling boys, Sakura.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:123

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"I don't like the way you say that. I was in co-ed schools up through middle school, so I'm just normal. The same should go for you, Mizuki.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:126

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Yeah, but I chose to come to an all girls' school. I'm not very happy that they made it co-ed all of a sudden.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:127

msgid "She looked really bitter. I kind of knew it, but I guess we boys weren't welcome here."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:130

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Mizuki, you hate boys? Really? I didn't know. Then I guess you like girls, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:133

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Huh? Wait, what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:134

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Do you mean THAT?! Is Hinata-san a- a lesbian?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:137

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Who said I am!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:138

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I get it now. Hinata-san's a lesbian. Why do you prefer girls over guys? You're so cute, Hinata-san that it's a total waste.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:141

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"...!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:144

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"He says you're cute. Good for you, Mizuki.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:147

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Shut up!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:148

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"But if you ask me, I think it's more natural for girls to be with guys. If you'd like, I can introduce you to a few good ones?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:149

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I don't need that!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:154

msgid "She stood up so fast her chair hit the ground and she stormed out of the classroom."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:155

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Did I say something wrong?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:158

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Harucchi, you can't read between the lines, can you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:159

msgid "Sakura was almost doubled up from laughing for some reason."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:160

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I was trying to be considerate?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:163

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Harucchi, you don't understand how we girls think. Maybe this is how you caused her to hold a grudge? You probably just don't realize it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:164

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You think so?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:165

msgid "I must have. Otherwise, why would things be so strained between us?"
msgstr ""

#: 00706:166

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I can't just leave the matter open. We're stuck sitting next to each other.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:174

msgid "{Appo}\n\"You worry too much.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:175

msgid "My buddies came to see me."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:176

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Do you guys have any good ideas to help me get along with her?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:179

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Think about it. What's tomorrow?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:180

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Tomorrow?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:181

msgid "Tomorrow is Saturday......"
msgstr ""

#: 00706:182

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Tomorrow's a half day. Want to do something in the afternoon?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:183

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Come on, what is happening that afternoon?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:184

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Afternoon? We already made plans?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:187

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"What, you forgot?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:190

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Hey guys, what do you think I should wear? A suit?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:193

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Quit giving off such an air of grief. Your normal jersey is fine.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:196

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Your jersey is your battle suit!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:197

msgid "All three of them were very excited. Daigo was even getting nervous. What's happening tomorrow?"
msgstr ""

#: 00706:198

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'm too tired to guess.\nJust tell me what's going on tomorrow.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:205

msgid "They all gave me looks of pity like I was some poor fool."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:206

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Huh? You seriously forgot? What the hell, are you an idiot?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:207

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What do you mean? You're an idiot yourself! Anyways, what's happening tomorrow?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:210

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"God! You honestly forgot?! Kazushi, you're hopeless.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:213

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"That's why we need to look after him.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:214

msgid "They seriously looked shocked. Am I really an idiot?"
msgstr ""

#: 00706:220

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"I guess Harucchi really forgot. I was rather looking forward to it too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:221

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You too, Sakura?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:226

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Sakura-chan, please inform this idiot what happens tomorrow.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:229

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Oh well, let me enlighten you. Tomorrow we're having a welcoming party for you boys.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:230

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Welcoming party?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:231

msgid "..............."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:232

msgid "........................"
msgstr ""

#: 00706:233

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh yeah!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:237

msgid "{Appo}\n\"How could you forget!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:238

msgid "I finally remembered Mei-sensei telling us something about that."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:239

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"You should at least make sure to keep track of big events like this. Girls love special events.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:243

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Like the anniversary of when you first met, the anniversary of when you first looked at each other, the anniversary of when you first talked, the anniversary of when you first held hands, the anniversary of when you first kissed, the anniversary of when you first screwed...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:245

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"They're that detailed?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:246

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Girls turn every occasion into an anniversary, and they'll never forgive you if you forget.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:247

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Are you serious? I don't think I'll be able to date a girl...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:251

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"They love romance.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:252

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Even you knew that, Daigo......?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:257

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Are you sure that's just not your delusion?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:258

msgid "Ran wasn't about to let that blanket statement pass."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:259

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I have yet to meet a girl like that. I don't care about any of those things, either.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:264

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Why not?! Care about them! They're important aren't they?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:268

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"I could never remember all those dates and details.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:271

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Right? See?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:272

msgid "Looks like we men were more romantic. Either way, there's a welcoming party tomorrow."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:273

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You think there'll be something good to eat at the party?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:278

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Stupid, that's not what matters! The girls are doing this to welcome us! It's our chance to get closer to them!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:282

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I hate to be the one to say this, but I don't think you should get your hopes up?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:283

msgid "She looked sorry to tell us that."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:284

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Isn't the mood between the guys and the girls kind of edgy right now? Attendance is mandatory, so I doubt any of them are going to sincerely welcome you guys.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:289

msgid "{Appo}\n\"I wish you hadn't told me that. I was finally starting to feel good.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:292

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I thought you'd be hurt less if you faced reality.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:295

msgid "{Appo}\n\"We can at least dream! Let a man dream!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:299

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"But maybe this event will be a trigger to help the boys and girls get along better in the future.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:300

msgid "{Ran}\n\"You're right. I've got a great idea for something you can do tomorrow.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:304

msgid "{Appo}\n\"You have some kind of plan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:307

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I do, I do. Of course I do. I know a technique you can use to snag their hearts!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:314

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"How much!? How much do you want!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:315

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hold it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:316

msgid "I hated to intrude on Pierre and Ran's excitement, but I didn't like where this was going."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:321

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What's wrong?\nDon't you want to be popular?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:322

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'd love to be, if that were possible, but I think this is something we should work out by ourselves.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:323

msgid "Right now there was a huge social gap between the boys and the girls."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:324

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"We need to wipe away our past disgrace with our own hands.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:325

msgid "We shouldn't be thinking about what kind of results to expect from the welcoming party, but rather the road to follow to get along with the girls."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:333

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Here he goes, pretending to be a good guy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:334

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"That's our Kazushi.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:335

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Well, I guess if that's how you feel, Kazushi. You're up for it, right Appo?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:338

msgid "{Appo}\n\"For crying out loud. Kazushi is useless without us.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:339

msgid "Ran gave us a quizzical look."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:345

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Hmm? You guys have a pretty strange relationship.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:350

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"It's hard for a girl to understand.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:351

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"All right! We'll find our own way to wipe away our past disgrace!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:354

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Let's redeem our honor!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:357

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Ahaha, sounds like failure's in store. Well, good luck.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:362

msgid "Here we are, holding a strategy meeting."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:369

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"So, what we should do?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:370

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Something the girls will like?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:373

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Like what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:376

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"......how about proposing?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:377

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"If their lovers did that, they might be happy, but definitely not if we did.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:380

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"But I hear that girls go along with the mood. We could invite them out to a romantic, tear-jerking spot...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:381

msgid "{Appo}\n\"The g-spot?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:386

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"That is the name of a spot, but they'd kill you for mentioning it, Appo.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:389

msgid "{Appo}\n\"I've heard that girls cry for joy when you go to their g-spot.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:390

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"You read way too many how-to manuals, Appo.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:391

msgid "I'm glad we were finally trying to clear our names, but we didn't have a clue as to how we'd do it. We'd never done anything that made girls happy."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:394

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Hey, Pierre! You give us a decent plan! You always say you know everything about girls, don't you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:397

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"I know, but...something they'd like... How about a surprise?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:398

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"That's a good start.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:401

msgid "{Appo}\n\"So surprise them with something shocking? Or startle them? I bet they'd be stunned if they woke up with us lying naked next to them.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:404

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"That's just a crime.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:407

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Not that kind of surprise......how about presents?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:412

msgid "{Boys}\n\"Presents!!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:413

msgid "That was a revelation to us all. Of course, presents can make a girl happy. That's always in dramas and such."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:414

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Wait, I forgot. I don't have any money.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:415

msgid "Ran took it all away from me, and now I can barely afford my own lunch."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:418

msgid "{Appo}\n\"I'm thinking about it carefully, but I can't come up with anything that we can get ahold of that the girls would like on this island.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:421

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"What kind of thing would they want, anyways?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:422

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Designer items? Jewellery? Something with value.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:423

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"They're definitely not selling those here. And we couldn't afford them if they did.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:426

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Hey, Daigo, can't you fake up some designer bags with your workman's hands?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:429

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Impossible.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:434

msgid "I thought we'd stumbled upon a great idea but were at a dead end already. What do we do now?"
msgstr ""

#: 00706:437

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Pierre, give us a plan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:438

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Me again......?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:439

msgid "After a few seconds, he came up with a great idea."
msgstr ""

#: 00706:442

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Why don't we ask them?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:443

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I guess we'll have to. It'll ruin the surprise, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00706:444

msgid "I wonder who I should be asking?"
