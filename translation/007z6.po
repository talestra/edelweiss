msgstr ""

#: 007z6:263

msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 007z6:273

msgstr ""

#: 007z6:281
msgid ""
"{Yagami}\n"
"\"No, she's still asleep. It seems to have been quite the shock.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:282
msgid "Yagami-sensei answered carefully. For once, he was on our side. He had no idea what happened either."
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:285
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"

msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"

#: 007z6:303
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Well, we picked all of the Principal's precious flowers from her garden, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:304
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"We did that at our last school too, though. We completely ruined that flower garden, and they were really mad, but...\""
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:305
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"All it took was a few letters of apology.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:306
msgid "This was on a completely different level. Why was everyone so tense about it?"
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:312
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You guys should go back to your dorm.\n"
"You'll hear from the principal tomorrow.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:313
msgid "Mei-sensei's concern made us really worried. We were finally adjusting to our lives here. What'll happen to us now?"
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:318
msgid "I couldn't sleep, so I went back to that place. Someone was already there though."
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:321
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 007z6:329
msgid "I could tell that we had done something horrible to this land."
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:330
msgid "The place looked like it had been hit by a typhoon."
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:331
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"This place must have been very special to the principal.\n"
"I'll go and apologize to her tomorrow.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm not sure if she'll forgive me, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:333

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 007z6:339
msgid "The importance of that slowly sank in."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I didn't know that this place meant so much to her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:341

msgstr ""

#: 007z6:342
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"The knowledge of this magical island has been passed down for generations amongst my grandma's family.\""

msgstr ""

#: 007z6:352
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Yeah, I wish I knew...\""
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:358
msgid "She couldn't think of any ideas and hung her head. We'd gotten ourselves into worse trouble than we were ready for."
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:359
msgid "This might be the end of our stay on this island."
msgstr ""

#: 007z6:362
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
