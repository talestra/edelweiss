"{Fuusen}\n"

#: 10401:55
msgid "I could hear everything they were whispering. I know they were trying to hide and peek in on me, but it was plain to see."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:56
msgid "Still it felt good. It made me feel at ease to listen to them and know that they were watching over me."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Haruka...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:58
msgid "I cried like an idiot and felt better, but I also felt depressed again."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:59
msgid "The fact that Haruka was gone still hadn't changed."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"............\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:61
msgid "There was still a faint trace of Haruka's scent left on her bed. It was so faint that I doubt anyone else would notice it."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:62
msgid "And this faint scent too will disappear soon."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:63
msgid "I haven't gotten much sleep lately, so it shouldn't be difficult for me to fall asleep with my eyes closed. But for some reason, I can't sleep at all."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:64
msgid "I'm afraid of sleeping. If I go to sleep, I'll have to wake up to a world where Haruka's not around."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:65
msgid "When I woke, that would be the first thing I realized, and I'd be in despair again. I wouldn't want to wake up anymore. And that scared me."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ahh, Haruka...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:72
msgid "Haruka had melted away. It must have been an illusion my nearly-crazy mind created."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:73
msgid "But this is how things should be: A world without Haruka."

#: 10401:74
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I guess you won't stay by my side, will you Haruka?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:75
msgid "I was becoming enveloped in despair. It felt like I was falling into a deep, bottomless pit, and I was terrified."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:76
msgid "But I'm not falling anymore. Everyone else is here, supporting me."

msgstr ""

#: 10401:89
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:90
msgid "I promised I'd go with her, that I would take Haruka off of this island and we would travel the broad world together."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:91
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"We need to earn some money first. Then once I have my driver's license, and we have more money stored up, then...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:92
msgid "I felt like there was still a lot to prepare. I only had a vague idea before, but after meeting Haruka, it's grown more tangible."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:93
msgid "Yet that only made it seem more unrealistic in my mind. I didn't even have a good idea of what else needed to be prepared."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:94
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It looks like it's going to take some time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:97
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I see. It will take a lot of money, won't it? But if we both work hard, it won't take long.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:98
msgid "Haruka was skipping with excitement, even though all we did was reaffirm our distant goal."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You look so happy, Haruka.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:102
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Yes, I am. Because now I have a goal to achieve. No, it's more of a dream.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:103
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"A dream? You make it sound like you've never had one before.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:104
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Well, no. I haven't, really.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:105
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Really? What about becoming an alchemist, like the principal?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:106
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"That was more real than a dream I guess. I studied every day, and it was just the result of that. So it didn't really feel like a dream.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:107
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, yeah?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:110
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Oh, yes. And...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:111
msgid "Suddenly, Haruka's tone fell."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:114
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"It was all more, 'I have to do this,' rather than 'it would be nice to do this.' It was the same with my grandma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:117
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"But then I met you, Kazushi-kun, and I finally though 'it would be nice to do this someday.' That's why every day is so much fun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:118
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's fun for me too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:119
msgid "I never really thought about the fact that every day was fun before I met Haruka. That's all different now, though."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:120
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I'm happy today, and looking forward to tomorrow too. Because today, tomorrow, and the day after will all lead to that 'someday'.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:123
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"You're the one who showed me that dream, Kazushi-kun. No, you've become my dream.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:124
msgid ""
"Her shining eyes looked straight at me.\n"
"What beautiful, bright eyes they are!"
msgstr ""

#: 10401:125
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You're embarrassing me!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:128
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Ahaha. Sorry. I'm embarrassed too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:129
msgid "Haruka fidgeted, her cheeks flushed, and I blushed too. The sea breeze gently caressed our warm cheeks."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:132
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Let's go some day. You and me. Promise?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:133
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

#: 10401:143
msgid "I woke up with a hint of Haruka's sweet scent in my nose."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:144
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"...............A dream, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:145
msgid "A dream about just one month ago, when we were happy. Every day was fun, and we couldn't wait for tomorrow. A complete 180 from today."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:146
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Our promise, huh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:147
msgid "I'll take you off this island. I'll introduce you to my family. We'll go on a journey together......"
msgstr ""

#: 10401:148
msgid "Haruka had been looking forward to all of that, and yet I couldn't make her dream come true."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:149
msgid "Is it impossible to fulfill my promises to her now? What can I even do for her now?"
msgstr ""

#: 10401:154
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So beautiful.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:155
msgid "With all of those white flowers blooming at once, it looked like a pure white carpet. The flowers that rarely bloom were blooming everywhere, just like when I first met Haruka."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:156
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"This is so amazing, isn't it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:157
msgid "I heard someone's softly surprised voice."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:160
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sensei.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:161
msgid "It was the principal. She walked through the flowers to come towards me."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:162
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"They are very special flowers. It's not easy to get them bloom like this, even when you try to make them. But your friends did it quite simply.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:163
msgid "Haruka also said these white flowers were very special."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:164
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"They're all incredible guys.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:165
msgid "While I wandered through the darkness, they made sure to protect the flowers Haruka cherished. And they even pulled me back off the wrong path."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:166
msgid "I have so much respect for them."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:169
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"By seeing these flowers, I can tell how much and how earnestly they love you and Haruka.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:170
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Haruka was a very lucky girl to have friends like them.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:171
msgid "The principal quietly stared at the blooming flowers, her eyes full of regret for the things she never noticed before."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:174
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"I should have paid more attention to her. My eyes were completely clouded.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:175
msgid "The principal chuckled a bit. I knew she was blaming herself."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:176
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Please don't blame yourself.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:177
msgid "I knew how the principal felt. I would have continued on the same path as hers had I been alone."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:178
msgid "However, my friends were there for me, just as Haruka had been there for the principal."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:179
msgid "But now Haruka was gone."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:182
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"I'm okay......It's just started sinking in that I'm now completely alone.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:183
msgid "The principal smiled warmly, yet sadly. I never knew that she could smile like that, and my heart ached to see such a gentle smile on her exhausted face."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:184
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But you have a son, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:185
msgid "Her son - Haruka's father. He must have come to the funeral, but I didn't get to see him since I couldn't bring myself to go to the ceremony."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:188
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"I fear that I have lost contact with him completely after this tragedy. He's never liked alchemy to begin with. Maybe he genuinely hates it now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:189
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm sorry to hear that...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:190
msgid "He'd reluctantly let Haruka come to this academy because it was Haruka's only wish to learn alchemy. But when this was the result, who would blame him."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:191
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Everyone in my family has left me. Maybe this is a punishment from god.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:192
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No, please don't say that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:193
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Well, being alone may not be as bad as I think. Besides, there's nobody left in my family to lose.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:194
msgid "Her eyes told me that the principal had given up on everything. Haruka wouldn't have wanted to see her grandma like this. I couldn't just leave her alone..."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:195
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Then...\n"
"I will become your grandson!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:198
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"What? You...my grandson?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:199
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Why not? I was planning to be, anyways. I was very serious about being with Haruka.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:200
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"No, that's crazy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:201
msgid "The principal was speechless in surprise, but I was dead serious."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:202
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yes, it may sound crazy. But so what? Can you just think of me as your real grandson?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:203
msgid "I couldn't leave the principal by herself to wallow in her loneliness. That's not what Haruka wanted."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:206
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"...pft.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:207
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:208
msgid "What's so funny? The principal was trying to suppress her laughter."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:209
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Excuse me, principal... Can I be...your grandson...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:210
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself. I can see why Haruka liked you so much.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:211
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, yeah...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:212
msgid "But is it really that funny?"
msgstr ""

#: 10401:213
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"I wish I was ten years younger...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:214
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ten years younger?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:215
msgid "The principal chuckled mischievously. Is she teasing me? Is this really the same principal?"
msgstr ""

#: 10401:216
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Thank you, Haruma-kun. I really mean it. Your kindness really touches me. I'm happy just to have those sentiments.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:217
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Why just the sentiments? Regardless of what you say, I will be your grandson eventually.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:220
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"You will be?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:223
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I haven't given up on Haruka yet.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:224
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"What? But that's...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:225
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 10401:226
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 10401:227
msgid "The principal looked surprised and confused."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:230
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"My apprentice? Do you mean you want to become an alchemist?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:231
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I didn't say I wanted to become your grandson on a whim. I have decided to study alchemy for the rest of my life.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:232
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"But...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:233
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Please!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:234
msgid "I bowed deeply. The principal looked perplexed."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:235
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Please raise your head.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:236
msgid "The principal lowered her head to look directly into my face."

#: 10401:237
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Are you trying to take Haruka's place?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:238

msgstr ""

#: 10401:239
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 10401:240
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No, that's not the reason. I'm asking this because it's what I want to do.\""

msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Are you sure?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:242
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 10401:243
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I will take all the classes and study as hard as possible, so please teach me alchemy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:244
msgid "I've never asked anyone to teach me something so desperately. But now, I simply want to know more about alchemy, the subject Haruka dedicated her life to."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:245
msgid "The principal sighed deeply and smiled a bit."

msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Really!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:252
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Of course. Though teaching may be a misnomer - studying together may be closer to the truth.\""

msgid "The principal gazed out and took in the carpet of flowers in full bloom."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:256
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"

msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"I studied so hard in order to catch up with my husband. I loved what I was doing and enjoyed myself very much, but I forgot about those feelings for a long time.\""

msgid "The principal looked as though she were reminiscing about the good old days. She smiled happily."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:261
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"I know how you feel about studying alchemy. I felt the same way. I want to get those feelings back.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:262
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"So I won't say that I'm going to be teaching you. Rather, I want to study together with you, Haruma-kun. Is that okay?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:263
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yes, of course!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10401:264

#: 10401:273
msgid "It was like this, in the middle of these blooming flowers, that I met Haruka for the first time."
msgstr ""

#: 10401:274
