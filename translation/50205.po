#: 50205:30

#: 50205:31
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I guess you really don't remember it. Hahh... maybe I didn't teach you well.\""

msgstr ""

#: 50205:40
msgid "Her tone suddenly dropped."

#: 50205:41

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh... so you were the one who laid me in bed.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:61

#: 50205:62
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You were sleeping with your face on the table. So, I picked you up like this, and carried you like a princess......\""

msgstr ""

#: 50205:67
msgid "Wh-what was the weird sound? Did it come from sensei?"
msgstr ""

#: 50205:70
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What have I done?! Showing my defenseless side in front of my student... How could I be so careless?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:71
msgid "She held her head in her hands. I felt bad saying this, but watching Mei-sensei like that was quite a show."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:72
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, perhaps because I'm not your student right now. Maybe that's why?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:75
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Yes, I know that was the agreement, but... still... did you look at my face while I slept?\""

#: 50205:80
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hhhhhiiiii!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:81

#: 50205:84
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's already irregular for me to not have any make-up on, and on top of that he saw me while I slept...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:85
msgid "She was mumbling something to herself in shock. ...She's funny."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, what happened yesterday is a fact.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:92
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"But I'm usually the type who's too worried to sleep when people are around. For me to sleep so defenselessly... you didn't slip in a sleeping pill, did you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:93
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No, no, please don't go there.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:96
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"No, maybe Kazushi-kun is my sleeping pill? My tranquilizer? No, that's just silly.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:97
msgid "She was saying some embarrassing things. I could tell she was quite confused."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sensei, just calm down.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:101
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Huh? Yes, of course I'm calm. I have to calm down and eat my meal. If I didn't eat, I'd just be a lump of meat.\""

msgstr ""

#: 50205:130
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yeah, sort of. I'm so tired now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:131
msgid "I went back to my room before around five o'clock last night, and I got up before eight this morning, so I slept less than three hours."

msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"H-how did you know about that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:144
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"We share the same room, so I can tell. When I got up to take a piss at night you weren't there. Then you were back by morning.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:148
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Seriously? Then that means...\""

msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50205:156
msgid ""

#: 50205:162
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"N-nothing happened. Really.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:163
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"She's right! Nothing like that happened...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:171
msgid "The three of them gave us cold stares as we desperately made excuses. It felt like the more heat was put on us, the colder their eyes grew..."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:174
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Ohh, I see. So you two were together last night then.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:175
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Grk!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:178
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Man, I was half-joking. I didn't think I'd hit a bull's-eye.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:184
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Au, au, a, a-about that... Right! I was helping him study all night...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:189
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Private lessons until morning? Way to go, Kazushi. Can't believe tuition's the same.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:190
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Quit being so misleading. Nothing happened - honestly, okay?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:198
msgid "I glared at them to show how serious I was. They got the message and started whispering to each other in surprise."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:201
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Hey, looks like he's serious.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:204
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Yeah, I'm surprised. But it looks they really were together until morning. And nothing happened?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:207
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"It's unbelievable, madam. What does that say about him as a man? I'm sure she was hoping for something too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:213
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Huh? By she you mean me? I wasn't hoping for anything...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:214
msgid "I knew she didn't because she was deep asleep."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:215
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh well. Here, hurry up and finish.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:223
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Yeah, fine, I'll let you off for now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:226
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Well, they have to go at their own pace. I know he's good for nothing, but take care of Kazushi, Mei-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:232
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Huh? I-I'm, look...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:237
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"He's stupid and unreliable, so you might want to take the lead, Mei-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:240
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I'm telling you, we are not...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:244
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Mei-sensei, you're beet red.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:245
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Argh, quit teasing your teacher!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:246
msgid "Even though sensei was mad, everyone else just grinned."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:247
msgid "I can't blame them. Sensei was so totally cute as she got mad in front of everyone."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:254
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh yeah.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:255
msgid "Sensei suddenly stopped on our way back to the library."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:256
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What's wrong?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:259
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I forgot to go shopping, so I'll do it now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:260
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Then, I'll go with you!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:265
msgid "It was quite new to walk the town together with sensei."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:266
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's like we're on a date.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:269
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Don't get carried away.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:270
msgid "Sensei gave me a resolute warning now that she had her pace back. She was so cute when she was flustered, too."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:271
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So, what do you need here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:274
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I need stuff for the class. A great idea came to me, so I wanted to perform an experiment during the summer holiday.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:275
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So instruments for alchemy? Then I guess we're going to that store.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:280
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hello~\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:281
msgid "I could tell sensei had been here often by the friendly greeting she gave."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:286
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Hey, Mei-chan. Welcome. It's been a while.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:287
msgid "The old shopkeeper came out with a smile. I think his name was Miya-san."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:288
msgid "Miya-san looked really happy to see Mei-sensei."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:291
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's been quite a while. I've been pretty busy with converting to co-ed.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:294
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"I'm sure you have. I doubt you're used to dealing with young boys, Mei-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:297
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It really has been nothing but new things.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:298
msgid "I could feel the friendliness in their polite conversation. They might be closer than I thought."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:301
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Oh, you're...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:302
msgid "I guess he remembered my face, even though I only visited here once."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:303
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm Haruma. Good to see you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:304
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Oh, right, right. Haruma Kazushi-kun, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:305
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:308
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh, you two know each other?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:309
msgid "Mei-sensei looked happy, somehow."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:310
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"It's a small island. Before it was just young girls and I had nothing to talk about, but I'm happy to see so many guys here now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:313
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh, you're not very comfortable around girls?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:314
msgid "She spoke teasingly and tauntingly. Miya-san just wore a polite, dry smile."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:317
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"An old man like me is overwhelmed by the power of young girls.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:320
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh? I didn't think you were you actually that old?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:321
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Oh no, here lately the ol' hips...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:324
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh no, you really are old.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:325
msgid "They had a friendly chat. They must be pretty close."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:326
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Miya-san, you've lived here for a long time, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:327
msgid "I wanted to know about when sensei was still a student. If he's been here since then, he must know about her school days."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:330
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Yeah, I guess. I've been here for over ten years now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:333
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Despite his appearance, he used to be a talented alchemist whom the principal invited to this island.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:334
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? Is that a true story?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:335
msgid "I remembered that Haruka mentioned that once. Miya-san denied it, though."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:336
msgid "I thought she was joking because he didn't look like it at all. He looked more like a mediocre middle-aged man who lost his job because of restructuring."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:339
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Stop that, Mei-chan. If you say things like that, Haruma-kun will believe them.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:340
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? Is it not true?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:343
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh? I didn't think I was lying?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:346
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"No, no, it's a big lie. Yeah, I did dabble in alchemy back in the day, but I had no talent for it and I've cut my ties with it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:347
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:348
msgid "Maybe he was just humbling himself. Otherwise, his story was totally different from sensei's. Sensei just smiled, never interrupting him."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:351
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"But you know I have to make a living, so I opened this shop to at least subsist from. I have no talent, so this was all I had.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:352
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:353
msgid "That's exactly how he seemed, so it made sense. He did have a connection to alchemy, but not enough to call it talent."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:354
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, then you know the principal, don't you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:355
msgid "I remember this morning that the principal warned me not to get involved with Mei-sensei."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:358
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Of course. I at least tried practicing alchemy on this island, so I'd obviously know her. I knew her before I even came to this island, so for about 20 years now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:359
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:360
msgid "This man might know something. If he treats Mei-sensei like a daughter and he's known the principal for a long time, then..."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:364
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What's wrong?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:365
msgid "Mei-sensei peered at me with concern as I became lost in thought. I was worried about what the principal said, but I couldn't ask that in front of her."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:366
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Nothing. Well, what about your shopping?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:369
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh, I almost forgot about it. Can I take a look inside?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:374
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Go right ahead. Help yourself.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:378
msgid "Sensei walked towards the back."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:381
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"Still, it's pretty rare for you to bring a student here, Mei-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:382
msgid "He carefully sized me up."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:383
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is it that rare? But sensei's popular, so it feels like she's always surrounded by people.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:386
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"That's just for show. Alchemists are fundamentally secretive. They don't show all their cards.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:387
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is that right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:388
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"I wonder what changed her mind.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:393
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Excuse me, sir. Don't go giving Kazushi-kun any strange ideas, okay?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:394
msgid "I guess she heard Miya-san, since she glared at us from in back. Miya-san shrugged his shoulders and played dumb."
msgstr ""

#: 50205:397
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"I just said what came to mind.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:400
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I haven't changed my mind at all. I thought it would be a great idea to get a boy's opinion from Kazushi-kun......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:403
msgid ""
"{Miya}\n"
"\"I think that counts as changing your mind.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50205:406
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Well, after all, it's my first time teaching boys. It's a lot different, so I've learned a lot from them.\""
msgstr ""
