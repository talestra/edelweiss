msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:159
msgid "It probably started off as a joke but quickly got out of hand. Ran thrust her hand down my pockets and took out the box before I knew it."

msgid ""
"{Yagami}\n"
"\"So you were planning to!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:191
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 10201:196
msgid ""
"{Yagami}\n"

#: 10201:204
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Harunyan was an eternal virgin in my eyes too...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:205
msgid "Everybody was paying attention to Haruka now. Half of the table was filled with curiosity, and the other half with envy. She seemed quite uncomfortable under their stares."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:206
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm telling you guys, it's not what you think. And I'll say this again for Haruka's honor, but we haven't done anything yet!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:207
msgid "I needed to make it clear to avoid sullying Haruka's reputation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"

#: 10201:221
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I'm glad it's over now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:222
msgid "We received a summons from Yagami-sensei and Mei-sensei. Not only did they scold us, but they also took away my condoms."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:223
msgid "And there we were, finally released from the inferno and alone by ourselves."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:224
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I made a huge mistake, letting Yagami-sensei find out what I had in my pockets.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:227
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"What's that box supposed to be used for, anyways?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:228
msgid "Haruka still doesn't have any idea why this turned out to be such a big deal. I hope she has some concept of what sex is."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:229
msgid "I just hope she doesn't misunderstand and think I'm after her body once she realizes I've been carrying them on me since we first started dating."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:232
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"So what is it for?\n"
"Tell me!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:233
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well...those...were...uh...caramels!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:234
msgid "I lied in an instant."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:237
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Huh? Those are caramels? I would've wanted one then.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:238
msgid "Oh no, she believed me."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:241
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"But wait a minute. Why would Yagami-sensei be so mad about you carrying around a box of caramels?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:242
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ummm...he actually loathes caramels like nothing else.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:245
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"He loathes caramels?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:246
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"A long time ago, his lost his silver tooth to caramels.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:249
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

#: 10201:250
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 10201:251
msgid "I don't think this is going to work."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:252
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sorry, I lied.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:255
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"You lied? What do you mean? He doesn't hate caramels?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:256
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"He doesn't hate caramels. And there weren't any caramels inside the box.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:259
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"There weren't? Then what was it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:260
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That was... part of a bright family project, or rather a tool to ensure unfortunate children aren't born into this world... In other words, a box of condoms.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:263
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Oh......\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:264
msgid "Haruka's face went bright red again. Despite the tension, I was relieved beyond belief that she actually knew what condoms were."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:267
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Kazushi-kun, y-you already had them ready for us?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:268
msgid "All of a sudden, the atmosphere went strange again."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:269
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Actually, Appo gave them to me. I forgot they were there until lunchtime.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:270
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Appo-kun, huh? Umm, actually...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:271
msgid "Haruka took out a fancy looking condom. It wasn't in a box like usual, and didn't even resemble a condom at first glance."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:272
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Haruka, why do you...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:273
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Kazuko-chan gave me this.\n"
"This is a condom as well, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:274
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, Fuusen gave it to you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:275
msgid "That's Fuusen for you. I'm sure she always has one on her. She makes sure she's prepared for those things."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:276
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"She told me to give this to you if you didn't bring one. This is for the thing couples do when they're in love, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:277
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Y-yes it is.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:278
msgid "\"The thing.\" The way she said it was going around in my head. I wonder when we'll do \"the thing\"."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:281
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Is it too early for us?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:282
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I don't know...I think it's OK to do it once we both agree we're ready.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:283
msgid "By the way, I'm always ready."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:284
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I wonder how soon a couple would do it after they started going out...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:285
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Good question. Some couples might do it as soon as they started going out.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:286
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But at the same time, some might hold on for a while, and some might do it before they even start going out proper.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:289
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I see......\n"
"How about you? Do you want to do it soon?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:290
msgid "She glanced at me shyly. That by itself was enough to turn me on."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:291
msgid "And I don't like that aspect of me."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:292
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't worry, I'm not forcing you to.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:294
msgid "I shouldn't have looked that gift horse in the mouth. I would've been absolutely fine prostrating myself on the floor to beg her for it, but I pretended to be cool about it."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:296
msgid "This is all so complicated."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:299
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"No, I don't mind at all...\n"
"It's just that I've always been on this island, so I don't know anything about it...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:301
msgid "There were no guys her age, and although they did occasionally sell weekly women's magazines, I doubt Haruka bought any. She was probably too embarrassed to buy them from the old ladies she knew so well."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:303
msgid "It's natural for whoever grew up on this island to be completely ignorant about the subject in the first place."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:306
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I did ask Kazuko-chan lots of questions the other day, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:307
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You did?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:308
msgid "I wonder what Fuusen taught Haruka......"
msgstr ""

#: 10201:309
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Kazuko-chan was surprised at how little I was able to understand what she said. Like fella-something? Or cunnin-something?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:310
msgid "Haruka didn't even know the names of basic sex acts. It's so like her."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:313
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I'm so afraid I might let you down......\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:314
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You were worried about that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:315
msgid "I never knew she was worried about such things. The fact that she was concerned she might let me down made me want to love her even more."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:316
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You're silly. You didn't have to worry at all.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:319
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"But I heard that it's important for couples to match that way and...sex... not going well drives many couples apart.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:320
msgid "Dammit, Fuusen, you didn't have to go THAT far..."
msgstr ""

#: 10201:321
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 10201:322
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"This is my first time as well. Like you, I'm completely inexperienced.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:323
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"You don't? Then we're equally ignorant?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:324
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's right. And since we're equally ignorant, we can learn about it together, a little bit at a time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10201:325
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"We can? Is that good enough for you?\""
msgstr ""
