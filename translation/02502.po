msgid "Water entered my mouth as I tried to speak. Why did I keep sinking when I was moving my limbs so much?!"
msgstr ""

#: 02502:18

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I didn't tell you to dive! Just crawl! Start with a crawl!\""

msgstr ""

#: 02502:41

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Phew......That was close.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:42

msgstr ""

#: 02502:45

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"This is why I told you! Why can't you listen to me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:46

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Telling someone who can't swim to swim isn't going to work. You have to teach me step by step.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:47

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Really? But doesn't everyone start to swim to keep from dying when they're tossed in water?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:50

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"It's instinctual, isn't it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:51

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Unless you fix that idea, I'm going to keep dying...\""

#: 02502:55

msgid "No, she's scaring me."
msgstr ""

#: 02502:58

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Well this isn't good. At this rate, you'll never be able to swim.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:59

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"My thoughts exactly.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:62

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"All right, one more time!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:65

msgid "Fwwmp!"

msgid "*SPLASH SPLASH*"
msgstr ""

#: 02502:72

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"All right, float!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:73

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Ubblb...D-don't just toss me in!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:74

#: 02502:85

msgid "It was Sakura and Rin."
msgstr ""

#: 02502:89

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Listen girls, he's hopeless.\nHe doesn't even know how to float!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:92

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Of course he doesn't. He can't swim.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:93

msgid "Fujisaki-san was so nice. My battered heart was touched by her kind, embracing words."
msgstr ""

#: 02502:96

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Why are you siding with him? Floating isn't even swimming, it's a natural ability every human has.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:97

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"She is definitely going to kill me......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:101

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Someone with talent like you can't understand how it is for average people.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:105

msgid "{Rin}\n\"They do say the ability to teach is a separate talent.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:109

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I'm not as talented as you guys are saying.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:112

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Yes you are. You hardly had any coaching, and yet you came in second at nationals.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:113

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"At nationals?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:117

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Yup. She came in second at the national junior high swimming competition.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:121

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"That was nothing.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:122

msgid "You have to really be something to call a national event nothing."
msgstr ""

#: 02502:123

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I knew you were a good swimmer, but I didn't know you were that amazing.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:124

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I'm not.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:127

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"And being able to sincerely say she's not is another one of her amazing points.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:128

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"That's true.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:129

msgid "I didn't know she was that amazing. No wonder she'd been getting frustrated at the difference in our level."
msgstr ""

#: 02502:130

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I don't think I deserve a good coach like you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:134

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Are you quitting?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:135

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I just feel bad for you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:136

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I don't.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:137

msgid "She seemed upset that I was trying to quit. I guess teaching me wasn't just for fun to her."
msgstr ""

#: 02502:138

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Are you sure......?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:139

#: 02502:140

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"All right. I appreciate the offer.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:143

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Good, that's the spirt. Then we'll call it a day. We'll start again tomorrow after our Alchemy assignment.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:144

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Right, that's tomorrow.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02502:145
