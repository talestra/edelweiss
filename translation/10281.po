msgstr ""

#: 10281:23
msgid "Exactly what I'd expect from a dream - the story played out just as I wished. But why did she call me \"sensei\"?"

msgstr ""

#: 10281:63
msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid "Haruka turned around, her cheeks bright red. I think she saw everything."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:106
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm up because it's morning. Every morning is like this. They call it morning glory.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:107
msgid "It was really embarrassing to try and explain it. Haruka let out impressed oohs and aahs as she listened to me explain it."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:110
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"But, I think you should put your clothes on soon.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:111
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Th-that's true. Umm, clothes, where...Ah.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:113
msgid "My clothes from last night were neatly folded on the bedside nightstand. Haruka must have done it for me."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:114
msgid "It was such a little thing, but it touched my heart."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:115
msgid "I dressed myself in the clothes she folded for me, feeling like I was in heaven."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:116
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Thanks for waiting.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:119
msgid ""
"She finally turned around to look at me.\n"
"I'm still embarrassed to look straight into her eyes. Everything happened just yesterday, so I can't help it."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:120
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Umm......huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:121
msgid "I noticed something different as I looked around the room. There were signs a burner had been used."

#: 10281:122
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Were you working on something?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:125
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Oh, yeah. Umm...I kind of made this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:126
msgid "Haruka showed me a small bottle with some kind of chemical."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:127
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You refined that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:128
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Uh huh.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:129
msgid "Haruka nodded her head. After a series of failures, she must have finally become successful again."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:132
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"You see, when I woke up this morning, I felt refreshed, as if I'd been reborn. Then, I had a feeling I could make something and...\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:133
msgid "So she gave it a go, and it worked. When you recover from a slump, it's usually very simple."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:134
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So, did you make something?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:137
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Yes, I'm absolutely confident this time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:138
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"...huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:139
msgid "Haruka shows me a smile with full of confidence."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

#: 10281:146
msgid ""
"The wind whooshed by our ears.\n"

msgstr ""

#: 10281:147
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"This is unbelievable!\n"
"We're really flying!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:148
msgid "We were flying on a desk. We may have failed last time with a pair of wings, but today we were flying on a normally non-flying object."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:149
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Are you sure this isn't magic?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:150
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I don't know!\n"
"The only thing I know is that I feel like now, I can do anything!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:151
msgid "Haruka'd gained back all the confidence she'd lost. Her smile told me that she was on top of the world."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:152
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"This is all because of you!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:153
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What!?\n"
"Why!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:154
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I feel your love has made me stronger! Whatever I failed to do in the past, I feel like I can do it now!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:155
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I feel like I was given a new life!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:156
msgid "Watching her look so alive had made me stronger too."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:157
msgid "So long as Haruka was smiling, I didn't need anything else. Her smile made me feel that way."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:158
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"You should try it, too!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:159
msgid "She backed up and yielded her position to me."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:160
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What am I supposed to do......?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:161
msgid "I don't know how to operate a flying desk. There's no handle, accelerator, or brakes."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:162
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Where do you want to go? We can go anywhere we want!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:163
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Anyplace I'd like......\n"
"Let's see......\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:164
msgid "I looked up to the sky. The sun was shining bright and the white clouds were sparkling."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:165
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Even higher......\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:166

#: 10281:167
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oops!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:168
msgid ""
"The desk zoomed straight upwards in a hurry.\n"
"I guess all I have to do is think about where I want to go."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:169
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"This thing is amazing!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:170
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 10281:171
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's unbelievable!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:172
msgid "I felt like we could fly anywhere we wanted."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:173
msgid "With Haruka, I feel like I can even go to the end of the world."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:174
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Should we break through the shining clouds and fly away?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:175
msgid "She's always wanted to go beyond the confines of the island one day. Maybe today will be the day when I can make her dreams come true."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:176
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Huh? Do you think we can?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:177
msgid ""
"Suddenly she looked worried.\n"
"She must feel anxious about leaving this place."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:178
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't worry! I'll be with you!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:179

msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"...that's right.\n"
"I'm not scared as long as you're mine.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:181
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"All right! We'll keep going straight ahead!\n"
"We'll go so far that it takes us beyond the horizon!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:182
msgid "The desk picked up speed as it headed for the horizon, but only for a few seconds."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:183

msgstr ""

#: 10281:184
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"...huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:185
msgid "It suddenly lost speed. We were steadily losing altitude."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:186
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Oh, I don't think we can! Go back! Go back!\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:187
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"We're going back!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:188
msgid "We made a quick U-turn. By the time the desk regained speed, we were about to break the ocean's surface."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:189
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, it just regained its speed.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:190
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I thought it might be that way.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:191
msgid "She seemed to have figured something out, but looked depressed regardless."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:192
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I think this is probably getting a constant energy supply from the island. It's using that as fuel to fly.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:193
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh yeah, there's no fuel on board is there. I guess you can't just conveniently fly forever.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:194
msgid "That would be real magic."
msgstr ""

#: 10281:195
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Oh well.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:196
msgid "She was somewhat calm about this."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You don't seem so depressed.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:198
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 10281:199
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I made it this far today on nothing but a whim. It's certain that I can do things now which I couldn't before. I can be sure that something is different now.\""

#: 10281:200
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"And I have you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:201

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You're right. We have plenty of time now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 10281:203

msgstr ""

#: 10281:204
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"After all, we've still got a long way to go.\""
msgstr ""
