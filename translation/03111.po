#: 03111:46
msgid ""

"\"It's only been a month. Why are we in such a hurry?\""

msgstr ""

#: 03111:58
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"But we need more data. If we don't observe......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:61
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"

msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Well... Still! That experiment was too risky! What were you planning to do with everyone there?!\""

#: 03111:65
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What experiment?\n"
"...AH!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:68
msgid "She must be talking about the experiment where we all had to keep watch over the principal's fire. There was something weird about it..."
msgstr ""

#: 03111:69
msgid "No, that experiment was full of weird things. In the end, Natsume-chan popped out of that flask."

#: 03111:74
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I was terrified when I realized it after the fact! What if Natsume-chan hadn't shown up?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:75
msgid "Why had she been scared? She made it sound like Natsume-chan had showed up to save us..."
msgstr ""

#: 03111:76
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Natsume-chan's appearance was a miscalculation on your part, wasn't it, Grandma?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:79
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Yes. I certainly never expected her to interfere with it. I wonder what brought about such a change of heart.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:80
msgid "I thought Natsume-chan simply appeared. What did she do? What happened without us noticing?"
msgstr ""

#: 03111:81
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

#: 03111:89
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Then what about all of us?! Were you just going to watch us all die?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:90
msgid "Watch us die? This is a surprisingly violent topic."
msgstr ""

#: 03111:91
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"You're over-exaggerating. That was not a large enough experiment to cause such an impact.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:92
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"It was only an average sized large flask. Altering the spatiality for one person is all it could do.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:95
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Even one person makes it a human experiment! Who would have been sacrificed if Natsume-chan hadn't stopped it?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:96
msgid "Sacrificed? What the hell are they talking about?"
msgstr ""

#: 03111:99
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Sacrifice?\n"
"Now, you're really exaggerating.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:101
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I knew there was something wrong as soon as I saw the list of equipment. You wouldn't normally leave that in the care of students without at least being guided by their teacher, Mei-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:105
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Even I wasn't much help after slipping in there...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:108
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"If you really want to help then remember this: you must never get taken in. You always need to remain a passive observer.\""

msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"You learned a good lesson.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:114
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"How can you say that? Are dead people more important to you than those who are still alive, Grandma?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:115
msgid "Haruka's statement was brutal."
msgstr ""

#: 03111:118
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:119
msgid "The principal lost her calm composure and fell silent. It looked like Haruka's words hurt her more than I'd imagined."

#: 03111:122
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"You can think whatever you want about this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:125
msgid "Haruka looked at her with pity."
msgstr ""

#: 03111:126
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Then I don't think I can follow your path any longer.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:127
msgid "Haruka protested quietly. I could hear the sadness in her voice."
msgstr ""

#: 03111:128
msgid "The principal couldn't do anything but sigh. She looked like someone who had given up on everything."
msgstr ""

#: 03111:131
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"You don't understand how I feel because you've never lost anything important.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:134
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Fine. And I don't want to know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:135
msgid "Their two opinions clashed directly with each other. And here I thought they got along great."
msgstr ""

#: 03111:136
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"...Could something like that happen again?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:139
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"So long as you fail to produce results, then I will play my hand as I wish. Otherwise, what was the point in making this school co-ed?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:142
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"......I understand.\n"
"I will get the result you want.\""

msgstr ""

#: 03111:159
msgid "It was a very long and awkward moment."
msgstr ""

#: 03111:160
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"What's wrong?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03111:161
msgid "The principal noticed that something was wrong just outside her door. Haruka stepped in front of me so that I couldn't be seen."

msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
