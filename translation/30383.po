"\"Wait here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:9
msgid "Ran ran out of the room, half-naked."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:10
msgid "In the meantime, I started putting my clothes back on. A few minutes later..."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:13
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Okay, here it is.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:14
msgid "Ran came back in fully dressed."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:15
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, you put your clothes on...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:16
msgid "Was it that special issue women have with not minding being seen naked during sex, but embarrassed when changing?"
msgstr ""

#: 30383:17
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Well, I was doing some other things too. I had to prepare our experiment.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:18
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Experiment?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:19
msgid "Talking about our experiment right after sex? Ran quickly turned to the furnace where the flask was already nice and warm."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:20
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Here we are. This is our key this time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:21
msgid "Ran was holding a test tube with a white, slimy liquid at the bottom of it. The substance in question looked rather familiar..."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:22
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, is that by any chance my...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:23
msgid "Sperm?"
msgstr ""

#: 30383:26
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Bingo!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:27
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Figures. Then you... spiked my lunch just for this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:28
msgid "Because she wanted my sperm?"
msgstr ""

#: 30383:31
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Initially I was just gonna drug you, but it turned out that I screwed up and let myself go under the influence as well.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:32
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Look, just tell me that in the first place. Don't stay quiet about it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:35
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I can't just say \"Sperm, please!\" I mean, wouldn't you get turned off by a girl who asks that kind of question?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:36
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well..... you've got a point.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:37
msgid "Sex is nice, and a girl who's a little horny is fun for all, but being asked for sperm is different. It could be taken as a desire for kids, which is frightening."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:40
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Right? So my plan was to get you too horny to hold back and then I'd be kind and suck it out.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:43
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"A blowjob's supposed to be 3,000 yen, too. I didn't think you'd forget your wallet.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:44
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see, you thought it out. ...Wait, no you didn't. You needed it for our refinement, right? If you'd just told me that upfront I'd have been fine.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:47
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Because... I'm a young girl too! It's hard to ask for a guy's sperm.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:48
msgid "Ran shouted, red in the face. That was her real reason."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:49
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So that's why.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:50
msgid "She was just embarrassed. What a cute girl she is!"
msgstr ""

#: 30383:53
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"But will this work? You went and came inside me so now my juices are mixed in too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:54
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No, Ran, you said you wanted me to-\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:57
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Ah-ah-ah! Oh, Kazushi! You went and came inside me on your own!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:58
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Whatever...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:61
msgid "Was she embarrassed about this too? She was becoming more and more embarrassed about a lot of things..."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:62
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Do you really need that kind of stuff for alchemy?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:65
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Yeah, it's a really popular source material. They often used to use stuff like blood, sperm, pee, poo, and any other kind of bodily fluid.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:66
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yuck. Really? It sounds different from the alchemy we study in class.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:67
msgid "The impression I got from class was much more casual, like instant food."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:68
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"That's because the alchemy we study here is a special branch. This island has a very special alchemic power of its own, and we use that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:71
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"It means that we can skip a ton of prep work and refine things efficiently. Nevertheless, I still can't get things to work.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:72
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"A special power of this island...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:73
msgid "No wonder it was so easy. I wasn't talented or anything, it's just that everything was already in place to do it easily."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:74
msgid "But come to think of it, this island DOES have a special power. I can feel it from time to time."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:75
msgid "What a mysterious place this island is."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:76
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So, how are you gonna use my sperm?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:77
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Just mix it in. I'll mix it with the other materials and refine it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:79
msgid "Ran poured my sperm into the heated flask."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:81
msgid "With a steaming sound, a white smoke started to drift out of the flask."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:84
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Whoa! Kazushi's sperm is in full swing!! Yeah!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:85
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Full swing, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:88
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Well, who knows?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:89
msgid "Ran stared of the flask, which was showing no signs of change."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:90
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What's gonna happen next?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:93
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"No idea. Something should be happening, though. It's because your sperm and I have perfect chemistry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:94
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Perfect chemistry? You and my sperm?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:95
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Yes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:96
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Chemistry between you and my sperm? I don't know about that...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:99
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"But...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:100
msgid "Ran pouted like a sulky kid. Then it hit me."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:101
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Does this have to do with what Fuusen said to you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:110
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"You've got to have the right chemistry, you know? I don't think anyone can beat us there, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:113
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Grr...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:114
msgid "Huh? Ran seems upset..."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:120
msgid "Clearly, Ran was annoyed by Fuusen's comment."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:121
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You're so cute...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:124
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Cute? I was really frustrated.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:125
msgid "Ran looked away and blushed slightly. The way she looked turned me on again."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:128
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Ah! No, that's it for today!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:129
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't say that, just a little...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:130
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Ah, hey!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:133
msgid "*gurglegurlge*"
msgstr ""

#: 30383:134
msgid "Then we heard a strange sound."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:137
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:142
msgid "The flask was making large bubbles. Something was about to happen. Nothing like this had ever happened with one of Ran's experiments."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:144
msgid "This is no time for fucking!"
msgstr ""

#: 30383:147
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"It's coming. It's coming! We're a perfect match - Kazushi's sperm and me!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:148
msgid "Ran seemed overjoyed with the situation. I liked her with such an innocent look on her face."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:149
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"If this works out, it's gonna be your first successful experiment, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:152
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Yes! I'm gonna turn all the world's lead into gold! Then lead'll become valuable!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:153
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ahaha, what's the point in that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:154
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Won't it finish soon? What's gonna happen?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:155
msgid "Ran was so happy even though she wasn't talking about money. I'd never seen her so thrilled."

#: 30383:158
msgid "*crack*"
msgstr ""

#: 30383:159
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hmm?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:160
msgid "I heard a cracking sound. I looked around, but the flask still seemed to be OK on the fire."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:161
msgid "Ran was still staring at the flask as if nothing happened."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:162
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Did you hear that? It sounded like something cracking.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:165
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"No. I didn't hear anything.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:166
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 30383:170
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Again!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:171
msgid "I heard it again. The sound was crystal clear, but nothing seemed to be happening to either the flask or the windows."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:174
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What's the matter, Kazushi? I don't hear anything.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:175
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I heard it clearly. What's...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:178
msgid "I looked at the furnace again and questioned my eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:179
msgid "There was a crack in space between the flask and the wall."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:180
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What is that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:183
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What's what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:184
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Look! Right above the flask it's cracking.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:187
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What? I can't see it well.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:188
msgid "Ran squinted at it and shook her head."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:189
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What do you mean you can't see it? Look, it's so clear...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:192
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Aahh!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:193
msgid "Suddenly Ran screamed out in terror. It wasn't the flask cracking up, but the wall next to us."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:194
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wahhhh!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:197
msgid "The roots coming through the walls started growing, crawling around like a snake, and growing even faster."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:201
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Over there!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:202
msgid "The plants were growing like in time-lapse from the floor and ceiling."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:203
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What's going on?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:204
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"No clue. But it looks kinda bad, doesn't it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:205
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"'Kinda'? It's hardcore bad.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:206
msgid "The crack in the space above the flask was getting big. It looked like something was going to be born from it..."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:207
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"This is definitely not good. Something crazy is gonna happen.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:208
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Wh-what do we do?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:214
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Kyaaah?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:215
msgid "This time it was Ran's turn to hear the cracking sound. I would hope she did, since the flask itself cracked, and the liquid inside started seeping out."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:216
msgid "Shit... It's gonna break!"
msgstr ""

#: 30383:217
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ran, this way!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:219
msgid "I pulled Ran into me and turned us away from the flask."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:222
msgid "We heard the glass exploding into fragments."

#: 30383:223
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ow...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:224
msgid "I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder. It must have been pierced by some of the shrapnel. In no time, my shirt was soaked with blood."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:227
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Kazushi!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:228
msgid "Ran looked up at me and noticed the injury on my shoulder."

#: 30383:231
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oh no... you're bleeding.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:232
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 30383:234
msgid "*Drip...drip...*"
msgstr ""

#: 30383:235
msgid "My blood dripped onto the floor, leaving splotches. I hadn't thought it was that bad. A puddle was forming at my feet."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:238
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"No way. This looks pretty bad, Kazushi. We've got to stop the bleeding.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:239
msgid "*Drip, drip... drip, drip...*"
msgstr ""

#: 30383:240
msgid "The puddle at my feet grew larger. Was I bleeding that badly? I thought it was just a scratch."

msgid "*Drip...*"
msgstr ""

#: 30383:242
msgid "Ah..."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:245
msgid "Suddenly I lost consciousness."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:247
msgid "The next moment, I was the puddle. Though it was bigger than a puddle, more like, yes, like a spring."

#: 30383:248
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"K-Kazushi? Huh? Where are you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:249

#: 30383:250
msgid "I wanted to tell her where I was, but I couldn't say anything."

msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Hhh?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:266
msgid "Something was floating up from the spring. It was a beautiful, glowing woman. She was a fairy of the spring."

#: 30383:268
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Wh-who are you? A foreigner?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:269
msgid "Ran asked something completely off-mark. The fairy of the spring paid no heed and spread her arms out. Two new people appeared from her frilly clothes."
msgstr ""

#: 30383:276
msgid "One was a golden me, the other a silver me. What the hell? What is this world?"

#: 30383:296
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Golden Kazushi? Silver Kazushi?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:297
msgid "Ran appraised the me on the right with the one on the left. She looked at the golden me more than the other."

#: 30383:300
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Uhh... Is this that fairy tale? Where you get whichever one you say you dropped?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30383:301
msgid "Ran stood there in a daze for a while before finally realizing her situation. Then her answer was obvious. The real me was sinking to the bottom of the spring."
