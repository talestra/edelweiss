msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"......is that you, Haruma-kun?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:17
msgid "It was getting dark, so she wasn't sure. She finally realized it was me when I walked closer, waving my hand. A lovely smile crossed her face."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:20
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Good day. Or should I already say good evening?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:21
msgid "She kept looking up at the sky. The western sky was still glowing with the orange sunset, while the eastern sky was painted with the ultramarine of night."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:22
msgid "Just between day and night. The crepuscule."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:25
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What are you doing here so late? It's almost dinner time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:26
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I was just taking a walk. What are you doing here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:29
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I was out for a walk myself. I like the view up here this time of night.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:30
msgid "Even though it couldn't exactly be called a night view, the lights were starting to appear in the houses below."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:31
msgid "The sparse, dotted lights of the town only served to make it more forlorn."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:32
msgid "Even then, it was almost like you could smell the ideal dinners cooking in each household."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:35
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"The way that light and time become vague and lose their identities at this hour makes me feel like I could blend into nature.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:38
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"And then I can start losing my own sense of existence. It's like I can turn into something I'm not.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:39
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:40
msgid "I didn't understand anything she was saying. All I knew was that she looked so alone."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:41
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Everybody would miss you if you turned into someone else. If there's something troubling you, I'm here to listen.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:44
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"That's not it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause you any concern for me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:45
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's good then...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:46
msgid "The sky changed color from orange and pink to a deep purple and an inky black. Night set in like a film being watched at high speed."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:47
msgid "It was getting too dark to even see her face clearly."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:50
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Did you know that some say the word dusk comes from a Northumbrian variant of 'ask'?'\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:51
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ask? Ask... usk... dusk. I can see it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:54
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's because this is a time when darkness begins to settle, and though you can tell someone else is there, you can't see and have to ask who it is.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:55
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Just like how you asked me just now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:58
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Yeah. I could kind of tell it was you but I wasn't sure. How could you have been so certain that it was me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:59
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It was easy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:60
msgid "Anybody could have figured out it was her by the perfect silhouette."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:61
msgid "Even on this island full of girls, no one else had her perfect style."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:62
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I can tell when it's you no matter how far away I'm looking from.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:63
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You can? That's amazing. Even I can't always recognize myself...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:64
msgid "She turned to me and formed a melancholy smile. It seemed so faint and fragile that it could be lost to the dusk at any moment."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:65
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is this what people mean when they say they're trying to find themselves?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:68
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Might be.\n"
"You're very sharp for a boy your age.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:69
msgid "She smiled as she praised me. I didn't think I'd guess right. Maybe she's just toying with me."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:72
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hey, Haruma-kun, how do I appear to you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:73
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"To me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:74
msgid "At first I thought she was asking me in a sexual manner, but the mournful look in her eyes made me realize that I was thinking too much."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:75
msgid "She continued staring at me, waiting for my answer. Her expression was covered in the veil of dusk and I couldn't make it out."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:76
msgid "The dark continued to spread over the horizon and the cape. It was hard to see her face now, and I felt I had to say something quickly."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:77
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I think you're the perfect example of what it means to be a lady. You're very beautiful and kind, intelligent, independent, and funny too...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:78
msgid "The more I thought about it, the more I realized just how perfect she was. I was very lucky to have her as my teacher, and that by itself has made it worth coming to the island."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:79
msgid "...and I just realized that it must have sounded like I was trying to make a move on her."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:82
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I see...\n"
"But does such a perfect person really exist?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:83
msgid ""
"She asked me that as if she was talking about someone else.\n"
"There's something strange about her today."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:84
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, I'm sure that everyone would say the same thing.\n"
"...by the way, why are you me asking this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:87
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Don't you ever want to know how other people feel about you? None of us is able to truly judge ourselves without external input, don't you think?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:88
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I don't know. I've never really thought about it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:89
msgid "I've never thought about how other people think and feel about me. I'm genuinely impressed that she thinks about her appearance in other peoples' minds."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:92
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Maybe there aren't so many people who worry about it. But sometimes I do.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:93
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It really worries you that much?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:94
msgid "Mei-sensei seemed so different that I questioned my own eyes. As my sight became even vaguer, so too did her silhouette."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:95
msgid "It's like she's fading into the dark."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:96
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Mei-sensei......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:97
msgid "I reached out to touch her face, afraid that it was disappearing into the darkness."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:100
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Ah!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:101
msgid "She grabbed my hand as if by reflex. Her hand was sweating a tiny bit."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:104
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You surprised me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:105
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm sorry!\n"
"I felt like you were disappearing......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:108
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Disappearing? Me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:109
msgid "Isn't this kind of romantic?"
msgstr ""

#: 02855:110
msgid ""
"She looked into my eyes to decipher what I meant.\n"
"I returned her gaze.\n"
"Isn't this a bit romantic?"
msgstr ""

#: 02855:111
msgid "And that's why I didn't notice that there was a group of people walking towards us."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:114
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Do we really have to come all the way out here just to have a discussion?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:117
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Grk!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:118
msgid "It's Mizuki. Crap, what's she doing up here?"
msgstr ""

#: 02855:119
msgid "She's not alone. There's someone else with her."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:122
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Haruma-kun, this way.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:125
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"All right......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:128
msgid "Mei-sensei pulled me into the bushes so we could hide. We were right on top of one another."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:129
msgid "My heart was pounding in my chest as I felt her body temperature."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:131
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's Hinata-san. It looks like the other girl is a first year.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:135
msgid "Mizuki and a tiny girl were looking at each other - I wonder what they're doing here? I sensed something odd in the air so I watched them in silence."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:136
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"You needed to talk to me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:137
msgid "Mizuki offered to listen, but it was with great reluctance."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:138
msgid ""
"{Girl 1}\n"
"\"...Sempai, are you in love with anybody?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:141
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Huh? Why does it matter?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:142
msgid "Well that question came out of nowhere. I don't blame Mizuki for being surprised - I want to know too."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:143
msgid ""
"{Girl 1}\n"
"\"Are you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:146
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"No. No I'm not.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:147
msgid "She said that even more reluctantly than before. Again, no surprise - I know she doesn't like talking about private issues."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:150
msgid ""
"{Girl 1}\n"
"\"Ummm...If there's no one else, then...\n"
"I love you, Mizuki-sempai! Please go out with me!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:153
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"What!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:154
msgid "What's this? One of Mizuki's female friends just confessed her love to her!"
msgstr ""

#: 02855:156
msgid "Is she a lesbian? I'm seeing a real lesbian for the first time! What a scene I've stumbled upon."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:157
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I've heard this kind of thing happens in girls' schools...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:160
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Because there haven't been boys around, the girls give each other chocolates on Valentine's Day. Hinata-san is one of the most popular.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:161
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I can imagine.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:163
msgid "Mizuki's rather tomboyish, and I can see how she'd attract a lot of girls. Not that she wants any of the attention."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:166
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Well, I'm straight.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:167
msgid ""
"{Girl 1}\n"
"\"That's fine with me!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:168
msgid "Mizuki's friend kept trying to persuade her to try things out. It was clear, though, that Mizuki was getting annoyed."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:171
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"That might be fine with you, but it's not all right with me! Why do you have to crush on me and not someone else?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:172
msgid "Mizuki muttered as if she was cursing her fate. Her friend wasn't about to give up, though."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:173
msgid ""
"{Girl 1}\n"
"\"I don't care if you hate me for now! Can I call you Onee-sama in the meantime?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:176
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Call me Onee-sama???\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:177
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 02855:180
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Gyaah?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:182
msgid "Wow! A girl is getting up close with another girl! She's burying her face in Mizuki's breasts!"
msgstr ""

#: 02855:185
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Get off of me!! Stop touching my boobs!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:186
msgid "Oh my god. This isn't fair - I want a pretty girl to go insane about me and start feeling me up!"
msgstr ""

#: 02855:189
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"I said, GET OFF!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:190
msgid ""
"{Girl 1}\n"
"\"Ahh!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:194
msgid "Mizuki threw her aside by force and took a few steps back."

msgid ""
"{Girl 1}\n"
"\"Wait! Onee-sama!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:204
msgid "She dashed after Mizuki, refusing to give up the chase."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:209
msgid "Silence settled back over us after those two were gone."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:210
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well...you don't see that every day. I didn't know that Mizuki was so popular.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:211
msgid "I'm envious of Mizuki. But still, what a waste for a pretty girl like that to fall in love with someone who doesn't want her."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:212
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You're an alumni from this school, too, right? You must've been very popular back in your day, weren't you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:215
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Me? I don't think so......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:216
msgid "She sounded hesitant and awkward. I know she was popular."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:217
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Are you sure? You must've been popular. Did that happen to you too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:220
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Maybe it did...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:221
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 02855:225
msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Let's see...\n"
"I can't remember...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:229
msgid "She only gave me vague answers. Being as beautiful as she is, Mei-sensei must have had a boyfriend from outside the school."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:230
msgid "Wait a minute, she must have graduated from college to become a teacher."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:231
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You made up for lost time and partied through college, right? It makes me want to go...\""

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You go to college to study.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:235
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Even nowadays? All I hear about college is that it's four years to party before going to work. Does that mean you were a bookworm?\""

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I believe I was...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:239
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You believe you were?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:240
msgid "She's been acting odd. I thought she was just being vague, but maybe she's not sure?"
msgstr ""

#: 02855:241
msgid "Why wasn't she sure about her own self? She was looking down at the ground."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:242
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Did I ask something wrong?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:243
msgid "Maybe she had some bad memories from college."

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"No, you didn't.\n"
"It's just......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:247
msgid "She was mumbling. She looked unsure of whether or not she wanted to continue."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:250
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"To tell you the truth......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:251

msgstr ""

#: 02855:252
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"If it's too hard for you then we don't have to talk about it. I'll just listen if it makes you feel better.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:253
msgid "Her face told me she was relieved to hear that."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:256
msgid "And she showed me her tender everyday smile."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:259
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I didn't know you were so mature. I'm impressed you can be so considerate.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:260
msgid "I see. So she thought I was just a kid before."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:261
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm mature enough to care about other peoples' feelings. Did you really think I was just a kid?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02855:262
msgid "I couldn't believe that she saw me as a child."
msgstr ""

#: 02855:265
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I'm sorry, I can't help but look at you boys as kids. You're so energetic, and always fooling around...\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I can't deny that......\""

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"No, I want you to listen to me. Maybe it was destiny that you came to me when I felt like talking.\""

msgstr ""

#: 02855:285
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"To be more specific, I don't have any memories from before I began teaching here. The oldest thing I can remember is waking up in my room on this island.\""

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
