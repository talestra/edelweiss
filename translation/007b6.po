msgid "Hinata-san, huh? I'd like to get to know her better. We do sit next to each other in class."

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Where's Hinata-san?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:10
msgid "There were a lot of people here, but I didn't see her anywhere I looked."

#: 007b6:11
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I wonder if she's...\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:12
msgid "I had a feeling that she'd be outside."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:20
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Knew it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:21
msgid "She was sitting there outside, all by herself."

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Ah!......\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:24
msgid "She recognized me and turned her head away. I ignored that and kept walking towards her."

#: 007b6:27
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What are you doing here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:28
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"......resting.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:29
msgid "Her response was curt. I suddenly had a thought: maybe she was just awkward around people."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:30
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Are you drunk?\""

#: 007b6:31
msgid ""

#: 007b6:35
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"I-it's the sunset.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:38
msgid "She turned her head away again. She might just be awkward, not a bad person."

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"

#: 007b6:40
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""

#: 007b6:44
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Remember? I called you a lesbian?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:45
msgid "Just having to explain that turned my cheeks red. What on Earth was wrong with me when I said that to her face?"
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:48
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"That really was horrible. Would you normally say that? Especially to someone's face?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:49
msgid "Shit. I didn't mean to get her angry again."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:50
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"S-sorry.\n"
"I guess I had the wrong preconception of an all-girls' school. My imagination went wild.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:53
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Your imagination? Oh come on! What the heck were you imagining?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:54
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, it's embarrassing to say, but... I imagined two girls ****ing each other, ****ing their *****, and it was pretty realistic too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:57
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Stop! Stop! I wasn't asking you go into that much detail!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:58
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? Oh, you weren't?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:59
msgid "Oops. I made her even angrier. Why do I always end up making her angry? Are we incompatible?"
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:60
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hinata-san, are you upset that we boys enrolled at this school?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:61
msgid "I wondered if that was the reason she was so grumpy. It was the only reason I could think of."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:64
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Not really...\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:65
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No? But you're always grumpy? Oh, are you on your period?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:68
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"............!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:69
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Er, no, nothing.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:70
msgid "I really think I should just shut up."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:73
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Can we not talk about that? I hate periods. It's because I can't swim.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:74
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, yeah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:75
msgid "I guess I was pretty close?"
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:78
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"I haven't been able to swim as much as I want to for a long time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:79
msgid "She stretched out like she really hadn't worked her body in a while. Maybe she's just frustrated?"
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:80
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Why can't you swim? Oh, because your period came?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:83
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"You're wrong! It's because you boys came!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:84
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? Us? Why can't you swim because of us?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:85
msgid "It had to be a false accusation, right? When I asked her, Hinata puffed out her cheeks. She looked just like an angry kid."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:86
msgid "I almost started laughing."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:89
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Until now, I could swim wherever, whenever without worrying about it. The ocean is all around us after all.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:90
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's true.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:91
msgid "This was the perfect place for swimming. To put it differently, the ocean was all we had for fun here."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:93
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"And well, there were only girls on this island, so I could readily swim without worrying about my outfit. I could just change wherever.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:96
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Now that you boys are here, I can't do that. I have to be more careful about a lot of things.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:97
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:98
msgid "She didn't have to worry earlier because it was an all girls academy, but she had to now that we were here."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:99
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I guess it is our fault then. I didn't know we were taking away your hobby. ...Sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:102
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"You don't have to be that bothered by it. I'm not blaming you all, okay? But the fact that I can't swim is so fru~stra~ting!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:103
msgid "I see. So that's why she's always in a bad mood."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:104
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So you like swimming, then.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:107
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"I love swimming!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:108
msgid "Hinata-san's smile was so fascinating it blew away all of her grumpy faces."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:109
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ah!......\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:116
msgid "We heard a clap of thunder and it started raining. It was an evening shower."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:117
msgid "Then rain picked up force in no time."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:118
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Gah! Look at the rain! Let's get back inside!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:121
msgid "But Mizuki refused to budge. She looked up at the sky and basked in the buckets of rain pouring down on her."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:122
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey? Hinata-san?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:123
msgid "We were both soaked in no time. Our shirts, our underwear, even the insides of our shoes were wet. And yet..."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:124
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Mmmmmmm!! This feels great!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:125
msgid "Hinata-san stretched out wide and screamed with joy."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:126
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Feels great? You're soaking wet!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:127
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"So what if I get wet? Rain is nothing but water.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:128
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I know, but...\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:129
msgid "Nothing but water. That's why getting wet was nothing. She had a point."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:130
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"That and it's too late now. We're not getting any wetter than we already are.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:131
msgid "She cast a glance up at the sky."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:132
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Heeeeeey! Pour hardeeer!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:134
msgid "Sure enough, the rain got harder."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:135
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Ahahahaha! It actually listened!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:136
msgid "She was so happy from the rain that she was smiling from the bottom of her heart. Maybe this is the real Hinata-san."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:137
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Haruma-kun, come over here and get wetter!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:138
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I've never had a girl ask me to get wet before.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:139
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Men shouldn't worry about little things! Come on over here!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:140
msgid "She pulled me out from under the tree and heavy rain beat against me."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:141
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wow......\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:142
msgid "Countless raindrops pelted my skin. It felt like each drop brought new life to me. It was incredible."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:143
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"How is it for you!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:144
msgid "She spoke proudly, as if it was her doing. That childlike innocence was also quite charming."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:149
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ah......\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:150
msgid "The rain quickly began to ease up, the clouds started to roll by, and in no time the rain had stopped."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:153
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Awww, that's it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:154
msgid "She looked like a child being told to put her toys away. However, she still looked more satisfied than she was before."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:155
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's a shame.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:158
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Well-\n"
"I think I had enough for one day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:159
msgid "She was drenched, but she put on a bright smile."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:160
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's right. You certainly have.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:161
msgid "I flashed a smile in response to hers."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:164
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Ah!......\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:165
msgid "She finally realised that she was smiling at me and turned away."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:166
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You don't have to hide it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:167
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"I-I'm not!\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:168
msgid "As the sound of the heavy rain disappeared, we hear a joyful ruckus coming from the cafeteria."
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:169
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So, shall we head back?\""
msgstr ""

#: 007b6:172
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Yeah, we should.\""
