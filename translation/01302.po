"\"It's so much cooler outside.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:8
msgid "Since our makeshift shacks built up a crazy amount of heat in the afternoon, they wound up being saunas by the time we'd get back from class."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:9
msgid "I started to realize it was better to stay outside until after sunset and things cooled down."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:10
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I guess I'm gradually getting used to living here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:11
msgid "I still wasn't used to the heat, but I had grown accustomed to our shacks and slept well at night. Humans are pretty adaptable creatures."

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hmm?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:14
msgid "I stopped walking when I heard the sound of water. I was drawn towards that refreshing sound."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:15
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's a swimming pool.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:16
msgid "It was a rectangular area surrounded by a fence. I hadn't been here before, but it was definitely a pool. That's where the sound of water came from."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:17
msgid "Class was already over, and amidst the still silence of this late afternoon, only these watery sounds echoed from a corner of the campus, attracting my attention."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:18
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Maybe someone's gone for a swim?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:19
msgid "That's right. If there's a pool, I can swim when it's hot. We were surrounded by the ocean, but those cliffs kept us from swimming. Summer's all about swimming, too."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:20
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I wanna take a look at it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:24
msgid "I made my way over, and peered through a gap in the fence. A cool breeze blew against my face and I closed my eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:28
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh my..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:31
msgid "I was speechless. Her beautiful wet body glistened and shone beneath the clear blue sky."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:32
msgid "Even though I often wanked to the swimsuit models in magazines, I couldn't sense anything dirty in the healthy lines of body soaked in water."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:33
msgid "I was fascinated. I couldn't take my eyes off the healthy glow of her beautiful body."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:34
msgid ""
"All of a sudden I felt deja vu.\n"
"I've encountered this body before, and not so long ago."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:37
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Ah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:38
msgid "Hinata-san noticed me. I could tell her face tightened up, even though the backlighting was obscuring it."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:39
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"This isn't how you think! I wasn't peeping!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:42
msgid "My protestations probably made her more suspicious of me. Hinata-san even covered her body and became cautious."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:43
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm sorry!\n"
"I didn't mean to......\""

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh...hey...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:46
msgid "I remember I ran into this situation before, too......"
msgstr ""

#: 01302:47
msgid "A girl acting cautious... A naked girl... Standing in the edge of the water, Hinata-san was just like a mermaid..."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:48
msgid "A mermaid......?"
msgstr ""

#: 01302:51
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh yeah!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:52

msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

"You were the one swimming in the ocean!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:62
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Ah......\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:63
msgid "I knew it was her! That was no mermaid I saw amongst the rocks, that was Mizuki!"

#: 01302:66
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"You've remembered everything?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:67
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sure I have! That was you! I knew it wasn't a mermaid!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:70
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Eh? Mermaid? What mermaid?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:71
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"When I first saw you, I thought you were a mermaid. I never realized it was you afterwards!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:72
msgid "Besides, I didn't see her face well at that time. My eyes had gone right to her boobs. ...But let's not mention that."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:73
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"You thought I was a mermaid?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:74
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, it was because you didn't come back up to the surface for a while. We kept waiting for you to stick your head above the water.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:77
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Yeah, I remember hiding underwater for as long as possible. I can hold my breath for about 5 minutes, but I set a new record that day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:78
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Five MINUTES? Wow!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:81
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"What can I say? I'm really good at swimming.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:82
msgid "She said, showing me a genuine smile. It was very attractive. I could tell she..."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:85
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Hey......\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:86
msgid "I must have been staring at her since her smile quickly disappeared."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:87
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sorry. Did I make you feel uncomfortable?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:88
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"It's not that...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:89
msgid "She had something to ask me."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:92
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"

#: 01302:93
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"How well?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:94
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Well, I didn't have my swimsuit on at the time, right...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:95
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh......\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:96
msgid "She's right. She wasn't a mermaid, and I'd taken a very good look at her naked body."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:99
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"How well could you see me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:100
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"H-how well? ...Nothing from your lower body. I didn't see anything below the waist.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:103
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Honestly?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:104
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I promise! If I had, I wouldn't have mistaken you for a mermaid, would I?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:107
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Y-yeah. You're right. ...and what about the rest?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:108
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"The rest...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:109
msgid "I searched my memories."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:114
msgid "Yeah, that was definitely Hinata-san that day. I wonder why I didn't notice it before."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:115
msgid "And her wet breasts were in plain sight. I had thought that's what naked mermaids must look like."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:116
msgid "Boobs, boobs, and those nipples too!"
msgstr ""

#: 01302:119
msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sorry! I saw your whole upper half!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:126
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"A-all of it...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:127
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Every part that caught my interest. Umm... Especially your breasts.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:130
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"AH!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:131
msgid "She was speechless. Maybe I would've been better off lying, but then the lies would never end."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:132
msgid "I should apologize again!"
msgstr ""

#: 01302:133
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm sorry!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:136
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"It was partly my fault. I totally forgot that was the day you guys were due to arrive.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:137
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Does that mean you always swim naked?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:138
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Remember, this place was a girls-only area until you guys came. That and the ocean was high that day...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:139
msgid "So I only caught sight of her that day due to several coincidences aligning?"
msgstr ""

#: 01302:140
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sorry. We must have come to the wrong place at the wrong time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:143
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"No, it's OK now. It was just a minor accident.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:144
msgid "Now I know why she's been so awkward around me."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:145
msgid "But now she looked much better. I was glad we had this talk."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:148
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"You seem like an honest guy. I trust you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:149
msgid "She showed me the attractive smile again."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:152
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Ah!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:153
msgid "She remembered something and the shock ripped the smile from her face."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:154
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Umm, and... It was just you, right? The other three didn't see me, did they?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:155
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I can promise you they didn't. They didn't trust my mermaid story.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:158
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Good.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:159
msgid "She placed her hand on her chest in relief, and breasts moved softly beneath her hands. Just imagining that softness drew my eyes to them."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:160
msgid "Her snug fitting swimsuit held them tight against her, making them look hard."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:161
msgid "But the last time I saw them, they looked as soft as marshmallows."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:162
msgid "The view from that day will never leave from my memory."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:163
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:164
msgid "Dang. I can't help watching her breasts."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:167
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Ah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:169
msgid "I think she realised I was watching her breasts. She escaped into the water."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:171
msgid "She slipped into the water like a fish, with barely a splash at all."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:172
msgid "She glided through the water, and after reaching the center of the pool, turned back and looked at me with her head only half out of the water."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:175
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"@#$$%%@\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:176
msgid "She's growling."

msgstr ""

#: 01302:183
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"!!!!\""

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 01302:191
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Come on...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:196
msgid "I could still see that view vividly in mind: her healthy body shining brightly as it bathed in the brilliant sunlight."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:197
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"There is no way I can forget that view......\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:202
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"That's not what you were saying earlier. Just forget it already.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 01302:205
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You know, even a painting by one of the great masters wouldn't have impressed me that much.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:208
msgid "She was speechless, and blushed for a second before she gave me her \"I'm upset\" face again."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:211
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"You won't calm my anger by flattering me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:212
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm serious. You just told me that I'm kind of a guy who doesn't lie, didn't you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:213
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"I could be wrong......\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:214
msgid "She sank her nose back under the water and made bubbles."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:215
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm sorry, Mizuki. I don't think I can ever wipe that view from my memory.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:216
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:217
msgid "She stopped making bubbles on the surface of the water."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:220
msgid "She went into hiding underwater. She wasn't coming up either."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:221
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Did I make her upset?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:222
msgid "Maybe she won't come up again until I leave - like last time. Maybe I should leave."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:223
msgid "But as I hesitated, I saw a shadow swimming toward me."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:227
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wah!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:228
msgid "She reached out and grabbed my belt, pulling me into the pool."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:229
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey...Wah!\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:235
msgid "I was pulled into the pool with my clothes on. I panicked for a moment, but luckily my feet touched bottom."

#: 01302:274
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Friends.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01302:275
msgid "I shook her soft and unexpectedly big hand. With the sun and its reflection off the water, Mizuki glistened, like a pretty mermaid."
msgstr ""

#: 01302:276
msgid "She looked so much more beautiful in the water than when I see her in the class room."
