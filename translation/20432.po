msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What that hell was that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:148
msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 20432:149
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"An illusion?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:150

msgid "Mizuki looked at me as I asked her again."
msgstr ""

#: 20432:205
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't drink it, put it on your meat. Here, have some meat.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 20432:212

msgstr ""

#: 20432:216
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"

#: 20432:218
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What's wrong, Mizuki? Not feeling well?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:221
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Oh, sorry, it's not like that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:222
msgid "She smiled to try and keep us from worrying, but tears welled up in her eyes."

#: 20432:223
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Mizuki?\""

#: 20432:229
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Fun?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:230
msgid "It was the total opposite of what I was expecting her to say. Mizuki looked around with a beam of satisfaction."
msgstr ""

#: 20432:233
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"I am so grateful for what you guys are doing for me. This is just like camping. And if this could go on forever, I don't think I'd mind being this way.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:236
msgid "Everyone stopped eating and looked at Mizuki."
msgstr ""

#: 20432:239
msgid ""

#: 20432:244
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 20432:248
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Me too! Me too!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:251
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"That sounds like a good business. 'Mizuki's Swimming Class'. I can charge 10,000 yen per person for half a day with Mizuki and dolphins.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:252
msgid "Ran sounded scary with how seriously she thought about that. She wasn't joking either, though it could be fun..."
msgstr ""

#: 20432:257
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"I'm having fun too. I'm not cooking for people I don't know. I'm cooking for friends whose likes I know, so I can put more effort in than usual.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:258
msgid "Fujisaki-san really did resemble a newlywed. Even in this situation, we were all having a good time."
msgstr ""

#: 20432:262
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Maybe I should put together a tour and rake in tourists? Eiden Island: Swim with a hot instructor and the dolphins. 4 days and 3 nights for 56,000 yen.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:267
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"That's enough, Ran.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:272
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"We can all take a bath together again, and I can try and wash Mizuki's back, and then Mizuki'll run away, swimming through the bath.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:275
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"That's because you started feeling up my breasts, Sakura.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:279
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"I want to go to the beach with everyone again. Summer's already over this year, but how about next year?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:280
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"We'll have to cure her body first for that. Don't worry, you'll be fine. We're all here for you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:281
msgid "Everyone looked at Mizuki with a warm gaze, and her shoulders started to tremble."
msgstr ""

#: 20432:285
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Yeah... thank you. I won't give up.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:286
msgid "Something sparkled in Mizuki's eyes. It was a drop that glimmered like a diamond and trailed down her cheek."
msgstr ""

#: 20432:287
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Ahaha... Oh, jeez...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:288

#: 20432:334
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:335
msgid "We cooked using tap water. I guess she put the drugs in our water supply before we started cooking."

msgstr ""

#: 20432:363

msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Have you found the stone?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20432:367

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
