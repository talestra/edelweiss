"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ugh, I'm exhausted.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:8
msgid "After taking my shower, I collapsed onto my futon. I felt tired yet comfortable at the same time."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:11
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"I heard you went home. How did you get back?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:12
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ah... By boat. I asked a fisherman to get me across the sea.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:15
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Really? It's that easy to get away from here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:16
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yeah, but the boat's small so it got insanely shaky once it pulled away from shore and it's a miracle that it didn't capsize.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:17
msgid "The worst part was coming back in the storm last night. I felt like throwing up just trying to remember it."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:18
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"At one point I thought I was a goner for sure. I couldn't see anything - the waves must have been ten meters tall.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:19
msgid "The waves crashed down over my head and I got thrown overboard a couple times, too..."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:22
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Oh, no! Do not want. I'd rather stay here forever than go through that hell again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:23
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I remember. You got pretty nastily seasick.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:24
msgid "We took a proper ferry to get here the first time, but it still shook pretty badly, so he could imagine how bad it must have been on a fishing boat."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:27
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Besides, now that I've got Fuusen, I don't mind staying here with her for good.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:28
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But Fuusen's not from this island, right? You'd think she may want to leave eventually.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:31
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"If so, then I'll leave as well. By that time we'll be able to warp or something, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:32
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"How many years from now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:33
msgid "At least not for the next century..."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:34
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So you're going to Fuusen's room today?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:35
msgid "Appo smiled back at me with suggestion in his lips and evil in his eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:40
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Are you asking whether I'm staying here, or if you can have some alone time in the room today? Who you bringing back?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:41
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Don't go insinuating anything. That's not the sole thing on my mind throughout the year.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:42
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Oh-ho?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:43
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I mean, girls don't like boys who only have sex on the brain, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:46
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"You think so? It's healthy for young couples to think about it all the time. In fact, that's pretty much all Fuusen and I think about, you know?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:47
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Really? Fuusen too? Are all girls like that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:50
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Gender doesn't really make a difference. When we first started out, we fucked seven times a day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:51
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Fuck! That many!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:52
msgid "35 times... No, 49 times a week!?"
msgstr ""

#: 30203:53
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Can you two really do it that...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:54
msgid "It was insane. Before I knew it, my friend had gotten so far ahead of me in the game..."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:57
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"At first I was counting, but stopped pretty quickly because I realized that quantity isn't as important for a relationship as quality. Know what I mean?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:58
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, I see. But I'm still wondering if all girls want to fuck as much as boys do.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:61
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Of course women have sexual desires, just like men. And sometimes, Fuusen even asks me for sex, you know?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:62
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sh-she does?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:63
msgid "Does Ran also think about sex as much as I do? Come to think of it, Ran was the one who brought it up. Maybe I should take the lead next time..."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:64
msgid "Maybe she's waiting for me to ask. Maybe Ran's getting frustrated because I'm too chicken to ask."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:65
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:66
msgid "But we also just did it this morning. It may be a bit much to ask her again that night."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:67
msgid "She also said she was feeling some pain down there, so she wanted some time."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:68
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hmm...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:71
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Don't dream it. Feel it. Act with your feelings.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:72
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Listen, if I act as I feel then I won't be able to control my dick. Then she'd probably hate me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:75
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"She'll accept you if she really loves you. She may be thinking the same way, you know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:76
msgid "Would she accept me if she loved me? I could take her anytime Ran wanted to do it."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:77
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You're right, that may very well be true. That's a great bit of advice.\n"
"...by the way, are you the same Appo as before?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:80
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Hahaha, I've changed because of my love with Fuusen. Call me Love Missionary Appo!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:81
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Appo... can I have faith in you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:82
msgid "I squinted as the bright sunshine created a halo around Appo. He gave me a godlike smile."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:83
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Yes, have faith. Now go forth.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:84
msgid "Appo cast a look at me like an enlighten monk. I felt very empowered and encouraged."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:85
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Alright! I'm going! Thanks!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:89
msgid "I rushed out the door."

#: 30203:97
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 30203:103
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
" *Huff Huff Huff...*"
msgstr ""

#: 30203:105
msgid "I dashed out of my room and ran all the way here."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:106
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, I'm here, but I don't know which room she's in.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:107
msgid "I'd never been to Ran's dorm room because we weren't allowed in there."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:108
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'd probably get caught if I snuck in.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:109
msgid "I saw a bunch of lights still on. If I wandered around inside the dorm, I was bound to get caught and cause a stir."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:110
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I wish that I at least knew her room number.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:111
msgid "From the outside, I began looking at the windows with lights on. One open window caught my eye."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:112
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:118
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Hmm? Kazushi?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:119
msgid "Ran was right by the window. It seemed like she'd just taken a shower or something. Her wet hair made her look so hot, and she was just gazing out at the night sky."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:120
msgid "I was getting excited by her sexy look and this coincidence."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:123
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"W-what a coincidence! What are you doing here at this hour?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:124
msgid ""
"Ran sounded a bit perplexed...\n"
"and excited."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:125
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, nothing. I was just wondering how you were doing.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:128
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"O-oh? So you came to see me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:129
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I didn't expect to find you so easily. I was just thinking about how to sneak in there.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:132
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Sneak in here? You are such a risk-taker. But I like it!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:133
msgid "Ran smiled, and I gave her a smile with a sigh of relief."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:134
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Glad I decided to come.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:135
msgid "I looked up to see a full moon in the night sky. It beamed with a dazzling moonlight."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:138
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Because it's a full moon?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:139
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"M-maybe. They say it turns men into wolves.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:142
msgid "Ran leaned out the window."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:143
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Wanna come up here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:144
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is it okay?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:147
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I'll lead you...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:148
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's not okay!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:149
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:154
msgid "A window diagonally up one from Ran's opened and out peered Mei-sensei."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:155
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oh, you caught us...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:156
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"That's not very difficult since you're blabbing full volume by the window.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:157
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That makes sense.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:160
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Well, since you caught us... Hey, Mei-chan, can Kazushi come to my room?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:163
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Of course not!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:166
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Ahaha, right. Then I'm heading out!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:167
msgid "Ran grabbed hold of the upper window frame."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:170
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Wait, it's already after curfew...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:171
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Kazushi, catch me!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:172
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What? Catch you...? Uwah!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:175
msgid "Ran jumped from the window without hesitation."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:176
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Kamoike-san!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:177
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, uwah!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:178
msgid "I rushed over to where she was falling and tried to catch her in my arms."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:181
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Hah!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:182
msgid "With her arms out, Ran fell right on top of me."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:183
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Uwah!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:186
msgid "Thud!! My rescue mission failed. Both of us fell down flat on the ground."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:187
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Kamoike-san! Haruma-kun!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:188
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oww...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:189
msgid "We both hit the ground pretty hard, but the damage was minimal because we fell on a flower bed covered with soft sand."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:192
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Ahahaha, you're all muddy now, Kazushi.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:193
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Who do you think started this? Ptt! Ptt!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:197
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hey guys! Are you two okay?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:198
msgid "Mei-sensei was anxiously looking down at us from her third floor window. It looked like she was about to jump down here as well."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:199
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"We're both safe, at least.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:203
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Just dirty all over.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:204
msgid "Ran answered without a care, her face slightly less muddy than mine. Mei-sensei heaved a sigh of either relief or astonishment."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:208
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You two hit it off pretty well, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:212
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Yes, we have. I should have started dating him much earlier.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:216
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Really... Love is fun, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:217
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Uh... I guess so.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:218
msgid "It sounded like she'd never been involved in a relationship... No way! Mei-sensei should have been pretty popular among men."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:222
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Now get up.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:224
msgid ""
"Ran pulled me up and began sweeping the dirt off my back.\n"
"Ran behaving like a girl - impressive!"
msgstr ""

#: 30203:225
msgid ""
"Well, she is a girl...\n"
"But this Ran is so different from the Ran I'm used to knowing."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:228
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Okay, let's go.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:229
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, where are we going?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:230
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"It doesn't matter where. Just...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:231
msgid "She looks back at the dorm."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:234
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Somewhere without a chaperone.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:235
msgid "Ran grinned and I thought she was provoking me, but Mei-sensei just gave us a worn smile."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:239
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Right, right, this chaperone will stay out of your way.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:240
msgid "Mei-sensei raised her hand with a smile on her face."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:243
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"In return, stay away from dark and dangerous places. Don't get too carried away just because it's summer.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:247
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I know, Mei-sensei. Let's go, Kazushi.\""

#: 30203:248
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh... Okay... G-good night, sensei.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:250
msgid "Ran pulled me by the hand. I waved at Mei-sensei and she waved back at me."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:251
msgid "I may have been wrong, but I could have sworn that Mei-sensei was watching us with envy. I don't know why..."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:256
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I never knew the moonlight was so bright.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:257
msgid "Our shadows were clearly portrayed on the ground. It was surprisingly bright. I never knew the full moon was so bright."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:260
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"You're such a city boy, Kazushi.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:261
msgid "She shrugged her shoulders for effect."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:262
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm not that much of a city boy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:263
msgid "A question popped up in my mind."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:264
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Where are you from, Ran?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:265
msgid "I knew she wasn't from the island, but didn't know where exactly she was from."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:266
msgid "In fact, I didn't know anything about her."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:269
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I was born and raised in Kanagawa. I'm from a middle-class family which lives in a little single family home built by my grandpa.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:270
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So you're a city girl yourself. I guess your grandparents lived with you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:271
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"My grandfather died before I was born, so it was just grandma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:272
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"An ordinary family. Not so poor, not so rich.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:273
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Same as mine. Any siblings?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:274
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"No, I'm an only child. My parents both work, so grandma's the one who really took care of me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:275
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You're a granny's girl, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:276
msgid "I was a bit surprised? Not really? It was kind of lackluster."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:279
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Nice breeze...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:280
msgid "The breeze must have been coming off the sea front. The wind was a bit moist, but felt cool and comfortable."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:281
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"We were all surprised at how chilly it is here at night. It gets pretty cold when we're asleep, especially with how drafty it is in our dorm.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:282
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Ahaha, I know - I slept in your room last night. It's horrible in there - you should make sure they fix it up by winter.\""

#: 30203:283
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Does it get cold during winter?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:286
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Yeah, it's freezing, although the sea stays warm year-round.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:287
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:288
msgid "I sighed deeply, worrying about whether or not a heater would even make a difference in our drafty shacks."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:291
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I wonder if our school doesn't have much money. I always thought alchemy could make people rich.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:292
msgid "Ran looked puzzled, as if a little child found out Santa Claus was in fact her daddy."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:293
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Are you studying alchemy to make money?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:296
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Of course! I heard it could turn lead and rocks into gold. Even if it's fraudulent, it's still romantic.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:297
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yeah, it is romantic.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:300
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"That, and while the academy buildings look impressive, none of the place really smells like money.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:301
msgid "Ran sniffed. She certainly had a unique talent when it came to money."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:302
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So this school isn't making much profit?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:305
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I don't think the school has any interest in it, at least. If they did, they wouldn't allow me to hold my own patents for anything new that I've discovered in alchemy class.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:306
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What? Patents? What're you making that can bring money out of those?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:309
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Here and there. Dietary supplements and such. It's having a pretty strong boom so I can make good money off of them.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:310
msgid "It sounds like she's making a lot of money despite being crap at alchemy. I thought she was in trouble financially..."
msgstr ""

#: 30203:311
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So what's the million yen for, then?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30203:314

"{Ran}\n"

"\"Testing yourself?\""

#: 30203:316
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
