msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"At least you know more about it than I do.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So we start by putting all this in, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:25
msgid "I went through the procedures just like last time. I poured the ingredients in and lit the burner. It was nothing."

msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oh, way to go. You're already better than me. You don't need me anymore.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00836:36
msgid "I can't believe she's trying to sleep in front of the principal."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:39
msgid "For some reason the principal's smiling that evil smile of hers."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:40
msgid "It's hard to work when you're being watched."

#: 00836:45
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

"{Ran}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00836:61
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So don't make me do it alone. Please help me out, Ran.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:64
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"All right. I didn't think there was anyone more dangerous than I am.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:65
msgid "She finally agreed to help me out."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:68
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00836:72
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Here, add this for me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:73
msgid "Ran grabbed a bottle of some chemical and handed it to me. The label read: \"Danger. Do not add.\""

#: 00836:74
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Doesn't this say not to add it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:75
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Who cares?\n"
"This kind of stuff should be done by following your guts!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:76
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Are you sure? It's specifically saying not to add it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:79
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What do you do when the light's just about to turn? If you hesitate, you'll get hit either way. Hesitation is your worst enemy, so go!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:80
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see. You have a point.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:81
msgid "I threw away my hesitation and dumped the bottle's contents into the flask."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:84
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"There you go, dump it in. The trick is decisiveness. If you hesitate, you won't succeed.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:85
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"All right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:86
msgid "Now that's alchemy. Your mental state can affect the outcome. Time for positive thinking."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:87
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Alright, it's all in. Next?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:90
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"The flame. Turn it up and fuse what we just poured in.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:91
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"OK.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:92
msgid "I turned up the heat. I kept my eyes on the flame as I adjusted it bit by bit."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:95
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What are you doing?\n"
"When I say turn up the heat, I mean TURN IT UP! I hate doing things halfway.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:96
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Got it!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:98
msgid "I'm a man! So I flipped the fire up to a manly maximum. I could hear the flame roaring."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:101
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oh, that looks promising. I love things with force like this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:102
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"This is so like you, Ran.\n"
"Let's burn it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:103
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Yes, we'll burn it!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:105
msgid "With the burner going at full blast, the liquid inside the flask reached a hard boil."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:106
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's boiling well.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:107
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Yep.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:108
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What's next?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:111
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"There's nothing else for us to do.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:112
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Just watch it? That's it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:113
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"That's right. Just watch it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:117
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Stop right there, you guys!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:118
msgid "When we turned around, we saw Mei-sensei standing behind us with both hands on her hips."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:123
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What are you two doing? You're not done yet!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:124
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What else is there to do?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:127
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I always tell you that adjusting the heat is the most important part of alchemy. So why are you turning it all the way up and 'just watching'?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:130
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Sorry, that's too much work.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:131
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So there was more to do.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:132
msgid "Though I'm not surprised that was her reason. However, this wasn't the way to do it."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:135
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Too much work? Ran, you know better than that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:138
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"My personality isn't suited to this kind of precision work. I'm better at loud and flashy stuff.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:141
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"And that's why you always fail. You could do it if you just tried properly.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:142
msgid "Mei-sensei was making some pretty harsh comments towards Ran. She sounded like she was scolding a stubborn child."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:143
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oh yeah? But I don't smell any money coming out of this experiment.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:144
msgid "She was like a dog following the scent of money."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:147
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"You said it can turn lead into gold, but I've never seen it once. Can you even do it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:150
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's not as easy as you're hoping.\n"
"That's one of the hardest techniques in alchemy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:151
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I don't care about any other techniques. I only want to learn that one.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:154
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"If you don't start from the basics and take them seriously, you'll never be able to do anything. Please, do it right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:155
msgid "Mei-sensei was begging Ran to study alchemy harder."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:158
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Well, if you're going that far, Mei-chan, I guess I'll do what I can.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:159
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Aren't we full of ourselves...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:160
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Please, Ran.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:162
msgid "Mei-sensei made one last plea and left."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:165
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"So now to adjust the heat. Hmm.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:166
msgid "Ran crossed her arms in thought as she watched the fire burn. This was going nowhere."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:167
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Let me take care of adjusting the heat.\n"
"You just tell me when, OK?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:170
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Alright. The right person for the right job. Oh, and if we happen to get money, it's an even split.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:171
msgid "But adjusting the heat, huh? That seemed to be the key point, and I didn't have a clue what to do."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:173
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Mei-sensei...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:176
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hold on!\n"
"That part should be......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:177
msgid "She's busy helping other groups."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:181
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Turn the fire down a little bit.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:182
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yes, ma'am.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:186
msgid "I was surprised. The principal came over and gave us some help. I quickly did as she said."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:187
msgid "The principal rarely ever talked, so I was shocked and hesitated. I'm really not comfortable around her."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:188
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Yes, that should do it. Now relax. Your mental state can affect the result.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:189
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Mental state? You mean my feelings change it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:192
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"That's one way of putting it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:193
msgid "My feelings will change the results of the experiment? I thought alchemy was like chemistry, but that's suspicious."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:198
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"(Are you two pretty close?)"
msgstr ""

#: 00836:199
msgid "Ran whispered to me."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:200
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"(Not at all.)"
msgstr ""

#: 00836:203
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"(Then why's she helping you out? I've never seen her give anyone hints before.)"
msgstr ""

#: 00836:204
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"(Oh yeah?)"
msgstr ""

#: 00836:205
msgid "But I didn't know why. Maybe she's nice to guys?"
msgstr ""

#: 00836:206
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"(Oh, that's it. Maybe she likes young boys.)"
msgstr ""

#: 00836:209
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"(Huh? At her age?)"
msgstr ""

#: 00836:210
msgid "That can't be. She's Haruka's grandma."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:214
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Look, it's begun to dissolve.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:215
msgid "The items in the flask began to melt and the color began to change. All the colors melted into a solid black."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:220
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Kazushi! Turn down the heat!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:221
msgid "Ran gave me an order instead of doing it herself."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:222
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I know, I know......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:223
msgid "Adjust the flame. Ran was getting anxious over the slight adjustments, but I ignored her in front of the principal."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:224
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"This reminds me of cooking rice over a campfire.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:227
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Hu hu, yes. That's a good comparison. You boys' ideas are quite unique.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:228
msgid "She smiled and nodded. Did I just get praised?"
msgstr ""

#: 00836:229
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Hey, it's turning white now!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:230
msgid "Ran was growing loud and excited."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:231
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Is it that amazing?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:232
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I've never gotten this far before!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:233
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You haven't?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:234
msgid "Ran always failed beforehand. We had managed to get it to turn white once already. She must be really crap at this."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:237
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"We might be just fine!\n"
"What if it turns out to be money!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:238
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Money? Seriously?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:239
msgid "I looked at the principal. She still wore a peaceful smile."

msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"We'll find out soon enough.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:243
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I've got a good feeling about this!\n"
"I think you and I may have great chemistry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:244
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Does our chemistry even matter?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:247
msgid ""
"{Principal}\n"
"\"Yes it does. The ingredients chosen, the pair who performs it, and even the instruments used have good or bad compatibility with each other.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:248
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Everything?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:249
msgid "That means that even if we all used the same materials and techniques, we could still get different outcomes. No wonder it's so difficult."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:253
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"R! R! R!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00836:254

msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00836:267
msgid "Ran was so excited that decided to do it herself instead of leaving it to me."
msgstr ""

#: 00836:268
msgid "And......"
msgstr ""

#: 00836:272
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oops...\""

#: 00836:275
msgid "*Crash*"
