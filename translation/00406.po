msgstr ""

#: 00406:23
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You shouldn't shout someone's name so loudly. It's already late at night. You'll wake the others and they'll come to check on us.\""

"\"S-sorry...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:25
msgid "Mei-sensei was acting the same as usual. Her tone was calm and gentle."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:26
msgid "I'm surprised she can talk like this to the guy who snuck in and peeped on her while changing this afternoon."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:27
msgid "Oh yeah. I haven't apologized for that. Maybe that's why I don't feel right about it."

#: 00406:40

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hahh...I wonder why ramen tastes so much better late at night.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:44
msgid "Sensei carried her ramen bowl in happiness. We looked quite the odd couple. We fixed it the cafeteria and brought it out here."

#: 00406:59
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's causing you to build up stress, isn't it? I'm here to listen if you need somebody to talk to.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:60
msgid "Why is she asking me this all of a sudden?"
msgstr ""

#: 00406:63
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You're a boy in puberty, after all. I think it's only natural for you to have things bothering you. That pent up stress is what's driving you boys to sexual crimes, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:64
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sexual crimes!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:65
msgid "Is she talking about our peeping this afternoon? I can't argue with it being a crime, but sensei, I think you're reading too deeply?"
msgstr ""

#: 00406:68
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I've never been in charge of teaching boys before, so honestly, I'm not sure what to do. I grew up in an all girls' academy.\""

#: 00406:71
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"But I'll do my best to understand you boys, so I'd like you to be more open with me.\""

#: 00406:72
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Uhh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:73
msgid "What should I say? The first thing sensei is misunderstanding is..."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:74
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Umm, you don't need to think about it too hard. What we did this afternoon, well...... I'm truly sorry!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:77
msgid "I bowed my head low in apology."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:78
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But we weren't peeping on you to let off steam or because something was bothering us. We, well... we were just interested in your naked body...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:79
msgid "Why am I confessing such embarrassing details? But, if I don't make it clear, she'll continue to misunderstand."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:82
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"My naked body? Ohh, so that's what it was.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:83
msgid "Sensei nodded in understanding."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:84
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00406:85
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"To be perfectly clear, that's it...... I'm truly sorry!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:86
msgid "I felt extremely embarrassed to have her put it so calmly. I bowed my head to her once again."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:89
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's alright. Chin up.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:90
msgid "Sensei spoke to me with a gentle voice. When I raised my head, I was greeted with her gentle smile."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:91
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You're a good kid, Haruma-kun. It seems easy, but it's actually quite hard to admit your mistakes and apologize.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:92
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm not very good at all. But sensei... Aren't you mad at us?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:95
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"That's an odd question. Of course I am.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:96
msgid "That's what she said, but she didn't look it. She continue to wear her gentle smile."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:99
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"But most of all, I wanted to know why you boys did such a thing. I was sure there had to be a reason for it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:100
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm sorry there wasn't a better reason.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:103
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"No, I'm glad there isn't something bothering you all. Now, I know you're young boys and you can't help but be interested, but don't do that again, alright?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:104
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I won't. I really do feel bad about it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:105
msgid "I bowed my head to her once again. Then I felt sensei's soft hand reach over and rub it."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:108
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"If you feel bad for what you've done, then that's enough. What's important is not to make the same mistake twice. Now, that's the end of this discussion.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:109
msgid "She took her hand off of my head. I kind of wish she hadn't."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:110
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Umm, that's it? No punishment?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:113
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"No, that's it. Look, your noodles are starting to go limp. Hurry up and eat.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:114
msgid "We were forgiven so easily. Yagami-sensei would've given us a few good blows each. I was almost let down by how easily we got off."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:117
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"They're a little soft, but they're still good, aren't they?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:118
msgid "I couldn't take my eyes off her face."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:119
msgid "Mei-sensei really was like a kind older sister. No wonder she was well liked by both the guys and the girls."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:120
msgid "She really was an ideal woman."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:121
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:122
msgid "But something was missing. I wanted to see Mei-sensei acting more angry, or shy, or something else."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:123
msgid "Maybe I'm just being picky."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:126
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What's wrong? You're not hungry?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:127
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, no, it's nothing. I'll eat them now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:128
msgid "I bet those are the kinds of expressions Mei-sensei only shows to someone special to her."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:129
msgid "To someone special..."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:130
msgid "I wonder what kind of man a mature woman like Mei-sensei likes?"
msgstr ""

#: 00406:133
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"That was delicious.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:134
msgid "She looked up at the sky with satisfaction after finishing her ramen."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:136
msgid "The night sky was filled with a blanket of stars and a waning moon."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:137
msgid "We could never see this in the city."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:138
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"The moon's beautiful tonight.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:139
msgid "To me, Mei-sensei was far more beautiful than the moon and all the stars in the sky combined."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:151
msgid "Morning classes ended and it was time for lunch."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:154
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:155
msgid "Hinata-san sits next to me, but we still haven't really had a chance to talk. I think it's because she's avoiding me."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:158
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:159
msgid "Hinata-san left her seat without a word. She does that every time class ends - immediately going somewhere else."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:160
msgid "That's why I've never had a proper conversation with her."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:161
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, Hinata-san...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:164
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Huh? What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:165
msgid "She didn't expect me to talk to her and seemed a little surprised."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:168
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"What can I do for you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:169
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Nothing. I just wanted to talk to you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:172
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"What's there to talk about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:173
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well... just to chat.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:176
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"......Did you remember something, by chance?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:177
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Remember something? What do you mean?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:180
msgid "Hinata-san stared at me for a few seconds, and then averted her eyes in relief."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:181
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What's that look for?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:184
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"Nothing, really. Sorry, but I need to be somewhere. Later.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:189
msgid "After that, she dashed off. I was fascinated by the animal-like nimbleness and supple movements of her body."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:190
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Amazing, it's like her legs are made of springs. I wonder if she's an athlete.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:193
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"What are you staring at? Are you interested in Mizuki-chan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:194
msgid "Pierre piped in with a chiding tone and a broad grin."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:195
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, Pierre.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:202
msgid "Appo and Daigo were with him. They were all smiling, which means they must have caught me staring at Mizuki."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:203
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"You two aren't getting along, are you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:204
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, I don't quite think that's it. I feel like she's being a little awkward or trying to keep her distance.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:205
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Maybe she just hates you, physically speaking. Some people are compatible, so some have to be incompatible too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:206
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Physically? It's bad, though, when you need to sit next to each other in class every day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:209
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"We should be changing our seats, soon. I'm going to sit right in front of Mei-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:212
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Right, except I'm the one in front of Mei-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:215
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"You can both sit in front of her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:216
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Seat changes...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:217
msgid "I hoped to get along with Mizuki before that happened."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:220
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Getting down over it won't help. Let's go grab lunch. There's bound to be plenty of girls in the cafeteria.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:223
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Like mature, upper class girls. When I think they drop their handkerchief, I'll pick it up and go after them.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:224
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"You want to play drop the handkerchief?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:227
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 00406:241
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Uwah!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:242
msgid "I bumped into someone as soon as I stepped out of the classroom."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:245
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Owww... I hit my nose.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:246
msgid "She must have hit her nose on my chest. She had tears in her eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 00406:247
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ah, sorry! Your nose isn't bleeding is it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:250
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Ah... Oh, Kazushi-kun. No, I don't think my nose is bleeding.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:251
msgid "She rubbed her nose, but there wasn't any blood."

msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Haruka-chan, you came to visit our class AGAIN?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:263
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Why do you like our class so much? Don't tell me there's a guy you're interested in?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:266
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"...kind of?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:271
msgid "They were joking, but her answer was a surprise. Haruka's interested in some guy in our class?"
msgstr ""

#: 00406:276
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Ah, I knew it. Girls who've lived in a boarding school without any male contact are helpless before my pheromones.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:281
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"I don't think it's you, Appo. I'd even go so far as to bet 1,000,000 yen on that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:284
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"What?! But the fact that I can't accept that bet makes me ashamed of myself.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:289
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Hmm, but I'm not sure yet. I need to find out whether or not it's true.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:294
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"I see. You need to discern whether or not it's true love for you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:295
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hmm, that's cautious. But if it was true love, wouldn't you be unable to think about it or stop yourself?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:298
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Huh? Love?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:301
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Good point, Kazushi. Love is something you feel. I don't think falling in love is something you really think about when it happens.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:304
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Uhh, umm, I didn't mean love... but you might be right about feeling things. Yeah, I feel it...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00406:305
msgid "Haruka trailed off, mumbling to herself. I wonder what kind of guy she's into? It'd be nice if I could find my destined partner by feeling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
