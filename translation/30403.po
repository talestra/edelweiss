#: 30403:11

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"We're truly sorry!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:12

msgid "Yagami-sensei was apologizing for us."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:15

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Hey! You apologize too!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:16

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, we're bowing our heads too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:17

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Of course!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:18

msgid "Because of the big commotion, we were caught by Yagami-sensei and dragged into the faculty room."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:21

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"We really are sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:22

msgid "Yagami-sensei bowed his head deeply once again. Mei-sensei looked perplexed as Yagami didn't even move with his head bowed."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:25

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Yagami-sensei, please look up. This isn't your fault.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:26

msgid "{Mei}\n\"I'm in charge of them as their teacher, and it's also part of my job to keep an eye on the alchemy labs.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:27

msgid "{Mei}\n\"You have nothing to feel responsible about in this matter, Yagami-sensei.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:30

msgid "Yagami-sensei finally looked up as Mei-sensei comforted him. His expression was still stern."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:31

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"No, Kazushi is my student. What Kazushi's done is the same as what I've done. I am taking full responsibility for this!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:34

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Yagami-sensei, please don't. My responsibility is greater than yours.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:39

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Ahaha, they're fighting for responsibility. Adults must love taking responsibility.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:40

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Don't make it sound like it's someone else's problem.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:44

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Well...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:51

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Ow?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:52

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Ngah?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:53

msgid "I saw stars shooting out of my eyes and felt a shock like a meteorite through my head. I was afraid that my head was being buried in my body."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:56

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Ouch!! What are you doing!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:61

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"You two should think about what you've done!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:62

msgid "Yagami-sensei would usually never smack a girl around, but I could tell he was pretty serious."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:63

msgid "Mei-sensei may have been against corporal punishment, but even she didn't say anything this time."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:66

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Hmph! I took heavy losses myself, so call it even!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:69

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Huhh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:70

msgid "Oh, shit! Yagami-sensei just went into Hammer Mode!"
msgstr ""

#: 30403:71

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What?!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:72

msgid "Ran victoriously glared right back at Hammer Mode Yagami-sensei."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:73

msgid "Ran was getting defiant now that she was penniless."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:77

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Kamoike-san. Please take time to think about what you've done.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:78

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I'm not going to think about it at all. Thinking about it would be dwelling on the past! I'm always looking at the future!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:79

msgid "{Mei}\n\"You can't grow as a person if you don't reflect upon your past.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:82

msgid "{Ran}\n\"But if I dwell on the past, I'll recall my money and want to die!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:83

msgid "Ran explained and started to cry on my shoulder."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:84

msgid "I kind of wanted to know how much she'd lost, but I felt too scared to actually ask her."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:85

msgid "Given that I lost a million yen myself, I'd rather disappear from existence than cry."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:88

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Sheesh, how did you manage to burn down the entire lab?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:89

msgid "{Ran}\n\"That's what I want to know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:90

msgid "I didn't know how it happened, either. I couldn't understand much about it."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:93

msgid "{Mei}\n\"So, what did you do, and in what order?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:94

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Well...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:97

msgid "I told her what we'd done, starting from the beginning. I did gloss over a few things, like when we had sex and stuff."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:100

msgid "{Mei}\n\"You two...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:105

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"You two sure have guts, having illicit sexual relations on campus.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:106

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? I thought I glossed over that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:111

msgid "{Ran}\n\"You can't lie, Kazushi. It definitely sounded like we did it in the lab.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:112

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Are you serious? Oh no...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:113

msgid "The two teachers couldn't do anything but stare at us."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:117

msgid "{Mei}\n\"A man and woman's bodily fluid, huh? That kind of method does exist, but it was too early for you guys to use it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:122

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Oh well. I guess we're just typical teenagers for these days.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:127

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Kazushi, you're paying for this later.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:128

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"R-right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:129

msgid "I should prepare to spend the rest of summer break in hospital."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:133

msgid "{Ran}\n\"But I didn't do anything wrong, right? This isn't my fault.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:138

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Nothing will happen when the practitioner is unskilled, even if the steps were right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:139

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"But what was that weird pond?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:140

msgid "It felt like we had wandered into a different world. What was that all about?"
msgstr ""

#: 30403:143

msgid "{Mei}\n\"That was a world that reflected your subconscious. Some scholars say that many of the phenomenon that occur through alchemy are a reflection of the alchemist's subconscious.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:144

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"So it was our subconscious mind? That's surreal.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:147

msgid "{Mei}\n\"It may be because you two were high at the time. If you knew how to control yourselves a bit better, the results could have been 180 degrees from where they ended up.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:150

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What, you mean a completely different result?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:153

msgid "{Mei}\n\"The projection of a mental world is a popular phenomenon caused through alchemical processes. In other words, you could call the experiment a success up to that point.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:156

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Huh? Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:157

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"So we were actually doing things right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:158

msgid "Mei-sensei nodded. Hey, we were pretty good."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:161

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What? Is that so! We were almost there!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:164

msgid "{Mei}\n\"But in your case the problem starts way before that! You guys didn't have permission to use the lab!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:167

msgid "Ran shrugged her shoulders as Mei-sensei stared at her. She pouted her lips."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:168

msgid "{Ran}\n\"But you didn't give me permission.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:169

msgid "{Mei}\n\"That's because I thought it would be dangerous for just the two of you. Lo and behold, this happened. Though it went a bit... no, quite beyond my predictions.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:172

msgid "Everybody sighed deeply. We'd blown the lab to smithereens and it was the nucleus for our school."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:173

msgid "I wondered if the reason why they were still nagging us about this is because the teachers didn't even know where to begin punishing us."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:176

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Ibuki-sensei, have you reported this to the principal?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:181

msgid "{Mei}\n\"No, not yet. The principal's off campus today.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:185

msgid "{Ran}\n\"That's why we decided to act on it today!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:188

msgid "{Mei}\n\"You're very smart when it comes to breaking the rules. Well, at least that's worked out best for everybody at the moment.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:192

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Maybe we should discuss what we can do before you report to the principal.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:195

msgid "The teachers started whispering to each other."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:198

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Umm, I have one concern...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:199

msgid "Ran spoke timidly."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:204

msgid "{Mei}\n\"You only have one concern? I have countless concerns and worries.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:205

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Well, you're not going to make me pay for the damages, are you? I don't have any money...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:208

msgid "{Mei}\n\"You don't have to worry about that, but you'd better think about what you've done.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:209

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Really, please? I'll think about it as much as you want.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:210

msgid "Ran put her hands together in front of her and begged the teachers."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:213

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Don't beg us like that. We'll do our best, but...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:217

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"It all depends on what the principal says.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:221

msgid "*RING! RING!*"
msgstr ""

#: 30403:224

msgid "The phone in the staff room rang.\n...no, it was the fax machine."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:226

msgid "*Bzzzz...bzzzzz...*"
msgstr ""

#: 30403:227

msgid "The phone stopped ringing, and the fax machine started spitting out papers."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:230

msgid "{Mei}\n\"I wonder what it is?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:233

msgid "Mei-sensei picked up the printout."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:234

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Oh, it's for you, Kamoike-san.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:239

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:240

msgid "{Mei}\n\"What are they talking about? Freezing assets?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:243

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:247

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"This one says...\nCancellation of patent contract? What's that mean?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:250

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What? What!? What is this all about!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:254

msgid "*RING! RING!*"
msgstr ""

#: 30403:257

msgid "This time it was the phone ringing. Ran answered it."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:260

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Hello!! What? Mom?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:263

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Huh? Reform fraud? They took your money? Why!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:264

msgid "It sounded like every problem that could hit Ran's finances was striking now."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:265

msgid "{Ran}\n\"No! How can it be? Now I really am penniless!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:266

msgid "All her assets were gone in an instant."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:269

msgid "{Ran}\n\"That bitch!! She really took all of my property!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:272

msgid "*RING! RING!*"
msgstr ""

#: 30403:273

msgid "The phone rang again. Ran was startled, but didn't answer the phone - she was scared of any more bad news."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:276

msgid "Yagami-sensei answered the phone for her."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:279

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Hello, Eiden Academy. ......Oh!! Sempai?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:282

msgid "Yagami-sensei snapped to attention. I'd never seen him this nervous or serious."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:283

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Yes! I'm doing fine! Oh, no, I'm sorry it has been too long. Is everything going well for you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:287

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Must be someone he knows. Yagami-sensei seems really nervous. Who could he be talking to?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:288

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I don't know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:292

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"Kazushi! Kazushi!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:293

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:294

msgid "Why was Yagami-sensei calling me to the phone?"
msgstr ""

#: 30403:295

msgid "{Yagami}\n\"It's for you. It's your father.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:296

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:302

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Owww... my ear's still ringing... That damn old man, yelling his ass off over the phone.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:303

msgid "The phone call was from my dad. Of course, it was about the bike."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:306

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Your dad knows Yagami-sensei?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:307

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Apparently they went to school together and Yagami-sensei was my dad's kohai.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:308

msgid "Actually, that's all I know about them. I've never found out why Yagami-sensei was so afraid of my dad."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:311

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What did your dad say? Was he angry?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:312

msgid "Ran seemed worried about me. I'm sure she could hear him yelling over the phone."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:313

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"He was furious. Well, I knew he would be, but there's a more serious problem.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:314

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:315

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"He told me to come home if all I'm doing is making trouble.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:316

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What? To take a break?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:317

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No. To quit school.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:320

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What!? No way!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:321

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Really.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:322

msgid "I was ready to get beaten to a pulp, but I didn't expect him to tell me to quit school."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:325

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Oh my god. You're not actually going to quit, are you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:326

msgid "She asked me timidly. But, I couldn't give her an answer."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:327

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I don't want to, but if he wants me to quit school for real, he'll come and take me home by force.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:330

msgid "{Ran}\n\"No way...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:331

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yes way.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:332

msgid "I'm willing to fight against him, but if my dad gets serious, I'm not sure how long I can hold out against him."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:333

msgid "Ran looked down like a wilted flower and stared at her shoes."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:336

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I can't take that. I lost all of my money, and now I'm losing you. What am I going to do?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:337

msgid "I'd never seen Ran so depressed. It moved me to see her like that."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:338

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Don't be sad. It's not like I won't be able to see you for the rest of my life. I'll fight him for that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:339

msgid "Ran still looked sad despite my encouragement. Then she tightened her lips with determination."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:342

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Three days... No, give me two days! I'll find us a way out of this!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:343

msgid "She sounded confident."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:344

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What are you going to do?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:345

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I don't know! But, don't worry, I have a plan!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:349

msgid "Ran started to run as she said that."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:351

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What!? What's your plan!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:352

msgid "Ran disappeared before my words could reach her."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:353

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"She's gone...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:354

msgid "What was she going to do?\n...I hope it's not something stupid."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:358

msgid "Then Ran really disappeared for two days."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:361

msgid "Two days later..."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:365

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Kazushi! Kazushi!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:369

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Fugah?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:370

msgid "I heard someone calling my name and felt a shock as I was laying down."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:374

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What do you mean, 'Fugah?!' Quit sleeping and wake up!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:375

msgid "I found Ran sitting on my stomach. She must have jumped on me."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:376

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'm up, I'm up...\nJeez, don't jump on people like that. You're not a kid anymore, you know?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:379

msgid "{Ran}\n\"No time for that. I found a way to make a fortune in one fell swoop!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:380

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"A fortune?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:381

msgid "Uh oh. This sounds bad - very bad. My spider sense is tingling at how bad this is going to be."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:382

msgid "I really don't want to hear this, but I don't think I have a choice."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:387

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You shouldn't commit any crimes. Don't go stealing anything.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:388

msgid "Of course her plan involved theft. There was a rumor that our school had a treasure buried somewhere on campus. She wanted to find the treasure and claim it for us."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:391

msgid "{Ran}\n\"It's not theft. Gold made by alchemy doesn't belong to anyone, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:392

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Isn't it the alchemist's?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:395

msgid "{Ran}\n\"If you say that then the gold in mines and the dust in rivers belong to nature. It all belongs to the Earth! Hooray for the Earth!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:396

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Calm down.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:399

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Does a 10,000 yen bill belong to the mint? No, it doesn't! So it's OK for us to take it!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:400

msgid "I beg to disagree - I absolutely think it's theft to steal a 10,000 yen bill from the mint."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:401

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You'd better calm down and think this over. They say 'You may be wearing rags, but your heart wears brocade', you know?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:404

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Your heart wears brocade? I don't understand. I don't mind the ragged cloth, but I need money!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:405

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You're pretty blunt.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:408

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Well, why are you talking like this isn't your problem? You might have to quit school if we don't do something about this!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:409

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"...you're right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:410

msgid "My dad hadn't called me since. It was weird, especially since I didn't think he'd let it go like this. Dad tends to get very stubborn..."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:413

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Well, don't worry. I called him. We still have some time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:414

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What? Who did you call?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:417

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Your dad. I told him that we'll get his bike back, but we'll need some time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:418

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What? You? Called my house? Did you talk to my dad?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:421

msgid "{Ran}\n\"He's very understanding... for your dad. I asked and he said he'll wait.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:422

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What else did you talk about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:425

msgid "{Ran}\n\"He wanted to know who I was, so I made a few things up, you know?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:426

msgid "What kind of things? I'm scared to ask her."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:427

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What did he say?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:428

msgid "I asked her timidly."
msgstr ""

#: 30403:431

msgid "{Ran}\n\"He said 'I'm going to kill him' like he really meant it, and your sister said that she needed to have a few words with you as well.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:432

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I see...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30403:433
