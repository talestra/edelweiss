#: 50305:8
msgid "It was the same door to the library as always, but today it seemed completely different as I stood before it."

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Whew, I'm nervous.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:10
msgid "My mouth felt dry, so I wiped my lips. That made me recall our kiss yesterday."

#: 50305:11
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I did kiss Mei-sensei, didn't I?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:12
msgid "I couldn't help but grin. I felt like running around the academy shouting."

#: 50305:13
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wh-what should I do today? How far should I go? Another kiss or one step further?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:14
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What comes after a kiss? Okay, to be frank what is p-p-petting?! What do I do to what on sensei?\""

msgid ""
"{Door}\n"
"\"Excuse me~\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:16
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:17
msgid "I was freaked out when the door in front of me talked all of a sudden. I thought this was just a door until yesterday."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:18
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wh-what is this? Is this door different from yesterday?\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

#: 50305:25
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Hello...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:26
msgid ""
"It wasn't the door that talked to me, it was Fujisaki-san.\n"
"Well, that makes sense."

#: 50305:27
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I didn't know you were there.\""

#: 50305:28
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"I'm sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:29
msgid "Fujisaki-san's was blushing for some reason. If she was right behind the door, then..."

#: 50305:30
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50305:31
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Hauu...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:32

#: 50305:33
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I-I see...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:34
msgid "She heard me, huh? I was talking to myself about petting. I'm such a pervert."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:35
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"I-I don't think this is the place to talk about p-pet...*mumble*... and such to yourself...\""

#: 50305:36
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Y-yeah... That was thoughtless... I'm already regretting it...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:37
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"That's for the best.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:38
msgid "Fujisaki-san blushed even more. I'm sure I was just as bad. My cheeks were on fire."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:39
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, uhh... by the way, is sensei in there?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:40
msgid "I couldn't bear the silence so I asked a random question. I'm sure she was there, but..."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:43
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"No, she's not there today it seems.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:44
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? She's not?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:45
msgid "That answer was unexpected. Usually she's here by now."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:46
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Did she oversleep?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:49
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"D-do you need sensei?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:50
msgid "Why did she stutter? Why was she blushing even more?"
msgstr ""

#: 50305:51
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, I kind of do, I kind of don't...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:52
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"I see... Have you done any pe......with sensei?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:53
msgid "She turned her blushing face down and glanced up at me with her big eyes as she asked."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:54
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, y-you heard that part too...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:55
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Oh, you really did... it... wow...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:56
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No, we haven't, we haven't! We haven't done that! Not yet...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:57
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Not yet... huh... then, were you today? Not long from now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:58
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, uhh, umm...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:59
msgid "I'm done. I can't think straight. And nothing good will come from saying anymore."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:60
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Umm, I'm going to go wait inside now...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:61
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Oh, okay...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:62
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Umm...... can you keep this a secret from everyone else?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:65
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Huh? Y-yes, of course! T-take care, then!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:69
msgid "Why did she say take care? Fujisaki-san dashed off, carrying a thick literature book in her arms."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:70
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Close call.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:71
msgid "I never expected Fujisaki-san would catch me saying such embarrassing things."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:72
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Thank goodness it was Fujisaki-san. I don't think she'll go blabbing this around, though Sakura would've.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:73
msgid "Sakura certainly had loose lips. If she found out, the whole school would know in no time."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:74
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I guess I should wait inside.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:80
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So bored.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:81
msgid "The library was too quiet for me to relax."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:82
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"There really isn't ever anyone here. That's probably why I dropped my guard.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:83
msgid "I never expected anyone other than sensei to be here this early - I'd never met anyone on the way here before."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:84
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"There's nothing but difficult books here. If they got some manga, more people would come.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:85
msgid "For one thing it's hard to even get a weekly manga magazine on this island. There's so little entertainment here."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:86
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I wonder if I'll find anything by looking around?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:87
msgid "I started to walk around, looking through the shelves to kill time."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:88
msgid "As I walked down the aisle, I came to stop at the furthest end of the library again."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:89
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:90
msgid "I saw that door in front of me again."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:92
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:93
msgid "I heard the shrill sound of the wind, or so I thought, when the door creaked open."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:94
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's open...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:95
msgid "Wind blew out from there."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:96
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But I thought it was locked before?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:97
msgid "Who opened it?"
msgstr ""

#: 50305:98
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"...............\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:99
msgid "I hesitated, but only for a split second."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:100
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm going in.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:107
msgid "It wasn't very big inside. It was just dark, cluttered, and remarkably hard to see."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:108
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It smells like dust.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:109
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:110
msgid "I didn't know Mei-sensei was there until I heard her voice."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:111
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? Mei-sensei? Where are you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:112
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I'm over here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:113
msgid "She raised her hand over a mound of books. I went around the stack, and there she was."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:118
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"I figured you'd be coming soon. But how did you know I was in here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:119
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, it was coincidence; I just happened to see that the door was open. Did you find the key to this door?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:120
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Yes, I found it quickly once I looked for it. I hardly had to search at all.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:123
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It made me wonder why I'd never noticed it before.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:124
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Was it that easy to find it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:125
msgid "It didn't seem like somebody tried to hide it, more like nobody ever noticed it."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:126
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Then this place is just used for storage?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:127
msgid "From what I could tell, it was. Dust was piled up everywhere and the books were unorganized and stacked haphazardly."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:128
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Yes. There doesn't seem to be anything worth looking at in here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:129
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, that's a let-down. If only there was treasure or something.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:132
msgid "I said it seriously and sensei chuckled."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:133
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Treasure? You really do think just a like a boy. Do you boys go exploring mountains and building secret bases too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:134
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yeah, when we were kids.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:135
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Besides, doesn't this academy just scream that it's hiding something? Like gold created through alchemy or something.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:136
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Even if there were such a treasure, they wouldn't hide in a place anyone could find like this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:137
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's true.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:140
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"But there are some very old tomes amongst the books in here, so in that sense there may be a treasure hidden in here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:141
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You mean there might be a book that can fetch a premium?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:144
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's possible!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:145
msgid "Sensei was only joking, but I was getting serious about it. The haphazard stacks of books started looking like treasure in my eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:146
msgid "I should check them soon. I could use the money for a date."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:147
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"A date, huh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:150
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:151
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Where do couples usually go to enjoy themselves on this island?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:154
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Let's see... If you go down to the town, there's a snack bar, which is very popular since they have a karaoke machine.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:155
msgid "The snack bar has a karaoke machine... It doesn't have karaoke boxes? We really are in the countryside."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:156
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Do you do karaoke, Mei-sensei?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:159
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh, are you trying to make me sing?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:160
msgid "Sensei's eyes shone with a suspicious glow. I felt a shiver run down my spine. I predict she's the type who never lets go of the mic once it's in her hands."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:161
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Would you like to go next time? It'll be my treat.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:162
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'll think about it...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:163
msgid "Considering they also served alcohol there, it set off a red flag in my mind. Then again, I wouldn't mind seeing her get drunk and go wild..."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:164
msgid "But she didn't reject the idea of going on a date, did she? I should ask her out next time. Then we'll go past kissing to petting and..."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:171
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Hey, Harucchi, does petting feel good?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:174
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTT!!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:175
msgid "It happened at dinner that night. Sakura asked me that out of nowhere and my rice with egg on top went spraying out of my mouth."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:179
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Wh-what are you doing, that's disgusting!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:180
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"S-Sakura-san, where did you...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:186
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Hey, I heard you and Mei-chan got busy today?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:187
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? Ran, you too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:188
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Hey, Kazushi-kun? What's petting?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:189
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wha-wha...?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:190
msgid "Why does everybody know? How did..."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:197
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Ah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:198
msgid "Fujisaki-san's eyes met mine and she quickly averted her gaze. Then it hit me."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:199
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Aaah!! Y-you didn't...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:200
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"I'm sorry~!!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:201
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You damn gossip!! I thought I told you to keep that a secret from everyone!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:202
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Hhhhhhhn!! I'm so sorry~!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:203
msgid "I never thought Fujisaki-san had a big mouth. I thought I could trust her."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:207
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"You can't seal a girl's mouth. Gossip is in our DNA.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:208
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It would seem you're right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:209
msgid "I won't ever trust a girl again. Other than Mei-sensei."

msgstr ""

#: 50305:243
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Why?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:244
msgid "I was carried off to the girls' dorm for some reason and interrogated. They forced me to confess everything."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:248
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Still, what kind of man are you, stopping at a kiss in such a juicy situation?\""

"{Appo}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50305:291
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50305:292
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Where? ......Oh, yeah, in the back of the library there's another room. Bet you didn't know?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:293
msgid "I tried to change the subject. I know I'll eventually have to spill it, but I couldn't just say it. I had to fight back a little to keep my pride."

"{Ran}\n"

"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"I knew about that too. I think everyone knows.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:305
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"I know about it too. Found it while looking for porn.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:308
msgid "It seemed everyone knew about it. Well, I guess it's not that surprising."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:309
msgid "Even if it is in the far back, anyone coming in and out of the library some would eventually notice it. But wait, isn't that odd?"
msgstr ""

#: 50305:310
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So then everyone knew that there was a door that didn't open?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:313
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"That door opens. The key's in the library.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:315
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Anyone can use it as long as they have permission. It's just a storage room though, so no one ever wants to.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:316
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You knew it was a storage room, too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50305:317
msgid "Well, Haruka's the principal's granddaughter, so it makes sense she'd know."
msgstr ""

#: 50305:318
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But that's odd. Mei-sensei said she didn't know about it. She just recently noticed a door there.\""

msgid ""
