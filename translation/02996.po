msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"HNNGH! HNNNGH!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:179

msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"

"\"I think it'd be a bad idea to bring Sakura right now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:240
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"A bad idea? It'd be dangerous. We should lock him up in there for a while.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:241
msgid "It was already after the time to head back, so I doubted anyone would come by, but we locked it just in case someone did."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:242
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That should do. He'll be back to normal in about an hour, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:246
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 02996:264
msgid "Rei reached for the door, but it wouldn't open. After all, the others had locked it."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:265
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Why's it locked?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:266

msgstr ""

#: 02996:269
msgid "*SNAP* *SMASH*"
msgstr ""

#: 02996:270
msgid "It didn't look like she'd used that much strength, but the lock broke easily."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:271
msgid "The destruction didn't surprise Rei. This sort of thing must have been a regular occurrence for her."

#: 02996:286
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"..................grr?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:287
msgid "Rei squealed like a little girl, and thanks to the contrast between that and her huge body, Daigo regained his sanity."

msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 02996:293
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 02996:298
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 02996:302
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"What are you doing here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:303
msgid "Rei's voice was shaking. She'd never been alone in a room with a boy before."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:304
msgid "Because she was always together with Kazuko, she didn't know what to do alone with a boy. Her heart was pounding like a drum underneath her muscular chest."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:308
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Why are you here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:312
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"I-I forgot something......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:313
msgid "Her awkward voice made Daigo realize that he was also alone in a room with a girl."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:314
msgid "This was just as new to Daigo as it was to Rei. For the first time, Daigo was seeing Rei as a woman."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:315
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Bye......!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:316
msgid "When Andou noticed the tone of Daigo's eyes change, she quickly tried to leave. But that was her mistake."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:318
msgid "Clunk!"
msgstr ""

#: 02996:319
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Ah......!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:321
msgid "Her leg caught on a desk and she lost her balance. Her body began to fall."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:325
msgid "Daigo lunged forward to save her."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:326
msgid "He could easily imagine the damage Rei would cause to the area (desks breaking, things falling from up high due to the shockwave, glass breaking, etc.)."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:330
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Andou!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:332
msgid "Daigo's hand grasped hers before she fell."

msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Ah......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:342
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Sorry!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:343
msgid "The fact that he was holding a girl's hand made him panic and let go."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:348
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Kya?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:349
msgid "Because Daigo suddenly let go of her hand, Rei had no choice but to grab his hand in order to save herself."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:354
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Oh!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:361
msgid "As a result, they both lost their balance and fell at the same time."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:362
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Ouch......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:363
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"...ah?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:364
msgid "Their faces were just a few centimeters apart. Daigo was lying on top of Rei as she lay face-up."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:371
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"What are you doing?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:372
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"What do you mean......OH!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:373
msgid "Daigo felt something odd in his hand. It was soft, yet firm. He squeezed it."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:375
msgid "*Squish Squish*"
msgstr ""

#: 02996:379
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Ah!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:380
msgid "Rei cried out when he did, and Daigo finally realized what it was. He had groped her breast."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:381
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Uwah......!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:382
msgid "Daigo was panicking, but like a high-powered magnet, his hand wouldn't come off of Rei's chest."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:386
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Hey! Your hand!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:387
msgid "Daigo thought Andou was going to pound him with her strong arms, but she was frozen there, blushing. Daigo had finally witnessed Rei's feminine side."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:391
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"(I wouldn't mind her, either...)"
msgstr ""

#: 02996:392
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"What are you thinking?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:393
msgid "And suddenly her leg felt something hard which she had never felt before pressing against her lower body."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:397
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Ah--!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:398
msgid "She could guess what it was, and once she realized it she was too scared to speak."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:402
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"A-Andou......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:403
msgid "Daigo realized how scared she was from her shaking voice. He spoke to her in a comforting tone."

msgstr ""

#: 02996:405
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:406
msgid "The pair made eye contact. In this animalistic moment, the two felt that they were the only people who existed in the entire world."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:407
msgid "Something about the atmosphere was arousing both of them."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:411
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Will you let go......AH!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:412
msgid ""

"On purpose this time."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:413
msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"N-no......AHH!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:414
msgid "Before now, Daigo thought Rei's chest was made of solid muscle, but he was wrong."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:415
msgid "Well, it was quite firm, but with nothing to compare it to, it was more than attractive enough to Daigo."
msgstr ""

#: 02996:419
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Hahh, hahh, hahh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:420

msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"
"\"Hah, ah, no...! Hey, wait, y-you're scaring me...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:422

msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It is. Maybe he smashed it open?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02996:453
msgid ""
