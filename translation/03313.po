#: 03313:19

"{Daigo}\n"

#: 03313:56
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 03313:57

msgstr ""

#: 03313:84

msgstr ""

#: 03313:111

msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What do you mean?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:121
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"She's right. Needing that much this quick is suspicious.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:122
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Why do you need to get 100,000 yen together for Ran? That sounds so suspicious.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:123
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I don't have any reason to feel guilty about it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:124
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"

#: 03313:125
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I need it for a good cause.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:126
msgid "...I didn't know why she needed it either. I didn't ask, and I didn't know what to tell these people."
msgstr ""

#: 03313:127
msgid "I really should have found out what the reason was. Am I honestly that stupid?"
msgstr ""

#: 03313:131
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"We can't understand your problem. I don't think anyone's going to help you out if you can't share your reason with us.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:134
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"100,000 yen isn't exactly spare change. I don't think any of the boys have that kind of cash on hand.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:138
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"I don't think any of the girls would either. As you guys know, it's not like this island is a shopper's paradise.\""

#: 03313:139
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You're right. Maybe I should give up......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:140
msgid "Well, I didn't expect too much from these guys anyways, but I still didn't know who else I couldn't turn to for help."
msgstr ""

#: 03313:141
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Some of the teachers might have that much. Only other option is to work and earn it, or try and pawn something off for it...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:142
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Let's see......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:143
msgid "I didn't bring any more than the bare essentials with me to the island. I don't think I can find a part time job here, either."
msgstr ""

#: 03313:147
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Hey...are you sure you're not using the money for something bad? Don't tell me you're going to use it to buy her...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:148
msgid "She said something serious before pretending like it didn't happen."
msgstr ""

#: 03313:149
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What did you say?\""

#: 03313:152
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Could you repeat that? It's bothering me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:158
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"That's enough. Can you clean out my ear wax, Fuu-chan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:161
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"You are such a big baby.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03313:166
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
