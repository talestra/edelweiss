#: 30103:18

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well...100,000 yen.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:25

#: 30103:26
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""
"{Grocery Store Worker}\n"

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Right...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:29
msgid "If only college girls would come visit this island, then it'd be a bit more active. It was so quiet, even during summer break."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, I guess I'll check down at the harbor. They say to hop on a boat if you can't repay your debts. Fishing's the best way to make money.\""

msgid ""
"{Grocery Store Worker}\n"

msgid ""
"{Grocery Store Worker}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 30103:36
msgid "Yeah, it did look juicy and delicious. I bit into before it started attracting any bugs."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wow! So sweet! You did this with alchemy too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:38
msgid ""
"{Grocery Store Worker}\n"
"\"Yup. Alchemy's some amazing stuff.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:39
msgid "If you really can turn lead into gold with alchemy, then it should be pretty easy to make 100,000 yen."

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Sorry. I was just kidding.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:67
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Please pick a better time and place!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:68
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Right, I'm really sorry. By the way, we're 500m above sea level, so if you did fall, you'd be a goner for sure.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:69
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"If you were aware of that, then be careful! Hahh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:70
msgid "I was trembling."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:73
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"But you're partly to blame for standing there like that, Haruma-kun. Anyone would want to give you a shove.\""

#: 30103:74
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Stop thinking such dangerous thoughts!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:77
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Please don't be so upset. I'm not going to do it again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:78
msgid "Mei-sensei purred like a cat. Is this a women's technique to dodge the topic?"
msgstr ""

#: 30103:79
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Fine then.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:80
msgid "Actually, her technique was working..."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:83
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What are you doing here? Worried about something?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:84
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, in fact...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:85
msgid "Mei-sensei might lend it to me if I told her, but I couldn't rely on her like that."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:86
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What's the matter?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:87
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Umm... Is it really true that alchemy can turn lead into gold?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:88
msgid "After hesitating, I asked something else. It wasn't entirely off topic, and it wasn't much different from a question I'd ask in class so she'd likely answer."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:91
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh, it's good to hear you finally asking something about alchemy. You must be getting interested in it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:92
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yeah, sort of...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:93
msgid "My motives seemed a bit impure..."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:96
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"But yes... Turning lead into gold is one of the ultimate goals of alchemy, so realistically doing so is difficult.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:97
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"And if that's your reason for studying alchemy, I'd recommend quitting while you're ahead.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:98
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That seems wrong? Alchemy was founded to profit humanity, so why can't you use it for money?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:99
msgid "Why should you give up on alchemy if money's your goal when it's supposed to create gold? That's a bit crazy."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:100
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's because the true purpose of alchemy is much greater than that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:101
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"The true purpose...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:102
msgid "I think Haruka said the same thing once. Is alchemy valuable for something other than making gold?"
msgstr ""

#: 30103:103
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Of course, there is a technique for producing gold that's been passed down. It's rumored that Eiden Academy was built using treasure earned through such techniques.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:104
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Our Academy? Through alchemy?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:105
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Just a rumor, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:106
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"They should have built a better dorm for the boys, then.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:109
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Again it's just a rumor.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:110
msgid "The boys' dorm put aside..."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:111
msgid "Our school was quite aged, but judging from the decorum, a lot of gold went into building it. To me, it held the extravagant taste of nouveau riche."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:112
msgid "That was made with money earned through alchemy? How damn much gold did they create?"
msgstr ""

#: 30103:115
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What are you thinking about? Again, it's only hearsay, so don't get too attached to the idea, okay?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:116
msgid "Guess I looked too serious. Mei-sensei advised me out of genuine concern."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:117
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I understand. It would be fascinating if it was true, though, don't you think?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:120
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It is, but remember, alchemy works based on the principle of equivalent exchange. In other words, you'll have to pay an equivalent price in order to get it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:121
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"A price... huh.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:122
msgid "I'm not quite sure what \"principle of equivalent exchange\" means, but I took it to be similar to \"there's no such thing as a free lunch\".\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:123
msgid "It's true. More often than not, easy money is too good to be true."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:124
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, alchemy's not gonna work for me here, then.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:125
msgid "All I could do was this..."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:126
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Mei-sensei, please forgive me for once.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:129
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What? What is it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:137
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Hey, hey. Have you seen Kazushi? I haven't seen him all day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:143
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Nope. We've been looking for him everywhere...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:148
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Maybe he's sleeping somewhere. One of his skills IS the ability to pass out wherever he feels like.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:153
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"But he always wakes up before mealtimes. Isn't it too late for that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:157
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Yeah...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:161
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Don't tell me he ran out on me?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:162
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Hmm? Ran out on you? What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:165
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oh, no, nothing.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:168
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"I don't get what's going on, but Kazushi wouldn't run.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:171
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:174
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Kazushi wouldn't run. So I'm pretty sure you're just worrying over nothing, Kamoike.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:175
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Really? How do you know?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:179
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"I just know. We go way back. We know a lot of about that guy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:185
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Just leave him alone, he's fine. By the way, Fuu-chan wants to talk to you, Ran-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:188
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What? Kazuko?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:193
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Ran, are you hiding something from us?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:194
msgid "Ran looked puzzled by the sudden question. For one thing, it was Fuusen Kazuko asking her. They spoke casually of late, but there were never close friends."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:197
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Hiding something from you? I know there's plenty of things I don't tell you, but we were never a pair who told each other everything either.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:200
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"You and me...maybe so. But what about... Haruka-chan or Mizuki-chan? Would you tell them something important?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:201
msgid "She had less and less of a clue what Kazuko was saying. What was she talking about? What did she want out of Ran?"
msgstr ""

#: 30103:202
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What is this? Don't beat around the bush; just get to the point.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:203
msgid "Her mind was on Kazushi right now. If he was sleeping then fine, but what if he got in an accident or something?"
msgstr ""

#: 30103:204
msgid "On the day he first arrived, he fell from the suspension bridge..."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:205
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"If you don't want to tell us, I won't force you. But in exchange, shut up and take this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:206
msgid "Kazuko handed Ran a brown envelope and her nose began to twitch. It had an all-too familiar smell inside."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:209
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What? Why? You're giving this to me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:210
msgid "She was already opening the envelope as she asked. No, she was already looking inside. It was a wad of bills like she thought."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:211
msgid "Nearly all 1,000 yen bills, and a few 10,000 yen ones too."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:214
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"102,800 yen...right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:217
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Bingo! Wow, how'd you figure out the exact amount from just a glance? What are you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:220
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"So, why are you giving this to me, Kazuko? ...Huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:221
msgid "Then she realized a bunch of girls were gathered behind Kazuko. There were about ten of them."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:224
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Hey, Ah-chan, guys, can you give us a bit?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:229
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Sure, got it. Hey! Get out of the cafeteria, men!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:233
msgid "Appo took off with the guys, leaving the girls alone."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:234
msgid "As a few of the girls surrounded Ran, she felt a bit intimidated."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:237
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What? What's with everyone?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:245
msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"
"\"That's our question. I thought we were friends.\""

msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Huh... Oh... 100,000 yen...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:267
msgid "There was just over 100,000 yen inside the envelope. Ran finally remembered asking Kazushi to lend her that much money."
msgstr ""

#: 30103:268
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What? Why did you guys bring it to me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:269
msgid "Why did they do this? Did it have anything to do with Kazushi's disappearance?"
msgstr ""

#: 30103:270
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Where's Kazushi?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:275
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"What? Has Haruma-kun disappeared?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:276
msgid "It seems Kazuko doesn't know his whereabouts either, and neither did any of the other girls. Where in the world is Haruma Kazushi?"

msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"

msgid ""
"{Mizuki}\n"

msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Enough? Enough for what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30103:299
msgid "Ran had no clue what was going on. Why were the girls suddenly raising the money she'd asked to borrow from Kazushi?"
msgstr ""

#: 30103:300
msgid "This was making for a very oppressive atmosphere."
