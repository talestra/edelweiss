msgstr ""

#: 30283:27

msgid "{Appo}\n\"You guys are lucky that it was just us. What if it was Yagami? He would have beaten the shit out of both of you. You've got to control yourself a bit, dude.\""

#: 30283:28

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Right... Sorry...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:33

msgstr ""

#: 30283:54

msgid "At first I thought this gate was just a waste of space and money, but now I understood its significance."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:55

msgid "This gate separates the two worlds of the island: inside the school and everywhere else."

#: 30283:68

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Whatcha thinking about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:69

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Nothing...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:70

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Are you sure? Aren't you fantasizing about something erotic?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:71

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"That sounds like something an old man would say.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:72

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I know that all the boys your age think like that when they're out on their first date.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:73

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Out on a first date? This is a date? I thought we were just going shopping.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:76

msgid "{Ran}\n\"If a couple goes out together then it's a date, like a rose by any other name, be it shopping, going to the cinema, or checking the stock market.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:77

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I don't think it quite works like that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:78

msgid "So this is our first date?"

#: 30283:81

msgid "{Ran}\n\"So? What're you thinking about now? Are you thinking about how far you can go on our first date?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:82

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? No. All you should do on a first date is hold each other's hands. That's what proper couples do, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:85

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Huh? What? We aren't elementary school kids, so no.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:86

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Have you forgotten how far we've already gone in our relationship?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:87

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah, you could say that...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:88

msgid "But I still thought we should reflect upon what we were supposed to be doing on a first date."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:89

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"So...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:90

msgid "I grabbed one of the hands she was swinging next to me."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:93

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Ueh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:94

msgid "Ran suddenly looked up at me after a strange cry."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:95

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What was that cry? Don't make such strange sounds.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:98

msgid "{Ran}\n\"You're the one who touched me out of nowhere.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:99

msgid "Ran flushed slightly as she argued."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:100

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What? Are you blushing?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:101

msgid "{Ran}\n\"But that kind of thing makes you blush. It's like it makes your heart flutter or...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:102

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah, true.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:103

msgid "I could feel her palm growing sweaty."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:104

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"True.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:105

msgid "I blushed too. Suddenly we were super-conscious of each other, which kept us nervous and quiet."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:106

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Why don't you stretch out your other arm? Like this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:109

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Why? Like this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:110

msgid "Both of us stretched our empty hands out to the side."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:111

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What's this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:112

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"This is how big a golden eagle becomes when it stretches out its wings. Pretty big, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:115

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Yeah. Really? Golden eagles are this big?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:116

msgid "Ran gave a short reply, and titled her head. I was so embarrassed, I tried to fill the silence with whatever I could."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:117

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"We're acting just like junior high kids on their first date ever...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:120

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Right? I'd die of embarrassment if someone we knew saw us acting so sweet. Seppuku man, seppuku.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:121

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah. But I don't think anyone we know is around right now...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:128

msgstr ""

#: 30283:132

msgid "{Rin}\n\"..................Hey!\""

msgstr ""

#: 30283:140

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Ahaha, k-kind of. You two?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:144

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Just going for a stroll. You two are on a date? Good for you!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:145

msgid "Fujisaki-san seemed really envious of us... Was she actually interested in romance and relationships?"
msgstr ""

#: 30283:149

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Believe it or not, Rin's a horny girl.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:150

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? She is?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:153

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Th-th-that's not true! Why are you saying that, Sakura!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:154

msgid "Fujisaki-san horny, huh? Hmm, I can't picture it. But that gap... is nice!"
msgstr ""

#: 30283:159

msgid "{Ran}\n\"............\""

msgstr ""

#: 30283:163

msgid "She knew."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:164

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No-no way!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:165

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Hmph. I'll remember this later.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:166

msgid "What's coming later? I'm scared..."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:172

msgid "{Rin}\n\"What are you two talking about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:173

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Are we bothering you on your date? Ahaha.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:177

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Oh, no, it's nothing. Kazushi was just raping Rin in his imagination. We're really sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:181

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Huh? Haruma-kun, you imagined?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:182

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"N-no, no! I'd never!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:183

msgid "Bloody hell, that's not funny!"
msgstr ""

#: 30283:187

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"What are you two heading out to do? You're not planning to go have sex in the early afternoon, are you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:188

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? Uh, no. We did it yesterday so I can still hold off for today...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:192

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Idiot!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:198

msgid "Ran slapped me hard on the back of my head."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:202

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Stars are coming out of his eyes...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:203

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Ow. Ran, you hit way too hard. Not on the back of the head.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:206

msgid "{Ran}\n\"It's because you acted like an idiot!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:210

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Haha. You two get along really well, huh? Honestly I was surprised to see you two going out, but it seems like things are working out really well between you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:211

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"That conversation just now made you think things are going well?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:215

msgid "{Rin}\n\"It did. You're both so radiant, I can hardly watch.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:218

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Because you imagine them having sex, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:221

msgid "{Rin}\n\"No I don't! Jeez, Sakura!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:222

msgstr ""

#: 30283:227

msgid "{Ran}\n\"........................\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:228

msgid "Whoah?! She's glaring at me again!"
msgstr ""

#: 30283:229

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No, I wasn't thinking of anything perverted.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:230

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I'm not saying anything yet.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:236

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Hey, Sakura, wait!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:237

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"Ahaha, Rin's getting out of control, so we'll be going.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:241

msgid "Sakura ran away, waving at us as she goes."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:245

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Oh, okay! Later!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:246

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah, later! You too, Fujisaki-san!\""

msgstr ""

#: 30283:262

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"OW! What are you doing? That hurts!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:265

msgid "{Ran}\n\"That's what you get for eye-raping Rin!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:266

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? What stupid crap are you saying? I wasn't eye-raping anyone.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:269

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I know that boys love girls like Rin. Yeah, I like her too. It'd be great if every family had a girl like her...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:272

msgid "{Ran}\n\"But that's not it!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:273

msgid "Hmm? You look confused. Wait a minute... Are you...?"
msgstr ""

#: 30283:274

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Are you jealous?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:275

msgid "Ran stared at me hard."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:278

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Uh... You may be right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:279

msgid "Ran admitted it and gave me a sad look. It was one of dejection... like a deflated balloon."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:280

msgid "Or like a hurt bitch."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:281

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hey, I'm just kidding. Don't worry about it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:282

msgid "{Ran}\n\"This is my first time going out with a boy, and sometimes I don't know how to control my emotions. I was acting out of line, wasn't I?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:283

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No, not that bad.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:284

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I hate women's jealousy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:285

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Well, once in a while's not so bad.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:286

msgid "Ran had always been a good sport with me, so it was refreshing to see the other side of her sometimes."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:287

msgid "If this is as bad as it gets, I don't mind her being jealous."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:290

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Really? OK, then sometimes I'll act jealous for you. That'll be 500 yen.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:291

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"That is not attractive.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:292

msgid "Ran was cute - as long as she wasn't talking about money."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:296

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, right, this store...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:297

msgstr ""

#: 30283:300

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Hello! Is my order ready?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:301

msgstr ""

#: 30283:306

msgid "{Miya}\n\"Welcome, Ran-chan. I've got everything ready. ...huh? You are...\""

msgstr ""

#: 30283:308

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Haruma. Thanks for last time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:309

msgid "{Miya}\n\"Oh, you were there too? Are you here together?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:312

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Yes... I don't like hanging out in a big group.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:315

msgid "{Miya}\n\"And yet you brought Haruma-kun with you. Mhmm...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:316

msgid "Miya-san looked at us both and smiled suggestively."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:317

msgid "{Miya}\n\"I see, I see. So you two are like that now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:320

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Well, that's how it is. So give us a bunch of extras in celebration.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:321

msgid "{Miya}\n\"I see, I see. In that case, I guess I have to give you a discount.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:322

msgid "It was just like her to use our relationship to haggle down prices, I was surprised Miya agreed so easily."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:325

msgid "{Miya}\n\"Ran-chan's a very clever girl. You caught yourself a pretty good one, didn't you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:326

msgid "A pretty good one...?"
msgstr ""

#: 30283:329

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Our meeting was destiny. I barely had to do anything, but he came like a moth to flames.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:330

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hey, hey...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:331

msgid "{Miya}\n\"The boys have only been here a short time and things are changing. Are there a lot of other girls with boyfriends now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:334

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Quite a few. They're all young and kinda cutting loose during summer break. I bet most of them will break up once classes start again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:335

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Why does that sound like you're talking about us...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:338

msgid "{Ran}\n\"No! We'll be fine. It's because we've got a very strong bond between us.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:339

msgid "Is that bond the million yen? I'd rather she quit calling it a bond and give it back ASAP."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:340

msgid "My dad may have found out about his bike by now...\nI'm petrified just thinking about it."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:343

msgid "{Miya}\n\"A strong bond, huh? Well, how lovely.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:346

msgid "{Ran}\n\"If you think it's lovely, then give us a lovely deal.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:347

msgid "{Miya}\n\"Ahaha, I can't fight you, Ran-chan...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:348

msgid "Miya-san broke out his calculator and started tapping away. Ran peered over his shoulder, and started negotiating. In the end, Miya-san folded."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:351

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Thank you, come again!\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:352

msgid "{Miya}\n\"I don't profit with you as a customer.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:353

msgid "Miya-san smiled bitterly, which meant he really wasn't making a profit. To top it off, Ran bought a ton of stuff."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:357

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Here, carry it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:358

msgid "Ran made me carry a big hempen bag. It was pretty heavy."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:359

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What is in the bag?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:360

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I'll tell you later. Now let's go eat - I'm starving.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:363

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Today I'll treat you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:367

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:370

msgid "{Miya}\n\"You are?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:371

msgid "The world went silent. Time stopped."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:377

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What've you two gone all shocked for?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:378

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Uhh... Because...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:379

msgid "{Miya}\n\"This is the first time I've ever heard you offering to buy something for someone.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:382

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Of course I offer to treat people sometimes. I'm not stingy, just very selective.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:383

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:386

msgid "{Ran}\n\"So, Miya-san, I'll take this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:387

msgid "{Miya}\n\"Huh? This is for your lunch?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:391

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You're treating me to this...?\""

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Okay...\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:397

msgstr ""

#: 30283:402

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What do you think? Good, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:403

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yes! This tastes great! But this great view is half the reason.\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:404

msgid "It was like how a school lunch tastes better when you're on a field trip. Ran grinned at me."
msgstr ""

#: 30283:407

msgid "{Ran}\n\"So what, it's good, right? Or would you rather have me make you a bentou? You want to take that risk?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:408

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Are you saying you can't cook?\""

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You bought a lot of groceries back there. Aren't you gonna cook something with them?\""

msgid "Half the stuff in her bag were groceries. Sure, there was a lot of cup noodles and instant food, but there was plenty of rice, meat, and vegetables too."

msgid "{Ran}\n\"It'd be nice if we could get by on just instant food every meal, but you'd get sick of that. We don't know how many days it'll take either.\""

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What are you talking about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 30283:417

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Making gold, of course. We don't know how many days the refinement will take, and the important part is temperature control so we have to stay by it.\""

msgid "{Ran}\n\"So starting tomorrow, we'll be living in the lab building.\""

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Living there? Will it take that long to refine?\""

#: 30283:422

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Of course. What we're trying to do is to invent the secret elixir to change lead into gold.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "{Ran}\n\"If it was easy to do, then the world would be flooded in gold by now.\""

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Can we really do it, just the two of us?\""

msgid "As the failure combo, shouldn't we lower our goal a little bit? The first important part is getting Ran to successfully conduct an experiment."

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Watch me. If I can create gold, I'll even give you a little!\""
