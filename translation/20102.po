msgstr ""

#: 20102:15

msgstr ""

#: 20102:19

msgid "{Andou}\n\"Good job, guys. Now go back to your dorm.\""

msgstr ""

#: 20102:37

msgid "The girls all split off and returned to their dorm."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:40

msgid "Yet Mizuki alone lingered, not heading back to the dorm. She kept glancing back at me."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:45

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"All right. Let's go home, guys.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:46

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:47

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Uh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:48

msgid "Obviously she wanted to say something, but something else was holding her back. There must be something she wants to tell me."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:49

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You guys go on ahead, I'll catch up.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:53

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:54

msgid "Appo and Pierre exchanged a look and chuckled with a leer."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:59

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:60

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Nothing. Take your time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:61

msgid "{Appo}\n\"I'm going to sleep, so be quiet when you come home.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:62

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Okay.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:65

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"See you later. Good night, Mizuki-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:70

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Oh, okay. Good night.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:71

msgid "Pierre and Appo left us alone."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:72

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Uh...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:73

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You want to walk for a bit?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:74

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Yes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:79

msgid "Because there aren't any tall buildings or street lights on this island, and because the sea is clear and vast, you can see innumerable stars in the sky."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:80

msgid "All we could see was the vastness of the heavens above. I felt like were walking amongst the stars themselves."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:81

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"It's amazing. I didn't know you could see so many stars here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:84

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Yeah. I was blown away when I first came here and saw them.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:85

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Tell me about it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:87

msgid "We looked like a real couple as we walked along the path, looking up at the night sky together."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:90

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Th-thanks, for earlier.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:91

msgid "Mizuki said in an excited voice while looking up at the sky."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:92

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No problem. It's not a big deal.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:95

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I guess you must find that rumor pretty annoying though. After all, this may ruin your relationship with someone special...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:96

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Someone special?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:99

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Yeah. If there's someone special in your life right now, you wouldn't want her to get the wrong idea about you, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:100

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah, but only if there is one...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:101

msgid "If there's someone I liked, I might be able to use the high-class technique of making her feel jealous through this rumor."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:102

msgid "But I also knew that such a trick usually turned around to bite one in the rear."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:103

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Is there a girl that you're serious about right now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:104

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Not really. At least not at the moment.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:105

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Hmm, I thought you were always thinking of girls.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:106

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Get out! How about you, Mizuki? What's the truth?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:109

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I'm not a lesbian!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:110

msgid "She looked mad. It was clear how much she hated it when people called her a lesbian."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:111

msgid "She didn't have to take it so personally, though. However, the truth is, I felt kinda relieved about that."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:112

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No one really thinks you like girls more than boys, including me. What I meant, was do you have someone special in your life?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:115

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"No...\nNot really. Is that bad?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:116

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Not at all. What it means is that whatever everyone else thinks about us, it's not going to hurt anybody else, at least for now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:119

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"You're right. And everyone'll forget all about this by the end of summer.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:120

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"So just let them think whatever they want to think about us.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:121

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"It won't do us any harm, so why not? And for me, it's better than being called a lesbian.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:124

msgid "Mizuki started in on me anyways."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:125

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Just to make sure, this is only a pretense, okay? Just pretend.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:126

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:127

msgid "Even so, it sounded exciting. I could feel that something thrilling would happen this summer."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:133

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Happy birthday, Daigo!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:135

msgid "Kampai!! With my toast, everybody shouted in unison. Today is July 29th - Daigo's birthday."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:138

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Th-th-th-th-thank you!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:143

msgid "{Ran}\n\"So you've now turned 48, Kudou-kun?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:147

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Yeah, right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:152

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"I didn't know that... You're still in school at that age? What a passion for learning!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:153

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Haruka, don't take her seriously.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:155

msgid "However, Daigo seemed so overwhelmed that he didn't even hear our conversation."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:158

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Oh... Thank you. Thank you...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:159

msgid "He was crying in joy."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:164

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Come on. This is just a party. Don't cry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:165

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"He's just not used to being treated kindly.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:166

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"I-I've never had a birthday party for myself.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:170

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Oh, poor Daigo.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:174

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Didn't your family ever do that for you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:175

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"My-my parents both work, so they've always been too busy...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:179

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Then Meike sure you have a lot of fun with everyone today.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:182

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Yeah... Yeaaah!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:186

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Oh yeah, when is your birthday, Mei-chan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:187

msgid "Pierre made a smooth move. Good job! There's so much I should learn from him."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:190

msgid "{Mei}\n\"You're not supposed to ask women their age.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:191

msgid "Maybe not this time... The move didn't work with Mei-sensei."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:194

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"I was only asking your birthday, not your age.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:199

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Thank you, everybody! Thank you very much! *Snort... Snort*\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:200

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Whoa! Blow your nose! Here, have a tissue!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:203

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Bbbbbfffffffffffttttttt!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:208

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Hey, hey! Don't blow your brains out! You'll tear the tissue!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:211

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"I-I-I'm so happy to be alive!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:212

msgid "Suddenly, Daigo got up and started chugging his beer."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:215

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Phaaaahh!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:216

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hey, easy. Are you okay?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:219

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"I'm okay. I'm okay.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:220

msgid "Daigo thumped his chest, but he was already staggering. He didn't look fine at all."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:223

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"It would be perfect if he got a nice girlfriend or something.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:224

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Oh, that would be asking for too much, Pierre. I'm already too happy from this - and I've used up all my luck getting this far.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:228

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Wow, you're so humble, Kudou-kun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:229

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"He's not very used to a lot of happy things happening all at once, so it's left him kinda scared.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:233

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"I'll have to be more proactive this summer. Especially since it seems like I've fallen behind Kazushi now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:234

msgid "Pierre gave me a suggestive smile."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:235

msgid "I twitched. I thought it meant he already knew about me and Mizuki."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:236

msgid "And the worst part is, he also knows that we're just pretending to see each other. He's going to enjoy watching how far we can go with this."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:241

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"You've found bliss now too, huh, Kazushi? So it's true that you're going out with Hinata?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:242

msgid "Since he wasn't there that time, Daigo must have heard the rumour. That or he's leaping to his own conclusions."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:247

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Come on, this isn't the time or the place. We're here to celebrate Kudou-kun's birthday.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:248

msgid "To help change the subject, Mizuki poured a fresh round of beer into Daigo's glass."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:253

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"This is so fun! Let's have another birthday party!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:258

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Whose birthday comes next?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:262

msgid "{Sakura}\n\"I don't think anyone has one until a fair time from now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:267

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"So Mei-chan, please tell us when your birthday is!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:272

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Umm...... mine's a ways off. Sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:275

msgid "It didn't look like there was anyone else. I guess there aren't that many people born in summer. Oh yeah, I wonder when Mizuki's birthday is?"
msgstr ""

#: 20102:276

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hey, Mizuki...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:277

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hmm?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:278

msgid "When did Mizuki disappear? I only took my eyes off her for a second."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:279

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Have you seen Mizuki anywhere?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:282

msgid "{Rin}\n\"I just saw her leaving. Maybe she went to the bathroom.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:283

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I see.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:287

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Hmm? I don't see Appo either.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:288

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah, I haven't seen him around. Wasn't he absent from the beginning?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:289

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"What a heartless guy. Where did he run off to on his best friend's birthday party?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:294

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Execution! Appo gets the death penalty!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:295

msgid "Daigo kept at it with the beer. It's just a matter of time before he passes out, so we don't really need to worry - we all need to blow off steam every once in a while."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:300

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Hey, look.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:301

msgid "Fujisaki-san tugged on my shirt with a grin."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:302

msgid "{Rin}\n\"You know, Mizuki-chan may be waiting for you outside.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:303

msgid "Oh no, not again. Why does Fujisaki-san have to keep bringing that back up?"
msgstr ""

#: 20102:304

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Why would Mizuki be? She's probably in the bathroom.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:305

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Come on, maybe she snuck outside because she wants to be alone with you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:306

msgid "I don't get it."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:307

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"If that's true, then how come she didn't ask me to go with her? What's the point in stepping out by yourself?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:310

msgid "{Rin}\n\"You really don't get it, do you? She's testing you to see whether you'd notice and come after her if she didn't tell you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:311

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? Testing me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:312

msgid "{Rin}\n\"If you truly love her, you ought to be looking at her all the time. Then you'd have known that she left.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:313

msgid "{Rin}\n\"So I bet Mizuki's waiting outside right now for you to come after her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:314

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'm still not sure.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:315

msgid "After hearing that, I started to think she might be right. Is Mizuki waiting for me outside? She's more adorable than I thought."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:318

msgid "{Rin}\n\"So go on. You can't make her worried.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:319

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yeah, alright. Thanks, Fujisaki-san.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:320

msgid "{Rin}\n\"Good luck, guys!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:328

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh? She's not here.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:329

msgid "I thought she'd be waiting just outside the cafeteria, but she wasn't there. I started wandering around looking for her."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:332

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\".........\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:333

msgid "There you are."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:334

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Mizuki.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:337

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Yes?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:338

msgid "I startled her. She jumped up in surprise."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:341

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Oh, Kazushi. It's you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:342

msgid "She looked surprised to see me. This meant she wasn't waiting for me.\n...of course she wasn't."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:343

msgid "Fujisaki-san may have said that, but we're just pretending to date. There's no way Mizuki would test me."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:344

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What are you doing here all by yourself?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:347

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Huh? Oh, I just needed to get some fresh air. To sober up, you know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:348

msgid "Made sense to me - she looked rather flushed. I sat down next to her."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:351

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"How about you? What are you doing here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:352

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Same as you. Need to sober myself up.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:353

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Hmm...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:354

msgid "How could I say \"I was looking for you because I thought you were waiting for me\"?"
msgstr ""

#: 20102:355

msgid "It would be so embarrassing to admit it. What the hell was I expecting, anyways?"
msgstr ""

#: 20102:358

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I thought you'd come looking for me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:359

msgid "Mizuki muttered something under her breath. What did I just hear?"
msgstr ""

#: 20102:360

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What? What did you just say?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:363

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Ahahaha, no way, right? Because there's no reason whatsoever for you to have come looking for me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:364

msgid "She glanced at me while attempting to laugh. Suddenly we lapsed into an awkward silence."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:365

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Actually...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:366

msgid "Fuck! What do I say now? Should I just tell her the truth? But we aren't really..."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:367

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Are you happyyyyyy?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:368

msgid "We could hear Daigo screaming from the cafeteria."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:369

msgid "It seemed like the party was now in full swing. I heard people shouting with excitement."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:370

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Daigo's feeling pretty high, huh? He must be so damn happy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:373

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I guess so.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:374

msgid "Her answer's not very enthusiastic. Is it because I didn't give her the right answer earlier? Maybe... Maybe not..."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:375

msgid "I've been thinking about Mizuki all the time since yesterday. Maybe I'm just wasting my time and energy.\n......Hey, this sounds like I really am in love?"
msgstr ""

#: 20102:376

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\".........\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:377

msgid "The awkward silence continued oppressing us."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:378

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh yeah, when's your birthday?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:381

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"What's this all of a sudden?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:382

msgid "She sounded a bit confused."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:383

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"We were all just talking about everyone's birthdays at the party. So I was wondering when yours is.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:386

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"No, that's okay...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:387

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What do you mean, that's okay? Just tell me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:390

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"No...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:391

msgid "She resisted stubbornly."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:392

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Why? It's just your birthday...\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:393

msgid "Then, at that moment--"
msgstr ""

#: 20102:394

msgid "{???}\n\"Hoooooooooohnn!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:397

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:398

msgid "There was a groaning, creepy voice coming from the forest. It sounded like it originated in the deepest pits of hell."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:399

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What the hell was that horrible voice?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:402

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I-I heard it from that bush over there.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:403

msgid "She pointed at a bush in the corner of the schoolyard. It's pretty dark out here when the lights aren't on..."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:404

msgid "{???}\n\"Uhoo! Oooooooh... Mmm!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:405

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Again...!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:406

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Is there something in there? A wild animal?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:407

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Maybe. Is there anything like that on this island?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:408

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Like what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:409

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Like...a wolf?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:412

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"A wolf? There aren't any wolves in Japan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:413

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:414

msgid "{???}\n\"Ngh... Oooooooooooh... Mmm...!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 20102:415

msgid "Wait, there's something wrong with this. That groan is starting to sound more human."
msgstr ""

#: 20102:416

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"What is it, then? Is there somebody out there?\""

msgstr ""

#: 20102:1069

msgid "{Miya}\n\"This pendant is made from a stone found exclusively on this island. It's a natural stone we don't gather very often, which is why it's a bit expensive.\""
