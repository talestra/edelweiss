"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm just as surprised at myself.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:19

#: 50105:125
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"

#: 50105:132
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"

msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"What are you guys doing?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:143
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"

msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"Oh my! To Mei-chan?! Haruma-kun did?!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:147
msgid "Fuusen's eyes suddenly sparkled. The feminine nature of her sparkling eyes alone made me sick."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:150
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"But to speak from the heart like that to Mei-chan, it's like a challenger going against insurmountable odds.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, I can't deny that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:154
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"But, I have nothing against that kind of youthful recklessness. In this case, you should go after Mei-chan. I'm totally cheering for you, Haruma-kun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:157
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"That's right. At this rate you have to do her.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:161
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50105:162
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wait. That did not sound right at all.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:165
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"No, I'm totally serious. Summer is all about fucking.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:169
msgid ""
"{Fuusen}\n"
"\"They're right. You have no choice but to fuck her. But don't worry. Once you fuck a girl, she'll be head over heels for you.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Fuusen, not you too......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:174
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"

msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"If that happens, I'll be the only virgin here...... and that's bad. Really, really bad......\""

#: 50105:180
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, I haven't gotten very far yet...... I just confessed today, so I'm going to spend the entire summer trying to get to the next base......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:183
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"We-well, in that case, I'll have to go with an escort service. Do you think they'd actually come here if I called one?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:184
msgid "He took out a flyer he had. Where'd he get that anyway?"
msgstr ""

#: 50105:185
msgid "But in general, it was rare to see him make jokes like this. Wait, his eyes look serious!"
msgstr ""

#: 50105:189
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"So you're finally going to go for it, Daigo?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:190
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Do it, do it now! Tomorrow we'll talk to a fisherman and get us a boat to use!\""

#: 50105:194
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Y-yeah!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:195
msgid "This conversation is still going. But... they can't be serious about getting a hooker, right?"
msgstr ""

#: 50105:198
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"Kazushi, you also do your best! We can do it!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:199
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"A-ah......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:200
msgid "This was getting complicated."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:205
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Today looks like a beautiful day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:206
msgid "I got up and noticed that Appo was gone. Seems he headed out while I was asleep."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:207
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Where did he go off to?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:208
msgid "I was a bit curious, but regardless, I headed towards the library."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 50105:218
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh my......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:219
msgid "Mei-sensei smiled a bit as she looked at me. Just looking at her smile filled me with happiness in the morning."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:222
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"A bit early, aren't you? I'm impressed that you got up this early, even though it's summer vacation.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:223
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, I don't exactly have a lot of time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:224
msgid "In any case, I have until the end of summer to win her over. Exactly one month. I don't want to waste time."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:227
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"You're right. Time goes by just like that. It would be a waste to let it all pass without realizing it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:228
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Exactly. So, is there anything I can help you with today?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:229
msgid "I looked around the library. It was cleaned not too long ago, and given that there weren't any students in there reading this morning, it was rather quiet."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:232
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"There isn't anything I can think of right now. Did you wake up early just to give me a hand?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:233
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"There isn't much I can do besides this. I want to convince you as much as possible.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:236
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh my......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:237
msgid "She looked flabbergasted."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:238
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"What you said yesterday... you were serious, weren't you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:239
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Eh? Of course. Did you think I was joking?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:242
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Well not exactly...... I wondered if a young person like yourself would simply forget it the next day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:243
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No way!! Even if I don't have a good memory, this is not something I would forget.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:246
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:247
msgid "She paused in amazement. I guess she wasn't one to understand what it was like for someone to show an interest in her."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:248
msgid "This summer was not going to be enough time to show her my feelings towards her. The road ahead is a long one."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:249
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sensei, did you have any plans for today?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:252
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"There are some things I need to look up. It's a personal matter, so I wouldn't need your assistance with it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:253
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, but I'd be delighted to help.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:256
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Really? Kazushi-kun, if you insist then I wouldn't mind.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:257
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Of course...... wait what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:258
msgid "Just then, I thought I heard her say something different. Did she just......"
msgstr ""

#: 50105:259
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ah, Kazushi-kun she said?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:260
msgid "She just called me Kazushi-kun. Not Haruma-kun like she normally does."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:263
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Just for the summer vacation. If I call you the way I normally do, then I won't be able to remove myself from being a teacher.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:264
msgid "It is refreshing to hear just my first name. Mei-sensei always referred to the boys with a \"-kun\", so this alone made it feel special."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:265
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, maybe I could call you Mei as well?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:268
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Hey, don't get carried away now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:269
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ah, I guess not.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:270
msgid "However, this was more than enough. To think I could be that happy with just the way she said my name."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:273
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Well, I'm off then.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:275
msgid "With that, Mei-sensei stood up from her chair."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:276
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Where are you going?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:277
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Like I said, I'm going to go look something up.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:279
msgid "She walked over to the bookshelves. I hurriedly followed after her."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:280
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I said I'll help you out. What are you trying to find?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:283
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"It's in regards to the island's legends and folktales. I've got a bit of an interest in it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:284
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:285
msgid "Or that's all I could say. It was something I certainly had no interest in. But, if that's what sensei is interested in, then I will become interested as well."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:286
msgid "Sensei walked past the tall bookshelves and suddenly came to a stop at one of the racks."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:287
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"This rack contains all the books that concern the island's folktales and legends.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:288
msgid "There were a lot of old books. There seemed to be a lot of handmade volumes as well, judging from the hand-sewn covers on some of them."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:289
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"There are quite a lot of books, aren't there?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:292
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"There are quite a lot of books that were self-published or were never publicly sold. Look at the penmanship on this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:294
msgid "She took one book down and opened it up for me. The book looked more like someone's notebook with their writings in it."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:298
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"This island may not be well-known by society, but it seems there were quite a number of scholars with an interest in this place. Of course, this was long before this school was built.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:300
msgid "That's the reason for all these old books. This school is rather old in itself, but apparently there was quite a lot written about this place beforehand."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:301
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Are there any interesting stories about the island?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:302
msgid "I didn't really have a lot of interest in it, but I asked anyway. My mind was more or less focused on drawing her affection, even if only by a little bit."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:305
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"There's a legend that the flowers on this island were in fact stars that fell from the sky.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:306
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Stars that turned into flowers? Ah, could that be......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:307
msgid "Something flashed in my mind. Through the power of love, the image of a star-shaped flower came to mind."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:308
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's that flower right? The one used in alchemy?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:309
msgid "The flowers used in alchemy. The flowers that the principal carefully tended to."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:312
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh my, you are correct. Yes, those flowers. There's folktales that mentions that those flowers were born from the stars.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:313
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wow, it's rather romantic, isn't it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:314
msgid "Just the two of us alone talking about romantic matters made for a rather intoxicating state of affairs. This summer will definitely be different from the others."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:317
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Kazushi-kun, are you also interested in this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:318
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Of course, of course! This Haruma is a romantic. Some may say a man who is a non-stop romantic!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:321
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh my. So then you're, Haroman-kun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:322
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Haroman-kun......Haruman-kun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:323
msgid "It had an odd ring to it as she said it twice."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:324
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Am......amusing!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:325
msgid "Love is a matter of faith. If Mei-sensei enjoys them, then I will also enjoy puns. Long live puns!"
msgstr ""

#: 50105:328
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Well, if you are that interested, then why don't we find some more together?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:329
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Absolutely! Yes, let's do that!\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:330
msgid "As long as I am with her, I'll take remedial lessons or even clean the restrooms just to make that happen."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:333
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Okay Kazushi-kun, why don't you take this notepad and jot down 100 puns for me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:334
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? Puns?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:335
msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Training like this will give you an edge when looking for a job, but be careful with your material - I really hate bad puns.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Eh? Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:337
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 50105:338
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Uhm, well, this wasn't what I had an interest in...... If possible, let's talk more about the legend of this island.\""

msgid ""
"{Mei}\n"
"\"Oh my, is that so? I see......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50105:342
msgid "I didn't think she would look that disappointed."
msgstr ""

#: 50105:347
msgid "Of course, I also forgot how I'm exceptionally weak against the printed word."
