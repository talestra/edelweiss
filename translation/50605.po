"{Principal}\n"
"\"Greetings, everyone. I am Aozora Hisae, the principal of this academy. For the next three years, we will all be living together here at this academy...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:15
msgid "I've become a teacher at Eiden Academy."

msgid ""
"{Yagami}\n"
"\"Who'd have thought Kazushi would become a teacher. Oh, I guess I should be calling you Haruma-sensei now, huh?\""

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Ahaha, at least in front of the students, please.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:21
msgid "I'll be in charge of teaching Alchemy."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:22
msgid "The reason why I chose to teach Alchemy isn't because I wanted to revive Mei or anything like that. I just wanted to follow in her footsteps."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:23
msgid "And that meant this was the only academy I could be employed at, so naturally I came back here."

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's been a long time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:27
msgid "The room hadn't changed a bit. It still had the sour smell of old books... Even the books on the shelves were hardly any different from what I remembered."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:28
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No one's here, huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:29
msgid "This place was still as unpopular as ever."

#: 50605:30
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Jeez, read some books, guys.........\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:31
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh......\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:33
msgid "There is someone - a girl - reading books in a chair by the windowsill."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:34
msgid "I wonder what year she's in? She has a beautiful and rather mature looking profile."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:36
msgid ""
"{The girl}\n"
"\"Oh......?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:37
msgid "She looked up from her book after sensing my eyes on her."

msgid ""
"{The girl}\n"
"\"Hello.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:39

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"H-hello.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:41
msgid "I stuttered. Why am I nervous?"

#: 50605:42
msgid ""
"{The girl}\n"
"\"Umm... you're the new alchemy teacher, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:43
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, yes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:44
msgid "She probably remembered my face from the beginning of the opening ceremony."

#: 50605:45
msgid ""
"{The girl}\n"
"\"Umm, it's such a coincidence, isn't it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:46
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What? What is?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:47
msgid ""
"{The girl}\n"
"\"Sensei, your name is Haruma, right? My name is Haruma too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:48
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:49
msgid "That really is a coincidence. Haruma's not that common of a name, is it? I've never met another Haruma in the same grade as me."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:51
msgid ""
"{Haruma}\n"
"\"When I heard your name at the ceremony, I was surprised.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:52
msgid "Despite her mature looking face, she had a childish smile. The girl had a strange mix of mature and youthful attractiveness."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:53
msgid ""
"{Haruma}\n"
"\"Do you like books too, sensei?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:54
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yeah, I suppose so. I used to be a librarian here back in the day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:55
msgid ""
"{Haruma}\n"
"\"Oh, you graduated from here? I'm a librarian too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:56
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You too? This really is a coincidence.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:57
msgid "Coincidences do happen together. I suddenly felt a sense of closeness to her."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:58
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Then, Haruma... er, it's hard to call you that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:59
msgid "It does feel weird calling someone by my own last name."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:60
msgid ""
"{Haruma}\n"
"\"Then, you can call me by my first name.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:61
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What is your first name?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:64
msgid ""
"{Saki}\n"
"\"Saki. Haruma Saki, sophomore. Nice to meet you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:65
msgid "She bowed politely. I found myself just standing there."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:66
msgid "Haruma Saki - that was the name I gave Mei when she asked me for one."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:67
msgid "Her name came from the thought I had - that the next stage for a flower after it sprouts (Mei), is to bloom (Saku)."

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\".....................\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:69
msgid "This is a coincidence, isn't it?"
msgstr ""

#: 50605:70
msgid "Reincarnation?"
msgstr ""

#: 50605:71
msgid "No, she couldn't have chosen her own name. It can't be."

msgid ""
"{Saki}\n"
"\"Um, sensei? What's wrong?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:74
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh... nothing...\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:75
msgid "I just realized that I was staring at her. I looked away in a hurry."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:76
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm sorry. I was thinking you look just like someone I know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:77
msgid "What is it, really? She doesn't particularly look like her, I guess. It must be a coincidence."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:78
msgid "Yes, just a coincidence. But even so, that coincidence made me rather happy."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:79
msgid ""
"{Saki}\n"
"\"Is the person I look like perhaps your old lover?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:80
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh? Yeah, something like that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:81
msgid ""
"{Saki}\n"
"\"What? It really is? Wow, amazing.\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:82
msgid "I guess girls at this age like that kind of subject. Her eyes were shining already."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:83
msgid ""
"{Saki}\n"
"\"Sensei, you loved that person, didn't you? Umm... what's like to be in love?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:84
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh...?\""
msgstr ""

#: 50605:85
msgid "What a nostalgic question. Is this question another coincidence too? It was the question we both tried to find the answer to together."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:86
msgid "But now I can proudly answer it."
msgstr ""

#: 50605:87
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Let's see. Being in love is like............\""
