msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What do you guys wanna do today?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:8

msgid "We were trying to figure out what to do as we ate breakfast. This was the best part of summer break: having the entire day wide open to do whatever we want."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:11

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Let's go out and have fun with the girls again. I'll definitely make a move this time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:16

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"I want to go collect some bugs. I need to send my relative some stag beetles.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:23

msgid "{Appo}\n\"I'm going fishing with Fuu-chan today. She's never been before.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:24

msgid "{Appo}\n\"She said she can't touch the bugs used for bait, so I have to put them on for her. Girls are so cute.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:25

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Fishing sounds fun.\nShould we go, too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:26

msgid "When I thought about it, it would've been a waste not to go fishing, given that we were on an island. I still remembered the mountain of tuna we saw on our arrival."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:27

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Isn't this island an ideal place to fish, too?\nRemember those huge tuna? Let's go catch something fresh for dinner.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:28

msgid "It was our turn to cook, so we're in charge of tonight's dinner.\nI wanted to surprise everybody."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:29

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"If we cooked up fish we caught ourselves, wouldn't that reel in the points?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:30

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Exactly! Let's fish up a big one and slice and dice it in front of everyone!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:33

msgid "{Appo}\n\"A dissection show, huh? I heard on TV that some sushi restaurants actually do that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:36

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Sushi...yeah. It's not very hard to make sushi rolls.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:37

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"And if we set it up so everyone rolls their own, it's easier for us. Alright! Tonight it's make-it-yourself sushi! Let's go hook those fish!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:40

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Why don't we ask some of the girls to come with us! If Fuu-chan's never been fishing, I bet there's others who haven't as well.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:43

msgid "{Appo}\n\"Fuusen was telling me how girls find men who are in tune with nature and boast survival skills very attractive.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:44

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"The outdoor boom isn't over yet! And if we teach those girls who know nothing, we'll score even more points!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:45

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Guys, forget what I said earlier about hunting for beetles.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:46

msgid "{Appo}\n\"We can rent whatever we need from the fishermen by the beach.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:47

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Let me take care of renting the gear.\nPierre, why don't you go ask the girls?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:48

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Okay! I'll round 'em up!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:49

msgid "Our minds were already filled with thoughts of clear blue ocean waves and pretty girls."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:54

msgid "When I got back from the gear rental, the girls were already waiting."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:57

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"We don't have any supplies, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:58

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Here you go. I just got back from the rental shop.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:64

msgid "{Andou}\n\"Wow, you guys are well prepared.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:65

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Good job, boys.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:66

msgid "Fuusen and Andou seemed to be looking forward to this.\nAlso..."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:71

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Hey, hey, how much do you think the fish will go for? Where can we get the expensive ones?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:72

msgid "There was one girl with a yen for a yen."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:73

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Can't you be a bit more romantic about this? We're not fishermen; we're going to eat everything we catch today.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:76

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What are you talking about? How are we going to make any money if we do that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:77

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"We're not going fishing today just to make money. If you trawl the line with thoughts like that, you won't get any.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:80

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Cut the chat, just guide me to where we can fish for expensive ones.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:81

msgid "She fully intends on fishing up a big one and selling it off for big profit. Well, as long as she has fun..."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:82

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I talked to the local fishermen and got the right bait. I even had them tell me some good spots. The only the thing we'll need is patience.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:85

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Patience?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:86

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Even if you're not catching any, you can't carry on or the fish will run away more. You'll have to quietly leave the line out.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:87

msgid "I'd never actually seen Ran be anything even remotely resembling patient. Maybe she wouldn't enjoy fishing very much after all..."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:90

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Believe it or not, I'm confident in my concentration. I'll pull in everything out there, even the ocean depths.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:91

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'm not sure if you can call that fishing...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:92

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I'm gonna surprise the hell out of all those fishermen! I'll catch so much that the market price will double by the end of the day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:96

msgid "Our fishing spot was at the rocks by the cliff. It seems it's best to fish there at full tide, but we could still fish a decent amount at low tide."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:97

msgid "We set up the rods for the girls and help them cast their lines."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:100

msgid "{Andou}\n\"Hey, do something about this!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:101

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What is it?\nHave you caught something already?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:102

msgid "{Andou}\n\"The fish hook caught on my skirt. Take it out, take it out!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:103

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, that's too bad. I thought you might have already got a fish on your line.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:104

msgid "It had only been five minutes. It was way too soon for anybody to get lucky."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:105

msgid "{Andou}\n\"Can someone help me out?\nACK! My skirt!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:106

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Just stay calm. Nobody wants to see that!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:107

msgid "I could see her wearing black ones today. It reminded me of the pair I accidentally put on my head when we first arrived on the island."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:110

msgid "{Andou}\n\"Hey!\nDon't go looking up my skirt!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:111

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I swear on my life that I will never look up your skirt.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:112

msgid "{Andou}\n\"That sounds rude.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:116

msgid "{Ran}\n\"You're being way too loose, Kazushi. I know you're young and it's gonna happen, but at least pick a decent girl.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:117

msgid "She was whispering, but that was too rude."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:118

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"If she heard that, you'd be in Davy Jones' locker.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:121

msgid "{Ran}\n\"By the way, if you want to see some underwear, how about mine?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:122

msgid "She gave me a friendly wink, but I knew what she wanted."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:123

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"But you're charging, right? No deal.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:126

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Ahaha, you knew.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:127

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Look, you're a young girl. You shouldn't be trying to make money off that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:132

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Kazushi, you're so stiff. How about I take that deal?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:133

msgid "He may sound like he's joking, but he's being serious."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:134

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I thought you weren't interested in panties.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:137

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"There's a difference between panties and panties when they're still on the girl.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:138

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I see.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:139

msgid "That makes sense.\nHe's a genius."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:142

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"So, how much are you going to charge me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:143

msgid "He sounded happier than ever."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:146

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Sorry, deal's closed.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:147

msgid "Ran quickly withdrew the offer. Pierre was seriously disappointed."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:150

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Why? I promise I'll pay.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:151

msgid "{Ran}\n\"That offer was only for Kazushi.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:154

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Whaddaya mean?\nYou aren't offering that to anybody besides Kazushi?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:155

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What? Just for me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:158

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Umm......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:159

msgid "The person who was shocked the most by that statement was actually Ran herself. I tilted my head in confusion and looked at Pierre."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:162

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I didn't mean that Kazushi is more special than anybody else.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:163

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"But that's how it is? You'll show him, but no one else?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:164

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I don't know why either.\nI just feel so comfortable with him.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:165

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What do you mean?\nAre you saying I'm one of the girls?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:168

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Ahaha, nice one! I bet you'd look good in drag!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:169

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"That's not what I was asking.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:172

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"I think she's changing the subject.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:174

msgid "Pierre shrugged his shoulders and stepped away. He looked even more disappointed."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:177

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Look what you did to Pierre. Don't offer something if you can't make good on it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:180

msgid "{Ran}\n\"But I couldn't actually show him. Kazushi, would it be all right with you if I showed other guys my panties?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:181

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Why are you asking me that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:182

msgid "I tried to imagine her showing her underwear to Pierre."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:183

msgid "Ran lifting her skirt up as Pierre watched with a really happy grin, leaning in so close his nose nearly touched."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:184

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:187

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What do you think?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:188

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"......I don't like it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:189

msgid "{Ran}\n\"What exactly do you mean by \"you don't like it\"?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:190

msgid "It was hard for me to answer. I didn't know."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:191

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I don't know why, but I don't want you doing that. You shouldn't go trying to make money that way.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:192

msgid "{Ran}\n\"That's why I'm not doing it!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:193

msgid "I didn't even know why we were arguing."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:197

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"OMIGODYOUGUYS!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:198

msgid "All of a sudden, Mizuki screamed."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:205

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"K-Kazushi! Kazushi! Wh-why is this rod moving?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:206

msgid "Mizuki's rod was bending like a large bow. She was trying to use all her weight to stabilise her fishing pole."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:207

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You've caught a big one!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:212

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Yes! It must be a big one.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:213

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Huh? What? You mean I hooked one? Wh-what do I do?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:214

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Just hang in there!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:217

msgid "I ran over and grabbed onto her rod from behind."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:220

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"What are you doing!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:221

msgid "Mizuki voice cracked. Probably because I had my arms around her from behind."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:222

msgid "I have to press her body into mine just so that we could keep the fish on the line."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:223

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Just deal with it for a second!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:226

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"All right!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:227

msgid "I tried reeling in her fishing pole and it went crazy."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:235

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"It's really big. Be careful that the line doesn't break.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:236

msgid "{Andou}\n\"Go, Mizuki-chan!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:237

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Go Mizuki-chan! Go Haruma-kun!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:243

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I'm doing my best!\nWhy does it have to be me!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:244

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"It means the ocean loves you, Mizuki!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:247

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"You think so?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:252

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Stop acting cool, Kazushi.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:253

msgid "I didn't have time to reply to Ran's complaints."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:258

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Hang in there, you two!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:262

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Hey, Kazushi-kun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:263

msgid "Haruka was all excited."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:264

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Should I start getting that ready?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:265

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What is it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:268

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"I'm talking about ink, of course. Do you want some?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:269

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Ink? Why would I need that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:272

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Don't fishermen keep records of the fish they've caught by using ink to show how big they are on paper?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:273

msgid "I think she's talking about fishing prints. I'm surprised that she knows about those."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:274

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"All right.\nHaruka, I'll leave the ink to you. It's an important job, so be careful.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:277

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Got it! I'm a third-degree in calligraphy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:278

msgid "To be honest, I only asked her in order to keep her busy and away from where she might bother me."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:282

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"It's pulling me so hard!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:283

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Shit! It's a strong one!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:284

msgid "I felt like I was trying to pull up the entire Earth itself."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:290

msgid "{Appo}\n\"What if after all this excitement it's just a log?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:291

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"It can't be. It's moving.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:296

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I can't keep going anymore!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:297

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Just a little longer!\nHe's getting tired, too!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:298

msgid "It was just as strong as ever, but it was moving more slowly."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:299

msgid "It had been whipping about trying to shake us off, but now it was calming down."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:303

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Here it comes!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:304

msgid "All of a sudden, the fishing pole felt lighter. We pulled the line into the air."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:308

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Wow......!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:314

msgid "The ocean surface swelled up, and then out jumped a giant fish."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:321

msgid "{Appo}\n\"So huge!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:322

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Unreal......\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:323

msgid "We couldn't believe what we saw.\nIt was so huge......"
msgstr ""

#: 03303:330

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Wh-what was that? Was that a fish?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:331

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"It's a miracle that the fishing pole hasn't broken!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:335

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Hold on! Let me make your fishing pole and line stronger!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:343

msgid "Haruka poured some kind of solution on the pole and it shone for a moment."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:344

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"It should be stronger now!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:348

msgid "{Andou}\n\"Then we can pull as hard as we want, right? Everyone, let's pull it together!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:356

msgid "Andou and Daigo joined us in our efforts to reel in the fish."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:357

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"OH YEAH!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:358

msgid "The fishing line was sounded like it was being stretched to its limits. It could snap at any second."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:364

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Don't worry guys, it's not going to snap!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:372

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hoooooooooh!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:373

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Hoooooooooooh!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:374

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Here it is!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:375

msgstr ""

#: 03303:384

msgid "{Appo}\n\"It's out!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:385

msgid "The huge creature flew high up into the air and started falling. Andou dashed into the shallows to catch it."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:389

msgid "{Andou}\n\"Bring it!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:391

msgid "Andou caught the beast in her massive arms."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:395

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Yes!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:396

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"We did it!!\""

#: 03303:400

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I did it? I did it? Yes!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:401

msgid "Mizuki got so excited, she couldn't help hugging me."

#: 03303:402

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I can't believe I caught such a huge fish!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:403

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Mizuki, I know you're happy, but I can't breathe...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:404

msgid "And I could feel her soft and squishy bits..."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:411

msgid "{Ran}\n *AHEM*"
msgstr ""

#: 03303:412

msgid "Ran gave an obvious cough and stared at me."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:416

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"Oops.\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:418

msgid "Mizuki hid herself behind me to avoid Ran's wrath."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:421

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Why are you staring at me like that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:422

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Is this what you were talking about when you said I'd need to be patient today?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:423

msgid "Ran mumbled her disapproval."
msgstr ""

#: 03303:424

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What do you mean?\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:427

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I'm saying that I don't get why I have to put up with watching you like that.\""

msgstr ""

#: 03303:431

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Why am I so upset?\nI can't control my feelings......\""
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: 03303:436

msgid "{Ran}\n\"Umm......?\""

#: 03303:439

msgid "{Ran}\n\"I'm kinda feeling woozy...\""
msgstr ""

#: 03303:440

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You're feeling dizzy? You're not getting heatstroke, are you?\""
