msgstr ""

#: 02304:10

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"It's not like I had any goal in mind.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:12

msgid "I stopped dead."
msgstr ""

#: 02304:13

msgid "Why didn't I just go after Haruka or Mizuki?"
msgstr ""

#: 02304:14

msgid "Am I cursed?"
msgstr ""

#: 02304:15

msgid "Or am I just not interested in picking up chicks?"
msgstr ""

#: 02304:16

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Maybe that's it. Maybe I've been single for so long that I've lost interest in girls.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:17

msgid "I felt dizzy."
msgstr ""

#: 02304:18

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I can't see straight...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:19

msgid "I was just a little disoriented, so I laid down under the shade of a tree."

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:28

msgid "Somebody woke me up just when I was falling asleep."
msgstr ""

#: 02304:31

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Oh, it's you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:32

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Oh, hey Natsume-chan.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:33

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"So you weren't...a corpse.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:34

msgid "This is just like when we first met. She thought I was dead then, too."
msgstr ""

#: 02304:35

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You don't usually find dead people under trees.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:38

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"It's not my fault you're always falling asleep in public. It's suspicious.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:39

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You've got a point.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:40

msgid "She's right. Falling asleep here isn't appropriate, and it doesn't look much better than when young street rats crouch on the street."

#: 02304:52

msgid "But today she actually seemed quiet."
msgstr ""

#: 02304:55

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"So...how've you been?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:56

msgid "It's unusual for her to start a conversation like this. Maybe she's finally opening up to me. It was touching."
msgstr ""

#: 02304:57

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I actually got into serious trouble with the principal. We have to do some kind of alternative task instead of taking our finals.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:60

msgstr ""

#: 02304:73

msgid "She seems to be rather antagonistic towards the principal."
msgstr ""

#: 02304:74

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"If she ever tries to hurt you, I promise that I will make her miserable.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:75

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Wow, you're dependable.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:76

msgid "But she seemed to be physically very weak."
msgstr ""

#: 02304:79

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"You don't believe me? I'll show you the Natsume Beam.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02304:80

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Natsume Beam?\""
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: 02304:99

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"It slipped? ...What happened to your beam?\""
