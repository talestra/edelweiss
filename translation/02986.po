"\"Oh, that? You still have dreams about that?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02986:161
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"I don't blame you for being traumatized. Losing your virginity to an ancient hooker like that...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02986:164
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"That's not true! I wasn't in completely and I didn't come!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02986:167
msgid ""
"{Daigo}\n"
"\"So that means you're still a virgin, same as us.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02986:170
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"That's not entirely true either! My tip was in, so I'm not a virgin.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02986:171
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Which one is it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02986:176
msgid "Pierre had decided enough was enough one day, and went to a brothel by himself to lose his virginity."
msgstr ""

#: 02986:177
msgid "The doorman screwed him over, though, and he wound up with an 83 year old prostitute as his first sexual partner."
msgstr ""

#: 02986:179
msgid "As soon as Pierre realized his conquest wasn't going to be the young girl he was promised, his memory shut down and he blacked out. What we do know is that he came before he got it in all the way."
msgstr ""

#: 02986:181
msgid "If that counts as his first time, then technically he's no longer a virgin."
msgstr ""

#: 02986:182
msgid "But in that case, it means his first sex partner was a prostitute old enough to be his grandmother."
msgstr ""

#: 02986:183
msgid "If it doesn't count, then he's still a virgin."
msgstr ""

#: 02986:184
msgid "He doesn't want to be identified as a virgin, but he doesn't want to admit that was his first time either. We call this \"Pierre's Paradox\"."
msgstr ""

#: 02986:190
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Who cares! Let's just say that you're not a virgin.\""

msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 02986:229

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I don't think so...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02986:233

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, it's not like you've tried every girl.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02986:236
msgid "Maybe that was bad advice. What if he tried to hit on every single girl here and still failed?"
msgstr ""
