msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgid ""
"{Andou}\n"

msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Why are you guys staring at me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01906:184
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"Because you're the one who's got a chance. Fuusen's heart is all yours.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01906:185
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"Stop that. It was in my dead granny's will not to talk about Fuusen Kazuko after dark.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01906:186
msgid ""
"{Pierre}\n"
"\"What kind of superstition is that? What's wrong with Fuusen Kazuko. No need to be that cruel to her.\""
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: 01906:195
msgid ""
"{Appo}\n"
"\"That's only when the girl looks good! Have you seen her face? Go out with that? What kind of lab-rat am I?!\""
