msgstr ""

#: 00604:30

msgstr ""

#: 00604:35

#: 00604:36

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"...the fuck?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:37

msgid "{Appo}\n\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:38

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"This is hell.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:54

msgid "I put my hands over my ears and hid under my bed covers. It's almost nine o'clock; still too early to sleep."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:55

msgid "{Kazushi}\n *yawn*"
msgstr ""

#: 00604:56

msgid "I stretched myself out. Every since I got here, I feel like I've been sleepy every day."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:57

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Maybe I'm just tired.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:58

msgid "Mentally. Maybe spending every day surrounded by women like this is forcing me to be more nervous than ever."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:59

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I should go to bed early tonight.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:62

msgid "I closed my eyes."

msgstr ""

#: 00604:68

msgid "Somebody's outside."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:69

msgid "It wasn't that late, so it wouldn't be odd, but for some reason those footsteps made me curious."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:70

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Who could that be?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:71

#: 00604:72

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"That's......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:73

msgid "What is she doing out there at this time again? My drowsiness quickly went away."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:77

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Natsume-chan?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:80

msgid "When I called out to her, she turned around with her usual expressionless face."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:83

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Oh, it's you, Haruma.\nI'm tired of seeing your face.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:84

msgid "She was already fed up with me."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:85

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Already? We've only seen each other a few times.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:86

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"And I'm already sick of you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:87

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Already? That's too fast.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:88

msgid "That was all she had to say, and then she seemed to lose interest in me. She kept her eyes on her feet as she started walking away."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:89

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Why are you taking a walk at this time of night, anyways?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:90

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"No reason.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:91

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"There's got to be a reason.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:94

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:95

msgid "She ignored me. She must think I'm nagging her. Oh well, I'm used to the cold shoulder."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:96

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"You're sure a night-owl, Natsume-chan. Didn't I meet you for the first time around this time of night? Are you able to get up OK in the morning?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:97

msgid "She turned around."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:100

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Shut up, Haruma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:101

msgid "She scolded me. I guess she didn't want to be lectured."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:102

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Could it be that you're looking for something?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:103

msgid "That's the only thing I could think she was doing."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:104

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"If you're looking for something, I'll help. Is it something important?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:107

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:108

msgid "She stopped and looked at me."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:111

msgid "...and took a big sigh."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:112

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I don't remember doing anything to make you sigh.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:113

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"And that's one reason why you're stupid, Haruma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:114

msgid "She nodded her head."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:115

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Stop talking to me like that!\nI'm your sempai, so show me some respect!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:118

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:119

msgid "Oops, I think I said that too loud."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:122

msgid "{Natsume}\n\".........sniff.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:123

msgid "She started shaking."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:124

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Hh......sniff.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:125

msgid "Then her eyes started to get watery. This makes it look I'm bullying her."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:126

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Don't cry, okay?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:127

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"I'm not......crying......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:128

msgid "She's already half crying."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:129

msgid "I hope no one's watching this."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:130

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Please don't cry.\nI promise I won't raise my voice again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:131

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"I'm not crying......don't treat me like a kid......stupid......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:132

msgid "She rubbed her eyes as she insulted me. The tip of her nose was getting red. She was clearly crying."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:133

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I'm sorry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:134

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Don't apologize! I didn't cry so, why are you apologizing?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:135

msgid "She refused to admit she was crying. What a stubborn girl. I'm glad she has yet to realize that tears are a woman's weapon."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:136

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Here, let me help you look for it as penance.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:137

msgid "I didn't know what she was looking for but I started looking around. I should be able to find it if she dropped something."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:138

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Hey, could you tell me what you dropped? It's hard to look if I don't know.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:141

msgid "She gave me another big sigh at my persistence."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:142

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"If you really want to help me......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:145

msgid "Her pure eyes caught my eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:146

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Find me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:147

msgid "I didn't understand what she meant, but her eyes were telling me she was serious."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:148

msgid "What did she mean by \"find me\"?"
msgstr ""

#: 00604:149

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Find you what?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:152

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Find. Me. What else?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:153

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"But Natsume-chan, you're...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:154

msgid "She was right in front of me."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:155

msgid "I didn't say it, because I realized she'd tell me that thought was stupid. Maybe it's some kind of metaphor?"
msgstr ""

#: 00604:158

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"If you can't understand what I mean then don't bother. It's impossible for you, Haruma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:159

msgid "Natsume-chan looked dejected. Her voice was quiet too."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:160

msgid "But I didn't understand what Natsume-chan meant. What part of Natsume-chan am I supposed to find?"
msgstr ""

#: 00604:161

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"All right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:162

msgid "I don't know what she means, but I'll remember this."
msgstr ""

#: 00604:165

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"You can forget about it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:166

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"No, I'll be sure to remember it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00604:167

msgid "I may not understand now, but there will come a day when I do. I'll remember what she said tonight so I can be ready when it comes."
