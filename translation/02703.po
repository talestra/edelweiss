"I went by her dorm, but she wasn't in her room.\n"
"I wonder where she is so late at night?"

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:12
msgid "I sensed someone in the dark."

#: 02703:13
msgid "I saw shadows in the corner of the quad."

"{Ran}\n"
"\"Why do you need me so late at night?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:17
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's Ran's voice.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:18
msgid ""
"I could tell it was her voice.\n"
"There was someone else with her - a guy I didn't recognize."

#: 02703:19
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What are they doing here so late?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:20
msgid "I don't know why, but I couldn't help hiding behind a bush and watching them."

"{Guy}\n"
"\"Umm...are you going out with anyone right now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:22
msgid ""
"Wow......!!\n"
"Is he asking her out?"
msgstr ""

#: 02703:25
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What? Sure I am.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:26
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What!?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:28
msgid ""
"Ack, I need to stay quiet.\n"
"...wait, did she just say \"yes\"?"

#: 02703:29
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Who is she talking about?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:30
msgid ""
"I didn't know that Ran had a boyfriend.\n"
"I mean, she didn't have to tell me, but I wonder who he is."

#: 02703:31
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What is this feeling?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:34
msgid ""
"{Guy}\n"
"\"Who's your boyfriend?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:35
msgid "That's right. Ask her. I need to know."

#: 02703:38
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What's it to you? If you plan on taking much longer, I'll start charging by the hour.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:39
msgid ""
"{Guy}\n"
"\"You're gonna charge me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:40
msgid "I don't blame him for being surprised. Who'd want to pay to get a chance at asking a girl out?"
msgstr ""

#: 02703:41
msgid ""
"{Guy}\n"
"\"All right! I'll pay 1000 yen! At least tell me who you're going out with!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:42
msgid "He's actually paying her!? That guy is seriously paying Ran 1000 yen just to find out who her boyfriend is?"
msgstr ""

#: 02703:45
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"1000 yen?\n"
"All right, deal. Give it to me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:48
msgid "The guy handed Ran 1,000 yen and she was all smiles. This is so wrong."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:49
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Thank you, come again! Now, lend me your ear.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:51
msgid "She whispered into his ear. Shit! I can't hear it."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:52
msgid ""
"{Guy}\n"
"\"I knew it! I knew you two were more than just friends.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:55
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Well, that's how it is, so give up on me. In exchange, I'll introduce you to another girl. There's this cute first year - wanna see her picture?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:56
msgid ""
"{Guy}\n"
"\"Wow! She's pretty? You've gotta introduce us!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:57
msgid "He wants Ran to introduce him to another girl? What kind of man asks the girl who just rejected him to arrange a hookup with someone else?"
msgstr ""

#: 02703:60
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"That'll be 3000 yen for the introduction. I can set you up with a date for 5980 yen.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:61
msgid "She's charging him again. A pretty high rate too."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:62
msgid ""
"{Guy}\n"
"\"I want a date, please!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:63

#: 02703:66
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"

#: 02703:67
msgid ""
"{Guy}\n"
"\"Yes! I'm gonna score a home run!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:69
msgid "That guy went home so happy that even I felt ashamed. What the hell did he come here for."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:71
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"It feels good to help people.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:72
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You call that \"helping people\"?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:73
msgid "I couldn't help wanting to lecture her."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:78
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oh, hey Kazushi. What's up?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:79
msgid "She didn't seem to have any guilty feelings whatsoever."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:80
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I was watching the whole thing.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:83
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"You were? Don't worry, I rejected him.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:84
msgid "She doesn't look like she just broke someone's heart."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:85
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You are such a terrible person.\n"
"How could you introduce another girl to someone you just rejected AND charge them for it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:88
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Why is that so bad? My customer went home happy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:89
msgid "In her mind, he's only a customer."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:90
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I can't go out with him, and he didn't care who it was - he just wanted a girlfriend to spend summer with. Leading him to his next chance is better than leaving him dumped.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:91
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, I see your point.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:92
msgid "Maybe she really did act with an altruistic purpose."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:93
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"By the way, who's the guy you're seeing?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:94
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"The guy I'm seeing?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:95
msgid "She responded like she had no idea what I was talking about."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:96
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You know, you just charged that poor guy 1000 yen to find out who your boyfriend was.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:99
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Oh, that? I was talking about you, Kazushi.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:100
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What? Me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:101
msgid "I see. That means she's going out with me."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:102
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wait a minute, are we going out?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:105
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Kind of.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:106
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Kind of?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:107
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Telling them you've already got a boyfriend is the quickest way to make guys give up. It also helps lead them into things like just now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:108
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"So you're using my name to make some quick cash.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:111
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Don't get so upset about it. Besides, I really do like you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:112
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm not sure if I should be happy about that or not.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:113
msgid "According to Ran, she had to reject guys all the time. I didn't know she was so popular..."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:114
msgid "But then, she doesn't seem to have any interest in going out with the boys either. Maybe she's actually a lesbian?"
msgstr ""

#: 02703:117
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What are you thinking so hard about? Loosen up and take a walk with me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:120
msgid ""
"She looped her arm around mine and held my hand.\n"
"I could feel her breasts squishing against my arms."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:123
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"You should feel honoured. You're the only guy I don't charge for this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:124
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm still not sure if I should be happy about this or not.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:125
msgid "With Ran, I don't even get turned on when we're this close and going for a walk. But that's also probably why I feel so relaxed around her."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:126
msgid "However, I definitely want a girlfriend before summer break."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:127
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, hey, would you introduce me to some girls, too?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:130
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What? Why?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:131
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You wanted 3000 yen, right? I don't mind paying that...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:132
msgid ""
"I checked inside my wallet.\n"
"My budget is pretty tight right now."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:133
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What? You want a girlfriend?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:134
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Why's that such a surprise?\n"
"Why do you think we all came to this island? All of us wanted to meet girls.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:137
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I see. I didn't know you were such a normal guy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:138
msgid "For some reason she sounded disappointed."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:139
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"You shouldn't worry about finding a girlfriend so much. I can see you falling for the wrong girl and letting her soak you for all your cash.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:140
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I can't believe a business oriented girl like you is saying things like that. Just show me some of the pictures... I prefer first years, by the way.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:143
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"No. No, no, no. This is not a service for someone like you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:144
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Why not? Do you want me to be a loser forever?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:147
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Don't worry. I'll make you happy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:148
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That sounds like it's out of my price range.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:149
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Maybe you should start saving while you've got the chance.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02703:150
msgid "I was really looking forward to her introducing me to some pretty girls."
msgstr ""

#: 02703:151
msgid ""
"Oh well.\n"
"I'm happy enough for now."
