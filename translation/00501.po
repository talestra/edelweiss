msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Let's go this way.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:56

msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

"{Haruka}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00501:90

#: 00501:101
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I'm glad you liked it.\n"

#: 00501:102
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: 00501:103

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

#: 00501:105
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Oh come on, it's not poisoned.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:106
msgid "But still, can you make a bento with alchemy? She didn't slip some dangerous drug in did she?"
msgstr ""

#: 00501:107
msgid "I fearfully tried another bite."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:108
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00501:109
msgid "I mean it's REALLY delicious."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:110
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"See? It tastes good, doesn't it?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:111
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yeah, it tastes amazing! I didn't know alchemy could do things like this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:112
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Alchemy is used to sublimate an object into its perfect state. By using alchemy, a plain, ordinary dish can be made into something delicious like this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:113
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's really useful.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:114
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"The motto we hold to the alchemy we study at this academy is 'be useful in everyday life'. It's not suspicious like black magic or anything.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:115
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Oh, I see. I think black magic is the exact image I had of it. To be honest, I thought it was something sinister.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:116
msgid "I had an image of three witches making some kind of potion in the basement."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:117
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Everybody thinks that way in the beginning. Are you getting interested now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:118
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Actually, I am.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:119
msgid "Practical alchemy, huh? I wonder what they'll be teaching us. It might be pretty fun."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:120
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I was so sure you'd be interested in alchemy, Kazushi-kun. I hoped you would be.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:121
msgid "I felt like there was something more behind those words of hers. She sounded like she wanted to make me interested in alchemy."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:122
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Keep eating. Soon you'll be able to use alchemy to make your own lunches like this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:123
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wow, that's really convenient...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:124
msgid "Is it? Is it convenient to use alchemy to cook good food? ...It certainly is useful alchemy, though."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:125
msgid "But more importantly, if you want to make tasty food, shouldn't you just learn to cook?"
msgstr ""

#: 00501:129
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"What's wrong?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:130
msgid "She gave me a worried look."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:131
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Does everything taste right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:132
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No, no. Everything tastes amazing. It all tastes like something that might be served at a high class restaurant. Not that I know what that actually tastes like.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:133
msgid "It's really good. But for some reason, the taste seems to diminish the more I eat."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:134
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:137
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"W-what is it? Did I say something wrong?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:138
msgid "She's worried because I stopped eating and started to think, but I can't explain cooking well either."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:139
msgid "So then..."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:140
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Do you think we could use the school's kitchen?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:141
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"The one in the cafeteria? Now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:142
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yeah, now. Lunch is almost over so everyone should be gone, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:145
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I suppose so. I don't think they'd mind, but why do you need to use the kitchen?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:146
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Your lunch was so good that it's inspired me to do some cooking.\""
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: 00501:158
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yes! I made it in time!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:160
msgid "I jumped out from the kitchen with a dish I prepared for her."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:161
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Actually you didn't make it in time.\n"
"Lunch is long over.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:162
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But you're still hungry, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:163
msgid "I placed the dish down in front of her. It was the one dish I could cook, omurice."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:166
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Wow!?\n"
"You made this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:167
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yeah. It's actually edible.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:170
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"It looks so good!\n"
"But I don't have time to eat.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:171
msgid "Haruka kept glancing at the clock. As thick-headed as she can be sometimes, she's still earnest and punctual. You could even say she's a stickler for rules."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:172
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's okay to be a little late. What's one or two hours compared to our long lives?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:173
msgid "I forced the spoon into her hand."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:174
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Bon appetit.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:175
msgid "I stared straight at her and wouldn't let her object. Haruka finally gave in with a sigh."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:178
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Oh, all right. I didn't know that you had an aggressive streak.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:179
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's because we've only met just recently. There's still a lot we don't know about each other.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:182
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"OK. First I'll find out if you're as good of a cook as you say.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:183

msgstr ""

#: 00501:188
msgid "She gave me a look of surprise."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:191
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Yeah... It's really good! Did you actually make this, Kazushi-kun?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:192
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I see, it's good, huh? It's good enough that you're doubting my integrity?\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Sorry.\n"
"But....this is so yummy!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:198
msgid "She started wolfing it down like there was no tomorrow."

msgstr ""

#: 00501:200

msgstr ""

#: 00501:201
msgid ""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm glad you liked it too.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:205

"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Yeah, it really is very delicious. It's your little sister's favourite?\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"She liked it enough to eat it every day.\""

#: 00501:209
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 00501:210
msgid "She started tossing questions out my way."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:211
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Only for a bit. We had some family issues to sort out a while back, so we kept having bentos and take-out, but...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:212
msgid "Because of mental stress from those issues, and also because she was sick of take-out, my sister stopped eating."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:213
msgid "When that happened, I tried making all kinds of things to get her to eat something, but she refused them all. When I was at my wits end, I made omurice."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:214
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I still failed on my first attempt. But despite my big failure, my omurice was the first thing she ate.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:215
msgid "She went on and on about how awful it was. I got so fed up with hearing that that I practiced making it. Now, it's the one dish that I can feel confident in making."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:216
msgid "I was confident because even though my sister refused to eat gourmet sushi or food from famous restaurants, the one thing she would eat was my omurice."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:219
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Oh... I see...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:220
msgid "I explained this all to Haruka without going into much detail about our family crisis, but thankfully she didn't pry into it. She's actually quite considerate."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:221
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"So it tastes this good because you put your heart into learning how to make it for someone. No wonder it has a comforting taste.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:222
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm not sure about that, but I did do my best to make it so you would enjoy it.\""

msgstr ""

#: 00501:226
msgid "She got my point."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:227
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"I wonder, is that something you can't do with alchemy?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:228
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Who knows? I sure don't. But I do think you can make good food without relying on alchemy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:231
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"You're right. If I want to cook good food, I should just practice hard and do my best.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:234
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"Maybe I've been depending too much on alchemy for everything I do.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:235
msgid "She stared at her hands with a self-deprecating smile."
msgstr ""

#: 00501:238
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"The truth is, I'm horrible at cooking. I learned alchemy before anything else like cooking.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:239
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"When I first cooked something, it came out terrible. But with alchemy, it was easy to turn into something good.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:240
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
"\"That's why I never really learned how to cook. I never had to try and learn how to do it through trial and error.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:241
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I had to struggle so much just to perfect one dish. But when I finally did, I was really happy.\""

msgstr ""

#: 00501:250
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"

"But boys tend not to have such refined tastes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00501:261
msgid ""
"{Haruka}\n"
