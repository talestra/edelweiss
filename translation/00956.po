msgid "{Principal}\n\"Let me try it with you this time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:10

msgid "The principal sat down next to me."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:11

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Try it with you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:14

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Yes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:15

msgid "She gave me a gentle smile. She seems kind, but she makes me uncomfortable. Now I'm nervous too."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:18

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Just follow the same steps as you learned before.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:19

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yes, ma'am.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:21

msgid "I went through the same steps one more time. I put the ingredients in and lit the flame."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:22

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Like this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:24

msgid "The liquid inside the flask began to boil. Bubbles shook the surface of the water as if they were reflecting my tension."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:25

msgid "{Principal}\n\"You need to relax more. If you're too tense, it will be harder to fuse the ingredients.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:26

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Yes, ma'am.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:27

msgid "I took a few big breaths. Deep breaths. Deep breaths are what I needed."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:28

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Ahhh, uhhhn.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:31

msgid "I smelled something pretty as I inhaled."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:32

msgid "It was the flowers."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:35

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Very good. You're doing much better now.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:36

msgid "The principal looked into the flask and smiled. The liquid inside displayed signs of intense convection, but only gentle waves appeared on the surface."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:39

msgid "{Principal}\n\"The two ingredients we used hold 'shadow' and 'light', or 'male' and 'female' properties. In alchemy we call this 'King' and 'Queen'.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:40

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"'King' and 'Queen'?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:41

msgid "The name comes from people? That's an interesting way to name them, but I can see where they get it from."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:44

msgid "{Principal}\n\"This goes in next.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:45

msgid "It's the flowers. I made it this far last time, too."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:46

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Here goes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:47

msgid "I grabbed the flower."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:48

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Ow...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:49

msgid "I felt a shock, like static electricity, in my fingertips."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:50

msgid "I nearly stopped myself, but I felt the principal's eyes on me so I put it in."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:51

msgid "The solution was turning black inside the flask."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:54

msgid "{Principal}\n\"This is the stage where the substances each meet their death.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:55

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Death...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:56

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Yes, death. The substances die inside this flask, and then...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:57

msgid "I watched the solution change color like watching a video on fast forward."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:58

msgid "{Principal}\n\"They are born anew.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:59

msgid "Its turning white, now.\nIt's the perfect image of life and death."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:60

msgid "Born anew from the colour of a funeral."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:61

msgid "{Principal}\n\"The King and Queen die and are rise again. This is the stage at which they melt and blend together to create a new life.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:62

msgid "{Principal}\n\"We call this stage the philosophical marriage of the King and Queen.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:63

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Marriage? The terms are quite romantic.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:66

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Yes they are. Alchemy is full of romance.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:67

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I see.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:68

msgid "I'm impressed."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:69

msgid "As matter of a fact, changing lead into gold is kind of romantic."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:70

msgid "{Principal}\n\"And so the new life that they create will be able to shine on its own.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:71

msgid "The liquid inside began to turn red, like the dawning sky. At the center of the liquid, a gold sun began to appear."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:72

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Something's been solidified.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:73

msgid "It was like a little rock. The liquid glowed a transparent red, but it was more golden closer to the center."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:76

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Now, it is complete.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:79

msgid "The principal turned off the flame.\nShe stuck her fingers into the flask and picked up the golden rock."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:80

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Isn't it hot?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:83

msgid "{Principal}\n\"Go ahead and touch it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:84

msgid "She held it out in the palm of her hand."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:85

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"All right......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:86

msgid "I carefully touched it."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:87

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"It's not hot at all.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:88

msgid "Not only was it cool, but it wasn't hard as a rock, either. It was neither soft, nor hard, and held a living warmth."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:95

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Amazing, Kazushi-kun. It's a great success!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:96

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"This is the result?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:97

msgid "I didn't know what the outcome of the experiment was supposed to be."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:98

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"By the way...what is this?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:99

msgid "It appeared to be golden, but it sure wasn't gold."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:103

msgid "{Mei}\n\"Here you go, Principal.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:104

msgid "Mei-sensei brought over a pot. There was no flower in it; only dirt."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:105

msgid "The principal planted the golden orb in the dirt."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:109

msgid "{Principal}\n\"This is......\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:110

msgid "She poured some water in the pot as she continued her explanation.\nBefore she could finish, we saw a plant begin to sprout."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:111

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Wow!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:112

msgid "It was like watching magic. But then that orb is..."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:113

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"A seed?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:116

msgid "{Principal}\n\"That's exactly what it is.\nEverybody's assignment is to synthesize these and sow them in the garden.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:117

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I see.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:118

msgid "We're going to sow new seeds in the garden we ruined."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:119

msgid "{Principal}\n\"I doubt they'll bloom soon, but if everyone wishes for it, then I'm sure they'll bloom again one day.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:120

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"They will?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:121

msgid "Then we can make that garden full of blooming flowers once again."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:129

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"We're going to make a lot of seeds!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:130

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"But, can we really make them?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:131

msgid "{Appo}\n\"If at first you don't succeed...\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:141

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"I'll help you guys.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:142

msgid "{Mizuki}\n\"I guess I have to.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:143

msgid "{Fuusen}\n\"Well, it is for class.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:144

msgid "Whether by choice or force, the girls were going to help us out."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:145

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Thanks, girls!\nLet's do it!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:150

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Is this all?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:151

msgid "After school, we all sowed the seeds we made together."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:154

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"Do you think that's enough?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:155

msgid "We couldn't make hundreds of them, only about one per person in the class."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:160

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"It'll be alright.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:161

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:162

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Those flowers don't actually have seeds. They just grow up straight out of the ground. We don't really know how they do it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:169

msgid "{Pierre}\n\"Then what did we just sow in the ground? Weren't those seeds?\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:170

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"Those orbs aren't seeds; they're actually something of a fertilizer. They fertilize the soil and make it easier for the flowers to bloom.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:171

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"The flowers tend to grow near places where alchemical power gathers.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:172

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Huh, that's a weird flower.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:175

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"It's alright. I'm sure they'll bloom again.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:176

msgid "I looked over the neatly patted garden. I can't wait to see this place covered in flowers again."
msgstr ""

#: 00956:179

msgid "{Daigo}\n\"I will make some more and sow them whenever I have free time.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:180

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Good idea.\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:181

msgid "{Haruka}\n\"I'll help you guys, too!\""
msgstr ""

#: 00956:182

msgid "It's probably going to be our will more than anything else which will ultimately bring the flowers back into bloom."
