msgstr ""

#: 01834:9

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"I see. You're starting to look cute, Haruma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:10

msgid "Is it because I'm stupid? It made me feel pitiful when she treated me like a kid."
msgstr ""

#: 01834:11

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Don't treat me like a kid in front of everyone else, OK?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:14

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"You don't want to be treated like a kid? Did your parents treat you like a kid?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:15

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Well, yeah, back when I WAS a kid. How about your parents...\""

msgstr ""

#: 01834:17

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Where's your Papa now, then?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "Where could that damn man be? Leaving his cute daughter all alone on an island like this..."
msgstr ""

#: 01834:19

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"He's on this island.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:20

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What? You mean he's here on the island?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:21

msgid "That was an unexpected answer. That meant there shouldn't be any problems, right?"
msgstr ""

#: 01834:22

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Then you should be able to see him any time you want, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:23

msgid "It's a small island and hell, they both live here. Given how often Natsume-chan and I bump into each other it should be easy for those two to see each other."
msgstr ""

#: 01834:26

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"He wouldn't see me if I tried to visit.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:27

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"What? Why? You went to go see him, right?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:28

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"I did, but he ran away from me.\""

msgstr ""

#: 01834:33

msgid "Natsume-chan started pouting. She wasn't acting like her usual aloof self; she was just an ordinary girl right now."
msgstr ""

#: 01834:36

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Papa hates me. That's why he disappeared from me. That's why he won't see me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:37

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"That's not true.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:38

msgid "I didn't know what kind of problems they had between them, but I had to say that."
msgstr ""

#: 01834:41

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"What do you know, Haruma?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:42

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Maybe I don't, but he's your only father. There isn't a father on Earth that doesn't care about his own child.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:45

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Then why won't he see me? Why would he leave me?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:46

msgid "It was like we were regressing through the years because Natsume-chan was acting like a little girl."
msgstr ""

#: 01834:47

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"I wouldn't know that either, but all I can say is that your father loves you.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:48

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"......that's a lie.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:49

#: 01834:57

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"..................\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:58

msgid "Natsume-chan thought for a moment. I thought that she was scared her father might run away and never look at her again."
msgstr ""

#: 01834:59

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Don't worry! Believe in me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:62

msgid "{Natsume}\n\"Um...okay...this time you're going with me to meet my father too, Haruma.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01834:63

msgid "{Kazushi}\n\"Right. Got it.\""

#: 01834:64

msgid "I don't know what kind of parent this guy is, but if he's some nasty jerk, I'll give him a piece of my mind."
msgstr ""

#: 01834:65

msgid "But, I just can't think this guy is a villain because he's Natsume-chan's beloved father."
