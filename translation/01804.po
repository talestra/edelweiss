"\"Wait a minute, where am I going?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01804:12
msgid "Right, first question: Why am I even here? As I continued walking, I figured out that I didn't know where I was headed."

#: 01804:20
msgid "Natsume-chan slowed turned towards me when I called her. Her movement was almost mechanical, like a doll. She would be as cute as a doll if she didn't speak."

"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What are you doing here all by yourself?\""
msgstr ""

#: 01804:24
msgid "She's always alone. I'm worried about whether or not she really has any friends. I can't leave her on her own."

"{Natsume}\n"
"\"It's you again. Why do you keep coming here, Haruma? Is it a choice, or...\""
msgstr ""

#: 01804:28
msgid "I could tell that she was really trying to decipher something about me when she looked into my eyes. It made me uncomfortable."

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What can I say? It's a small island and we both live here. I'm pretty sure that we're bound to run into each other every now and then, right?\""

"{Natsume}\n"
"\"No, it's OK. Maybe you're right.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01804:55
msgid "I was surprised. Normally she wouldn't accept anything I said. This really isn't like her."
msgstr ""

#: 01804:56

#: 01804:65
msgid "Although Natsume-chan was right in front of me, her back seemed very small and distant. It was the first time I'd ever heard her mention her family."

"{Natsume}\n"
"\"Nothing is going to happen, even if you follow me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 01804:77
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"No, I'll go with you. Do you honestly think I'd just let someone who says she's fine on her own go without someone else beside her?\""

msgid ""
"{Natsume}\n"
"\"I told you, I'm okay. Stop being nosy.\""

msgstr ""

#: 01804:84
