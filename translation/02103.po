"{Ran}\n"
"\"Umm, not really.\n"
"It's a small island so I'm already tired of this place.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:11
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, I guess so.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:12
msgid "It's an island where you can explore the entire place in half a day. Other than the village and the school, everything is just a verdant forest."

#: 02103:13
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Is there anywhere you want to go, Kazushi?\n"
"I'll be your guide for today as a special service.\""

msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Yeah, let me think......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:15
msgid "I tried to think, but I couldn't come up with anywhere off the top of my head. I don't know how Ran interpreted my silence, but she looked at me and smiled."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:18
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"I see. Kazushi's also a man.\n"
"It's OK, then. Let me handle this.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:19
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What? What do you mean?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:20
msgid "I couldn't think of anything, so what kind of idea was she getting in her head?"
msgstr ""

#: 02103:21
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"It's OK, it's OK. Just let me handle it.\n"
"All you have to do is follow me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:22
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Well, if you say so...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:24
msgid "I wondered where she was taking me. Anyways, I began to follow her."

#: 02103:32
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Hey, where are we going here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:33
msgid ""
"Ran brought me to one of the baths.\n"
"It was the women's side."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:34
msgid "Of course, there wouldn't be any girls who'd come here in the middle of the afternoon."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:35
msgid "So, even if I go in, it'll be OK (barely). Otherwise, I'd be too afraid to enter."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:36
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What now?\n"
"Are you going to make me clean this place?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:39
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Shh! We'll get caught if you keep talking. Be quiet.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:40
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"We'll get caught......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:42
msgid ""
"There's nobody here. It wouldn't be good if someone came here, either.\n"
"And this time, there'll be nobody else to blame as a pervert."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:44
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"

msgstr ""

#: 02103:45
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Huh......?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:46
msgid "Someone's coming? That's a girl... Fujisaki-san?"
msgstr ""

#: 02103:49
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"They're coming. Hide.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:52
msgid "Ran shoved my head down and I ducked. I lowered my head and watched from the shadows. The pair followed immediately after."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:53
msgid "It was Sakura and Fujisaki-san."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:58
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"It's OK, there's nobody else here this time of day.\n"
"You don't have to hide yourself behind a towel.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:59
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"But it's so bright and embarrassing...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:60
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"What are you saying? We're both girls. Come on, hurry, hurry.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:62
msgid "It seemed like Sakura forcefully pulled Rin's towel off."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:63
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"H-hey, this isn't cool.\n"
"Let's sneak out of here while we still can.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:64
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What're you talking about?\n"
"You'd never get this kind of opportunity otherwise, so just watch.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:65
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Even though you say to just watch......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:66
msgid "There's two naked classmates in front of me and they're pretty. Of course I want to watch."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:67
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"But peeping is bad.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:68
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Rin's breasts are nice as usual.\n"
"Despite her face, she has a plump and sexy body, that girl.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:69
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Re-really?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:70
msgid "I want to look."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:71
msgid ""
"But......\n"
"I want to look."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:72
msgid "Dammit, my head can only think \"I want to look.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:73
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"She always covers herself up when she goes to the bath with me, but she's showing it all today. It's so weird. She doesn't need to hide if it's just us girls.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:74
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Isn't that because there are those who stare, just like you are now?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:75
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Hmm, Sakura's pretty hot too.\n"
"She's got a sweet butt that I want to nibble. Damn that's nice.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:76
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"You're a guy.\n"
"You're definitely a guy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:77
msgid "She was concentrating on their bodies more than I was. And she was licking her chops too."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:78
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"You should be watching too, Kazushi.\n"
"Hey, look! Look!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:79
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What......wow......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:80
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Hey, Sakura, stop...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:81
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Wow......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:82
msgid "Sakura poked Rin's breast. I was able to imagine how soft they were just by watching how deeply her finger went. The thought made me dizzy."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:83
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Hey, don't touch me there...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:84
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Why not?\n"
"It's just between us girls.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:85
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"It's wrong because it's between two girls.\n"
"It's weird.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:86
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Is it?\n"
"So you'd be OK with a guy then?\n"
"You'll let the guys do sexy things with you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:87
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"I--I'm not saying that. If it's a guy I liked then I'd probably let him...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:88
msgid "I started getting dizzy. The conversation took a turn for the explicit. If this keeps going, I won't stay sane."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:90
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"So, which guys in our class would you let touch you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:91
msgid ""
"I wanted to hear her answer on this topic.\n"
"Ran got her face in mine as a tease."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:92
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"You sure look interested, Kazushi.\n"
"Are you hoping she chooses you?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:93
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That's OK, isn't it? I'm curious. Maybe she'll choose me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:94
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Hahaha, there's no way. You're a nice guy, Kazushi, but you seem rather unreliable.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:95
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Shut up.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:96
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"The boys in class seem unreliable. I guess older men are just more mature.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:97
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Damn, so that's how it is...\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:98
msgid ""
"It was exactly as Ran thought.\n"
"She was wearing a victorious smile."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:99
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"How about a boy from the senior class or a teacher?\n"
"What about Yagami-sensei?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:100
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"He's hot, but he says he has a wife.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:101
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Then a senior?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:102
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"I think Iida-sempai is handsome.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:103
msgid ""
"Wow, Panchu-sempai.\n"
"Rin has good taste."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:104
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"But I can't understand a word he says, and isn't he kinda scary?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:105
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Sakura doesn't know anything about Panchu-sempai!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:106
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"But, if you look closely, he has very kind eyes.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:107
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Really? He's so scary that I never got close enough to look.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:108
msgid "Well, OK, even I never got close enough to his face to look at his eyes."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:109
msgid "Rin might be a really nice catch."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:110
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"How about the guys from our class? Like Harucchi?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:111
msgid "Oh, they're talking about me."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:112
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Haruma-kun......is a nice guy.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:113
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"That makes me sound so pathetic.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:114
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Nice guys finish last. Too bad.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:115
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Stop being so happy about it. It's weird.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:116
msgid ""
"I want to go home.\n"
"Why am I even here?"
msgstr ""

#: 02103:117
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"How about you, Sakura?\n"
"You're on good terms with Haruma-kun.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:118
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Yeah, I get along with him.\n"
"He's easy to talk to.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:119
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"You guys are always joking around.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:120
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"'Cause I never really think of him as the opposite sex.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:121
msgid ""
"I'm not thinking about Sakura as the opposite sex, either.\n"
"But maybe I don't have any masculine charm? I'll have to think about that."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:122
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"But aren't there those kinds of cases where two people are attracted to each other but don't realize it?\n"
"You know, like long term friends falling in love?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:123
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Ohhhh, I see.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:124
msgid "You see what?"
msgstr ""

#: 02103:125
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Then I should hook up with Harucchi?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:126
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Yeah, you two should get together.\n"
"If you become interested in a guy then I won't have to put up with you teasing me.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:127
msgid ""
"...That's my glowing recommendation from Fujisaki-san?\n"
"But isn't Sakura surprisingly up for it?"
msgstr ""

#: 02103:128
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"This is getting kinda weird.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:129
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It was weird from the start.\n"
"This sudden twist was totally unexpected, though.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:130
msgid "Sakura seemed to be seriously thinking the matter over."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:131
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Maybe Harucchi's not so bad.\n"
"However, I've never seen him in a romantic way, so I'll need a bit more time to think on it.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:132
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Yeah, yeah. You two should just take your time and move slowly.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:133
msgid "We should just take our time..."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:134
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What kind of scene is this? This is boring.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:135
msgid ""
"Ran seemed unsatisfied.\n"
"She probably didn't like the fact that I was feeling good about things."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:136
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What's so good about Kazushi?\n"
"I think I'll open their eyes a little.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:137
msgid "Then Ran suddenly tried to stand up."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:138
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"What the--!? Hey, stop!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:139
msgid ""
"If you do that, we'll get caught!\n"
"I tried to hold her back, but Ran leapt to her feet and dragged me over with her."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:141
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"Huh......?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:142
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"......Harucchi?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:143
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Um......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:144
msgid "I immediately made eye contact with her."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:145
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Um, this is......\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:146
msgid "The pair were so amazed that they even forgot to cover up their bodies. My eyes scrolled down by instinct. The two surprised girls noticed and regained consciousness."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:151
msgid ""
"{Sakura & Rin}\n"
"\"Ahh!!!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:160
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"I'm really sorry!!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:161
msgid ""
"I lowered my head as much as humanly possible.\n"
"I felt guilty."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:162
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"It's--It's OK, so you can raise your head.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:163
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Yeah. Let me guess, you were probably dragged along by Ran, right? Ran's the one to blame.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:164
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Thank you for saying that, and I'm really sorry!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:165
msgid "I'm glad they understood what was going on. Sakura was one matter, but I felt really sorry for scarring the innocent Fujisaki-san."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:168
msgid ""
"{Rin}\n"
"\"It's OK, really. But...\n"
"It's really embarrassing. Could you please forget everything you've seen and heard here?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:169
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"Of-of course!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:172
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Well, let's put the matter to rest and forget this ever happened.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:173
msgid ""
"{Kazushi}\n"
"\"It's really helpful that you suggested that.\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:174
msgid "I'm really glad they understood."
msgstr ""

#: 02103:179
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"Gosh, it seems like you're pretty okay with it.\n"
"Aren't you guys being too nice to Kazushi?\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:184
msgid ""
"{Sakura}\n"
"\"Why? This is all your fault. Think about how much emotional damage you've caused poor Rin-chan. I demand restitution!\""
msgstr ""

#: 02103:187
msgid ""
"{Ran}\n"
"\"What? Anything but that!\""
msgstr ""
