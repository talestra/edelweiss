@11
<en>Haruka came bolting towards me as I was walking down the corridor. She sounded like it was an emergency.
<es>

@15
<en>{Appo}\n"What kind of trouble is she in this time?"
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's find out."
<es>

@21
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ka-Kazushi-kun, Ka, hah, hahh, hahh..."
<es>

@22
<en>She gasped for breath as she leaned against a window. She's in a massive rush.
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Calm down. Take a deep breath."
<es>

@24
<en>{Haruka}\n"All right......"
<es>

@25
<en>{Kazushi}\n*inhale* *exhale*
<es>

@26
<en>I joined her in taking some deep breaths. I could tell that she was calming down.
<es>

@30
<en>{Pierre}\n"And what happened this time?"
<es>

@35
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ummm...have you seen me running around anywhere?"
<es>

@36
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um... Haruka? That's rather obvious..."
<es>

@40
<en>{Daigo}\n"Of course we have."
<es>

@41
<en>{Haruka}\n"Where!?"
<es>

@49
<en>{Boys}\n *STARE*
<es>

@50
<en>We all pointed at Haruka. She shook her head back and forth in a vigorous "no."
<es>

@56
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm not talking about me!!"
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You've just asked us if we've seen you."
<es>

@58
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm talking about another me! Have you seen her or not?"
<es>

@59
<en>Has she lost her mind?
<es>

@64
<en>{Appo}\n"Do you have a twin sister?"
<es>

@67
<en>{Haruka}\n"Do you think I do!?"
<es>

@70
<en>{Appo}\n"I don't think so...\nBut what do you mean another you?"
<es>

@71
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Anyways, we haven't seen you until just now."
<es>

@72
<en>This was getting complicated. Haruka let out a big sigh.
<es>

@75
<en>{Haruka}\n"I see. She must have gone somewhere else, then. Thanks, boys!"
<es>

@79
<en>Haruka took off somewhere like the wind.
<es>

@83
<en>{Daigo}\n"Maybe she's starting to lose it after years of living in this heat every day..."
<es>

@87
<en>{Pierre}\n"We should still stay good friends with her even if she does go completely off her rocker.\n...um...guys? What's that?"
<es>

@88
<en>Pierre looked down the corridor with an air of confusion. We could all tell why.
<es>

@96
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi-kun! Kazushi-kun!"
<es>

@97
<en>Haruka was running towards us again. And not from the same direction she just departed in.
<es>

@98
<en>In fact, Haruka was coming at us from the opposite direction.
<es>

@99
<en>We felt like we were watching a rewound video tape.
<es>

@106
<en>{Pierre}\n"Umm......"
<es>

@107
<en>{Daigo}\n"That's Haruka-chan, right?"
<es>

@108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think so."
<es>

@113
<en>This Haruka seemed to be in anything but a hurry.
<es>

@116
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hi, boys! Another hot day, isn't it?"
<es>

@117
<en>This one felt a lot more like the Haruka we knew.
<es>

@122
<en>{Pierre}\n"This one looks a lot more like the normal Haruka, don't you think, boys?"
<es>

@123
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I agree. Then that means the one we saw before was the fake Haruka?"
<es>

@126
<en>{Haruka}\n"What are you guys whispering to each other about?"
<es>

@130
<en>{Appo}\n"This may sound weird, but we just met up with you a minute ago."
<es>

@133
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh, you did? Which way did I go?"
<es>

@134
<en>She didn't look surprised at all.
<es>

@135
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That way. You seemed to be in a big hurry."
<es>

@136
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh, I see. Yeah, I'm supposed to be all scatterbrained, aren't I? Sometimes it's exhausting to act like that, though."
<es>

@137
<en>It sounded so normal that we nearly let it pass, but those words were anything but.
<es>

@141
<en>{Pierre}\n"Act like that? What are you talking about?"
<es>

@145
<en>{Daigo}\n"You are Haruka-chan, right?"
<es>

@146
<en>She sounded like an actress who was stepping into the role of Haruka.
<es>

@151
<en>{Haruka}\n"Well, the other one is also Haruka. I'm just her scapegoat."
<es>

@152
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Her scapegoat?"
<es>

@156
<en>{Daigo}\n"Hey, guys, remember when we had to supervise the principal's experiment? Haruka said she left a puppet in the classroom to fill in for her."
<es>

@161
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh yeah, I remember her saying that."
<es>

@168
<en>{Appo}\n"So are you the puppet she left behind?"
<es>

@174
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yes, I am."
<es>

@182
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, you nailed it, Daigo."
<es>

@185
<en>{Pierre}\n"But you don't look like a fake at all. How do we know that you're not the original Haruka?"
<es>

@189
<en>{Haruka Doll}\n"If you could tell us apart so easily, there wouldn't be any point to my existence."
<es>

@190
<en>{Daigo}\n"By the way, what are you doing here all by yourself?"
<es>

@191
<en>That's right. Haruka must be looking for her scapegoat.
<es>

@192
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Could this mean you ran away?"
<es>

@193
<en>It was just a random guess, but it seemed that I guessed right.
<es>

@196
<en>{Haruka Doll}\n"You don't believe what she's trying to do to me! She wants to dispose of me!"
<es>

@199
<en>{Haruka Doll}\n"She thinks I'm disposable! She's so evil! Don't let that devilishly cute face of hers fool you, boys. She's a jinxed cunt."
<es>

@200
<en>This doll was cutting Haruka to shreds with her words.
<es>

@206
<en>{Pierre}\n"A jinxed cunt... Really? Haruka-chan is... That's a shock."
<es>

@207
<en>{Appo}\n"She never looked like one to me. I guess appearances can be deceiving."
<es>

@210
<en>All of us were feeling disappointed. Only the doll was happy to see Haruka's reputation fall.
<es>

@211
<en>{Haruka Doll}\n"Anyways, can you guys hide me somewhere safe?"
<es>

@212
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know......."
<es>

@215
<en>{Appo}\n"Well, how about......"
<es>

@222
<en>We ended up taking her to our dorm.
<es>

@223
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are we going to do now?"
<es>

@225
<en>We heard the bell ring for the start of afternoon classes.
<es>

@229
<en>{Daigo}\n"Oh no, class is starting up again."
<es>

@230
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah, we've still got lessons to finish."
<es>

@236
<en>{Pierre}\n"Who cares, the last class before break is just winding things down. And if classes are going on, then no one will come here. It's perfect."
<es>

@237
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean 'it's perfect'?"
<es>

@241
<en>{Appo}\n"Boys, huddle up!"
<es>

@248
<en>On Appo and Pierre's signal, we all huddled our heads close together.
<es>

@249
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it? What are you planning?"
<es>

@252
<en>{Appo}\n"Think about it, you guys. That's a doll. A doll that's identical to the original Haruka."
<es>

@253
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Eh? So what?"
<es>

@254
<en>{Pierre}\n"D-does that mean that what's underneath her clothes must be identical too?"
<es>

@255
<en>Pierre's voice was shaking with excitement.\nNow I know exactly what they have in mind.
<es>

@256
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You guys aren't planning to..."
<es>

@259
<en>{Daigo}\n *GULP*
<es>

@260
<en>That was the loudest sound I have ever heard from someone swallowing his own spit.
<es>

@266
<en>{Haruka Doll}\n"What was that noise?"
<es>

@268
<en>She has no idea what we're talking about. She's as unguarded as a lamb surrounded by a pack of wolves.
<es>

@273
<en>{Pierre}\n"It's nothing! Just give us another minute!"
<es>

@274
<en>{Haruka Doll}\n"Huh? Sure..."
<es>

@282
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are we going to do?"
<es>

@285
<en>{Appo}\n"I say we just ask her to let us."
<es>

@286
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let us!? Listen to yourself - that's Haruka!"
<es>

@289
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's just a puppet. We can do this, can't we?"
<es>

@290
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know she's a puppet...\nBut, well, that's still Haruka on the surface."
<es>

@293
<en>{Appo}\n"That's what makes this so great. This is the perfect opportunity."
<es>

@294
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're right...But I don't know..."
<es>

@295
<en>{Daigo}\n"Why don't we start by asking her?"
<es>

@298
<en>{Appo}\n"Kazushi, will you ask her for us?"
<es>

@299
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No way! I can't ask her that! Why me?"
<es>

@302
<en>{Pierre}\n"Why don't we all ask together?"
<es>

@303
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Together? All of us?"
<es>

@304
<en>{Appo}\n"One, two..."
<es>

@310
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please let me have sex with you!!"
<es>

@312
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......what?"
<es>

@314
<en>I only heard my voice.
<es>

@322
<en>{Daigo}\n"He really did say it."
<es>

@323
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's my man."
<es>

@324
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You guys betrayed me!!"
<es>

@325
<en>I can't believe I just said that.\nI asked Haruka to have sex with me...
<es>

@331
<en>{Haruka Doll}\n"Sure."
<es>

@332
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@335
<en>{Haruka Doll}\n"You want to have sex with me, right Kazushi? I'll let you."
<es>

@338
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@339
<en>That was unexpectedly easy. Haruka's scapegoat doll turned out to be very open minded.
<es>

@347
<en>{Appo}\n"Wow, she's really going to let him have sex with her."
<es>

@348
<en>{Pierre}\n"You'll let me have sex with you too, right?"
<es>

@349
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Guys! You guys don't deserve......"
<es>

@355
<en>{Haruka Doll}\n"Sure."
<es>

@356
<en>...saywha!?
<es>

@357
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Loose! Too loose! You're being far too open-minded, Haruka!!"
<es>

@361
<en>{Pierre}\n"Remember, Kazushi, she's a puppet, not Haruka."
<es>

@362
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know......but......"
<es>

@363
<en>She looked identical to Haruka.\nI couldn't just treat her like a doll...
<es>

@368
<en>{Daigo}\n"This is great. We'll be cum brothers."
<es>

@369
<en>We looked at each other dumbfounded after Daigo's comment.
<es>

@370
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Brothers...sorta?"
<es>

@377
<en>{Appo}\n"I guess Daigo's right. In a sense, this is a pledge between brothers!"
<es>

@378
<en>{Pierre}\n"Appo's right! I didn't suggest this idea for any naughty reasons!"
<es>

@379
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't know that..."
<es>

@380
<en>This was a ritual for us to deepen our connection to each other. This had to be done for the sake of our brotherhood.
<es>

@381
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...wait a minute. Can I really trust you guys after all that?"
<es>

@384
<en>{Appo}\n"Don't think! Just feel!"
<es>

@387
<en>{Pierre}\n"Don't you want to do her?"
<es>

@388
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......I do."
<es>

@389
<en>Of course I want to do her.
<es>

@392
<en>{Appo}\n"Well then, let's do it! Let's be men!"
<es>

@393
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's be brothers!"
<es>

@394
<en>{Daigo}\n"Who's going first?"
<es>

@401
<en>{Boys}\n"Me!!!"
<es>

@408
<en>Everybody raised their hands at once. Everybody stared each other down.
<es>

@413
<en>{Pierre}\n"We all think the same. I say we go from the oldest to the youngest."
<es>

@414
<en>If we followed Pierre's suggestion, the order would be Pierre, Me, Daigo, and then Appo.
<es>

@415
<en>We're all in the same grade, of course, so the difference was just a few months on either end.
<es>

@419
<en>{Daigo}\n"Since you guys have already done this, you can go after me and Kazushi."
<es>

@420
<en>Daigo made an uncharacteristically bold statement. That showed just how much he wanted this.
<es>

@421
<en>{Kazushi}\n"He's right. You aren't a virgin, are you Pierre? And you're always doing Fuusen, so you don't matter, Appo."
<es>

@426
<en>{Pierre}\n"I haven't gotten lucky for a couple years..."
<es>

@433
<en>{Appo}\n"I've only done it with one person. Don't you think I should do it with someone else in order to realise how great my Fuusen is?"
<es>

@434
<en>{Appo}\n"I need to know someone else's touch to confirm my girlfriend's abilities."
<es>

@435
<en>{Daigo}\n"If that's the reason, you'll have no problem going after us, right?"
<es>

@438
<en>{Pierre}\n"Wait a minute, guys. I still think going by age is the best idea."
<es>

@441
<en>{Appo}\n"Shut up, you idiot! Go away, old man!"
<es>

@444
<en>{Daigo}\n"Let's go by class rank! I'm 35th!"
<es>

@447
<en>{Pierre}\n"Daigo! You know you're the only one exceeding the class average!"
<es>

@448
<en>{Appo}\n"Don't you look down on us just because you have good grades."
<es>

@452
<en>*SMACK*
<es>

@453
<en>Appo's short temper had run out, and he hit Daigo on the head.
<es>

@454
<en>{Daigo}\n"What did you do that for!?"
<es>

@457
<en>Bang!!
<es>

@458
<en>{Appo}\n"Ugggah!"
<es>

@462
<en>And of course, he got hit back and their little squabble started.
<es>

@468
<en>{Pierre}\n"Screw it, I'm first!"
<es>

@475
<en>{Daigo}\n"Rooooooar!"
<es>

@480
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm...guys? Are we really going to have to decide this with violence? I thought we were supposed to be engaged in a brotherhood of men..."
<es>

@481
<en>I think the only thing getting deeper is our ditch, not our bonds. They're beating each other up.
<es>

@486
<en>{Appo}\n"Me! Me!"
<es>

@493
<en>{Daigo}\n"You stay out of this, Appo. I don't want to have to hurt you."
<es>

@498
<en>{Haruka Doll}\n"Wow, this is awesome! Everybody's fighting over me!"
<es>

@501
<en>*Slide*
<es>

@502
<en>That's when the window was opened.
<es>

@507
<en>{Haruka}\n"What are you guys making so much noise for...Ah!!"
<es>

@508
<en>It was Haruka - the real Haruka. She leapt into the room as she spotted her puppet.
<es>

@513
<en>{Haruka}\n"Gotcha!"
<es>

@515
<en>Haruka captured the scapegoat puppet.
<es>

@519
<en>{Haruka Doll}\n"Oh no. She got me."
<es>

@520
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@525
<en>{Pierre}\n"Shit..."
<es>

@526
<en>Everything stopped. Well, that chapter's over. What were we doing?
<es>

@532
<en>{Haruka}\n"You guys found her for me. Thanks for keep your eyes on her!"
<es>

@533
<en>Thank goodness for small miracles - Haruka didn't catch what we were up to.
<es>

@534
<en>{Pierre}\n"Ahaha, yeah, we were."
<es>

@541
<en>{Daigo}\n"I'm glad we found her for you............"
<es>

@544
<en>{Haruka}\n"Why are you guys so disappointed?"
<es>

@545
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's nothing. No big deal......"
<es>

@549
<en>*poke poke*
<es>

@552
<en>{Appo}\n"Hey, Kazushi."
<es>

@553
<en>Appo whispered to me.
<es>

@554
<en>{Appo}\n"Can you try asking her one more time?"
<es>

@555
<en>Appo was having a hard time giving up the opportunity we had in front of us.
<es>

@556
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you stupid? That's the real Haruka."
<es>

@559
<en>{Appo}\n"How about asking her for it in return for capturing the doll?"
<es>

@564
<en>{Pierre}\n"You're such a brute, Appo."
<es>

@567
<en>{Appo}\n"That's what we need to be. We need to be more forceful in order to get what we want."
<es>

@571
<en>{Daigo}\n"I kind of understand what he's saying. We are being too elegant."
<es>

@572
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We are? We need to act more barbarously?"
<es>

@575
<en>{Appo}\n"Hey guys......"
<es>

@580
<en>{Haruka}\n"Why are you guys whispering to each other?"
<es>

@588
<en>We made up our mind. Our heart is bonded as one.
<es>

@589
<en>{Pierre}\n"This time we'll say it together."
<es>

@590
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't you guys go betraying me again, got it?"
<es>

@593
<en>{Appo}\n"All right......one, two!"
<es>

@604
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Like hell I'm saying it!"
<es>

@605
