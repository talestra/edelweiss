<en>Hey, are you sure?\nBut Ran's in trouble. I can't just leave her be.
<es>

@9
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can you give me some time to get it together?"
<es>

@10
<en>Maybe I can come up with a way to get it, given time.
<es>

@13
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh? You'll lend it to me? But it's 100,000 yen? How are you going to get it?"
<es>

@14
<en>She thinks I can't help her, even though she's the one who asked me for it in the first place.
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, you need it, right?\nI'll try somehow."
<es>

@18
<en>{Ran}\n"But how......?"
<es>

@19
<en>She's right. I've got no idea how I can do it. What can I do to make 100,000 yen? Well, I'll try to do what I can.
<es>

@20
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Give me a few days, OK?"
<es>

@21
<en>{Ran}\n"Sure......"
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Trust me. I'll get it."
<es>

@23
<en>{Ran}\n"All right......"
<es>

@24
<en>Are there any part-time jobs around that could pay that much in a few days? Maybe I could borrow it from somebody...\nI have to find a way...
<es>

@29
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, you guys heard me."
<es>

@30
<en>I started out by asking my buds for help.
<es>

@33
<en>{Appo}\n"Can it GET any hotter in here? I wanna fuck."
<es>

@34
<en>I don't think they're listening to me...
<es>

@39
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, Appo, it's not like you're any better than us now just because you've got a girlfriend..."
<es>

@46
<en>{Daigo}\n"It's only Fuusen, anyways..."
<es>

@49
<en>{Appo}\n"What's that supposed to mean!? \nHey, Kazushi, you can see how sexy she is, right?"
<es>

@50
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry, Appo, I really can't.\nAnyways, were you guys listening to my story?"
<es>

@53
<en>{Daigo}\n"Eh? How long have you been here, Kazushi?"
<es>

@56
<en>{Pierre}\n"Kazushi, you suck at asserting yourself. You have to appeal yourself more."
<es>

@57
<en>They didn't even realize I was here. Maybe I need to be more insistent instead.
<es>

@58
<en>Here it goes.
<es>

@59
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shut up and lend me 100,000 yen."
<es>

@64
<en>{Appo}\n"Fuck off!"
<es>

@65
<en>Fail.
<es>

@68
<en>{Appo}\n"Where was I?\nOh yeah, did you guys know Fuusen loves to cook and......"
<es>

@73
<en>{Pierre}\n"Enough already! If you want her so badly, just go and see her! She's not far away."
<es>

@74
<en>{Appo}\n"Heh, heh, heh. That's a good idea. Maybe I will. What do you guys think?"
<es>

@75
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I couldn't care less. But if you give me 100,000 yen I'll give my professional opinion."
<es>

@80
<en>{Daigo}\n"Oh yeah, what do you need the 100,000 yen for?"
<es>

@81
<en>They finally started listening to me...
<es>

@82
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's Ran......"
<es>

@84
<en>I stopped there. She might have a reason why she doesn't want anybody else to know.
<es>

@85
<en>And then she snuck up on me quietly.
<es>

@88
<en>{Fuusen}\n"What's this about Ran?"
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fuusen!? How long have you been here??"
<es>

@90
<en>She was in our room before we knew it.
<es>

@95
<en>{Appo}\n"Fuuuuuuuuuu-chan!!!!\nWhy are you here?"
<es>

@98
<en>{Fuusen}\n"I received your 'wanna see you' signals. I can feel whatever you're thinking about me."
<es>

@101
<en>{Appo}\n"This is a miracle of love!"
<es>

@106
<en>{Pierre}\n"Whatever."
<es>

@107
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Guys, please. I'm in a hurry."
<es>

@111
<en>I needed to come up with some way to gather 100,000 yen in just a few days. Fuusen gave me a serious look.
<es>

@112
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You need a hundred grand? That's not an IMPOSSIBLE amount to raise."
<es>

@113
<en>For some reason, she looked forceful.
<es>

@114
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's that look for?"
<es>

@115
<en>{Fuusen}\n"...are you going to use that money for something evil?"
<es>

@116
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean?"
<es>

@121
<en>{Pierre}\n"She's right. Needing that much this quick is suspicious."
<es>

@122
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Why do you need to get 100,000 yen together for Ran? That sounds so suspicious."
<es>

@123
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't have any reason to feel guilty about it."
<es>

@124
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Then why do you need so much money?"
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I need it for a good cause."
<es>

@126
<en>...I didn't know why she needed it either. I didn't ask, and I didn't know what to tell these people.
<es>

@127
<en>I really should have found out what the reason was. Am I honestly that stupid?
<es>

@131
<en>{Daigo}\n"We can't understand your problem. I don't think anyone's going to help you out if you can't share your reason with us."
<es>

@134
<en>{Pierre}\n"100,000 yen isn't exactly spare change. I don't think any of the boys have that kind of cash on hand."
<es>

@138
<en>{Fuusen}\n"I don't think any of the girls would either. As you guys know, it's not like this island is a shopper's paradise."
<es>

@139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're right. Maybe I should give up......"
<es>

@140
<en>Well, I didn't expect too much from these guys anyways, but I still didn't know who else I couldn't turn to for help.
<es>

@141
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Some of the teachers might have that much. Only other option is to work and earn it, or try and pawn something off for it..."
<es>

@142
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's see......"
<es>

@143
<en>I didn't bring any more than the bare essentials with me to the island. I don't think I can find a part time job here, either.
<es>

@147
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Hey...are you sure you're not using the money for something bad? Don't tell me you're going to use it to buy her...?"
<es>

@148
<en>She said something serious before pretending like it didn't happen.
<es>

@149
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What did you say?"
<es>

@152
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Nothing."
<es>

@153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Could you repeat that? It's bothering me."
<es>

@158
<en>{Appo}\n"That's enough. Can you clean out my ear wax, Fuu-chan?"
<es>

@161
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You are such a big baby."
<es>

@166
<en>{Pierre}\n"Go do that somewhere else. It's already hot enough in here."
<es>

@167
<en>Well, now what? Where and how am I going to get 100,000 yen?
<es>
