@7
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you guys wanna do today?"
<es>

@8
<en>We were trying to figure out what to do as we ate breakfast. This was the best part of summer break: having the entire day wide open to do whatever we want.
<es>

@11
<en>{Pierre}\n"Let's go out and have fun with the girls again. I'll definitely make a move this time."
<es>

@16
<en>{Daigo}\n"I want to go collect some bugs. I need to send my relative some stag beetles."
<es>

@23
<en>{Appo}\n"I'm going fishing with Fuu-chan today. She's never been before."
<es>

@24
<en>{Appo}\n"She said she can't touch the bugs used for bait, so I have to put them on for her. Girls are so cute."
<es>

@25
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fishing sounds fun.\nShould we go, too?"
<es>

@26
<en>When I thought about it, it would've been a waste not to go fishing, given that we were on an island. I still remembered the mountain of tuna we saw on our arrival.
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Isn't this island an ideal place to fish, too?\nRemember those huge tuna? Let's go catch something fresh for dinner."
<es>

@28
<en>It was our turn to cook, so we're in charge of tonight's dinner.\nI wanted to surprise everybody.
<es>

@29
<en>{Daigo}\n"If we cooked up fish we caught ourselves, wouldn't that reel in the points?"
<es>

@30
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Exactly! Let's fish up a big one and slice and dice it in front of everyone!"
<es>

@33
<en>{Appo}\n"A dissection show, huh? I heard on TV that some sushi restaurants actually do that."
<es>

@36
<en>{Daigo}\n"Sushi...yeah. It's not very hard to make sushi rolls."
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"And if we set it up so everyone rolls their own, it's easier for us. Alright! Tonight it's make-it-yourself sushi! Let's go hook those fish!"
<es>

@40
<en>{Pierre}\n"Why don't we ask some of the girls to come with us! If Fuu-chan's never been fishing, I bet there's others who haven't as well."
<es>

@43
<en>{Appo}\n"Fuusen was telling me how girls find men who are in tune with nature and boast survival skills very attractive."
<es>

@44
<en>{Pierre}\n"The outdoor boom isn't over yet! And if we teach those girls who know nothing, we'll score even more points!"
<es>

@45
<en>{Daigo}\n"Guys, forget what I said earlier about hunting for beetles."
<es>

@46
<en>{Appo}\n"We can rent whatever we need from the fishermen by the beach."
<es>

@47
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let me take care of renting the gear.\nPierre, why don't you go ask the girls?"
<es>

@48
<en>{Pierre}\n"Okay! I'll round 'em up!"
<es>

@49
<en>Our minds were already filled with thoughts of clear blue ocean waves and pretty girls.
<es>

@54
<en>When I got back from the gear rental, the girls were already waiting.
<es>

@57
<en>{Mizuki}\n"We don't have any supplies, though."
<es>

@58
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Here you go. I just got back from the rental shop."
<es>

@64
<en>{Andou}\n"Wow, you guys are well prepared."
<es>

@65
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Good job, boys."
<es>

@66
<en>Fuusen and Andou seemed to be looking forward to this.\nAlso...
<es>

@71
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, hey, how much do you think the fish will go for? Where can we get the expensive ones?"
<es>

@72
<en>There was one girl with a yen for a yen.
<es>

@73
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can't you be a bit more romantic about this? We're not fishermen; we're going to eat everything we catch today."
<es>

@76
<en>{Ran}\n"What are you talking about? How are we going to make any money if we do that?"
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We're not going fishing today just to make money. If you trawl the line with thoughts like that, you won't get any."
<es>

@80
<en>{Ran}\n"Cut the chat, just guide me to where we can fish for expensive ones."
<es>

@81
<en>She fully intends on fishing up a big one and selling it off for big profit. Well, as long as she has fun...
<es>

@82
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I talked to the local fishermen and got the right bait. I even had them tell me some good spots. The only the thing we'll need is patience."
<es>

@85
<en>{Ran}\n"Patience?"
<es>

@86
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Even if you're not catching any, you can't carry on or the fish will run away more. You'll have to quietly leave the line out."
<es>

@87
<en>I'd never actually seen Ran be anything even remotely resembling patient. Maybe she wouldn't enjoy fishing very much after all...
<es>

@90
<en>{Ran}\n"Believe it or not, I'm confident in my concentration. I'll pull in everything out there, even the ocean depths."
<es>

@91
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not sure if you can call that fishing..."
<es>

@92
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm gonna surprise the hell out of all those fishermen! I'll catch so much that the market price will double by the end of the day."
<es>

@96
<en>Our fishing spot was at the rocks by the cliff. It seems it's best to fish there at full tide, but we could still fish a decent amount at low tide.
<es>

@97
<en>We set up the rods for the girls and help them cast their lines.
<es>

@100
<en>{Andou}\n"Hey, do something about this!"
<es>

@101
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?\nHave you caught something already?"
<es>

@102
<en>{Andou}\n"The fish hook caught on my skirt. Take it out, take it out!"
<es>

@103
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that's too bad. I thought you might have already got a fish on your line."
<es>

@104
<en>It had only been five minutes. It was way too soon for anybody to get lucky.
<es>

@105
<en>{Andou}\n"Can someone help me out?\nACK! My skirt!"
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Just stay calm. Nobody wants to see that!"
<es>

@107
<en>I could see her wearing black ones today. It reminded me of the pair I accidentally put on my head when we first arrived on the island.
<es>

@110
<en>{Andou}\n"Hey!\nDon't go looking up my skirt!"
<es>

@111
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I swear on my life that I will never look up your skirt."
<es>

@112
<en>{Andou}\n"That sounds rude."
<es>

@116
<en>{Ran}\n"You're being way too loose, Kazushi. I know you're young and it's gonna happen, but at least pick a decent girl."
<es>

@117
<en>She was whispering, but that was too rude.
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If she heard that, you'd be in Davy Jones' locker."
<es>

@121
<en>{Ran}\n"By the way, if you want to see some underwear, how about mine?"
<es>

@122
<en>She gave me a friendly wink, but I knew what she wanted.
<es>

@123
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But you're charging, right? No deal."
<es>

@126
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahaha, you knew."
<es>

@127
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Look, you're a young girl. You shouldn't be trying to make money off that."
<es>

@132
<en>{Pierre}\n"Kazushi, you're so stiff. How about I take that deal?"
<es>

@133
<en>He may sound like he's joking, but he's being serious.
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I thought you weren't interested in panties."
<es>

@137
<en>{Pierre}\n"There's a difference between panties and panties when they're still on the girl."
<es>

@138
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@139
<en>That makes sense.\nHe's a genius.
<es>

@142
<en>{Pierre}\n"So, how much are you going to charge me?"
<es>

@143
<en>He sounded happier than ever.
<es>

@146
<en>{Ran}\n"Sorry, deal's closed."
<es>

@147
<en>Ran quickly withdrew the offer. Pierre was seriously disappointed.
<es>

@150
<en>{Pierre}\n"Why? I promise I'll pay."
<es>

@151
<en>{Ran}\n"That offer was only for Kazushi."
<es>

@154
<en>{Pierre}\n"Whaddaya mean?\nYou aren't offering that to anybody besides Kazushi?"
<es>

@155
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Just for me?"
<es>

@158
<en>{Ran}\n"Umm......"
<es>

@159
<en>The person who was shocked the most by that statement was actually Ran herself. I tilted my head in confusion and looked at Pierre.
<es>

@162
<en>{Ran}\n"I didn't mean that Kazushi is more special than anybody else."
<es>

@163
<en>{Pierre}\n"But that's how it is? You'll show him, but no one else?"
<es>

@164
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't know why either.\nI just feel so comfortable with him."
<es>

@165
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean?\nAre you saying I'm one of the girls?"
<es>

@168
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahaha, nice one! I bet you'd look good in drag!"
<es>

@169
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's not what I was asking."
<es>

@172
<en>{Pierre}\n"I think she's changing the subject."
<es>

@174
<en>Pierre shrugged his shoulders and stepped away. He looked even more disappointed.
<es>

@177
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Look what you did to Pierre. Don't offer something if you can't make good on it."
<es>

@180
<en>{Ran}\n"But I couldn't actually show him. Kazushi, would it be all right with you if I showed other guys my panties?"
<es>

@181
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why are you asking me that?"
<es>

@182
<en>I tried to imagine her showing her underwear to Pierre.
<es>

@183
<en>Ran lifting her skirt up as Pierre watched with a really happy grin, leaning in so close his nose nearly touched.
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......"
<es>

@187
<en>{Ran}\n"What do you think?"
<es>

@188
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......I don't like it."
<es>

@189
<en>{Ran}\n"What exactly do you mean by "you don't like it"?"
<es>

@190
<en>It was hard for me to answer. I didn't know.
<es>

@191
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know why, but I don't want you doing that. You shouldn't go trying to make money that way."
<es>

@192
<en>{Ran}\n"That's why I'm not doing it!"
<es>

@193
<en>I didn't even know why we were arguing.
<es>

@197
<en>{Mizuki}\n"OMIGODYOUGUYS!"
<es>

@198
<en>All of a sudden, Mizuki screamed.
<es>

@205
<en>{Mizuki}\n"K-Kazushi! Kazushi! Wh-why is this rod moving?"
<es>

@206
<en>Mizuki's rod was bending like a large bow. She was trying to use all her weight to stabilise her fishing pole.
<es>

@207
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You've caught a big one!"
<es>

@212
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yes! It must be a big one."
<es>

@213
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? What? You mean I hooked one? Wh-what do I do?"
<es>

@214
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Just hang in there!"
<es>

@217
<en>I ran over and grabbed onto her rod from behind.
<es>

@220
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you doing!?"
<es>

@221
<en>Mizuki voice cracked. Probably because I had my arms around her from behind.
<es>

@222
<en>I have to press her body into mine just so that we could keep the fish on the line.
<es>

@223
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Just deal with it for a second!"
<es>

@226
<en>{Mizuki}\n"All right!"
<es>

@227
<en>I tried reeling in her fishing pole and it went crazy.
<es>

@235
<en>{Daigo}\n"It's really big. Be careful that the line doesn't break."
<es>

@236
<en>{Andou}\n"Go, Mizuki-chan!!"
<es>

@237
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Go Mizuki-chan! Go Haruma-kun!"
<es>

@243
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm doing my best!\nWhy does it have to be me!?"
<es>

@244
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It means the ocean loves you, Mizuki!"
<es>

@247
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You think so?"
<es>

@252
<en>{Ran}\n"Stop acting cool, Kazushi."
<es>

@253
<en>I didn't have time to reply to Ran's complaints.
<es>

@258
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hang in there, you two!"
<es>

@262
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hey, Kazushi-kun."
<es>

@263
<en>Haruka was all excited.
<es>

@264
<en>{Haruka}\n"Should I start getting that ready?"
<es>

@265
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@268
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm talking about ink, of course. Do you want some?"
<es>

@269
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ink? Why would I need that?"
<es>

@272
<en>{Haruka}\n"Don't fishermen keep records of the fish they've caught by using ink to show how big they are on paper?"
<es>

@273
<en>I think she's talking about fishing prints. I'm surprised that she knows about those.
<es>

@274
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right.\nHaruka, I'll leave the ink to you. It's an important job, so be careful."
<es>

@277
<en>{Haruka}\n"Got it! I'm a third-degree in calligraphy."
<es>

@278
<en>To be honest, I only asked her in order to keep her busy and away from where she might bother me.
<es>

@282
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's pulling me so hard!"
<es>

@283
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shit! It's a strong one!"
<es>

@284
<en>I felt like I was trying to pull up the entire Earth itself.
<es>

@290
<en>{Appo}\n"What if after all this excitement it's just a log?"
<es>

@291
<en>{Daigo}\n"It can't be. It's moving."
<es>

@296
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't keep going anymore!"
<es>

@297
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Just a little longer!\nHe's getting tired, too!"
<es>

@298
<en>It was just as strong as ever, but it was moving more slowly.
<es>

@299
<en>It had been whipping about trying to shake us off, but now it was calming down.
<es>

@303
<en>{Daigo}\n"Here it comes!"
<es>

@304
<en>All of a sudden, the fishing pole felt lighter. We pulled the line into the air.
<es>

@308
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wow......!?"
<es>

@314
<en>The ocean surface swelled up, and then out jumped a giant fish.
<es>

@321
<en>{Appo}\n"So huge!"
<es>

@322
<en>{Pierre}\n"Unreal......"
<es>

@323
<en>We couldn't believe what we saw.\nIt was so huge......
<es>

@330
<en>{Ran}\n"Wh-what was that? Was that a fish?"
<es>

@331
<en>{Fuusen}\n"It's a miracle that the fishing pole hasn't broken!"
<es>

@335
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hold on! Let me make your fishing pole and line stronger!"
<es>

@343
<en>Haruka poured some kind of solution on the pole and it shone for a moment.
<es>

@344
<en>{Haruka}\n"It should be stronger now!"
<es>

@348
<en>{Andou}\n"Then we can pull as hard as we want, right? Everyone, let's pull it together!"
<es>

@356
<en>Andou and Daigo joined us in our efforts to reel in the fish.
<es>

@357
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OH YEAH!"
<es>

@358
<en>The fishing line was sounded like it was being stretched to its limits. It could snap at any second.
<es>

@364
<en>{Haruka}\n"Don't worry guys, it's not going to snap!"
<es>

@372
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hoooooooooh!"
<es>

@373
<en>{Daigo}\n"Hoooooooooooh!"
<es>

@374
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Here it is!!"
<es>

@375
<en>The monster showed its huge body above the surface once again.
<es>

@384
<en>{Appo}\n"It's out!"
<es>

@385
<en>The huge creature flew high up into the air and started falling. Andou dashed into the shallows to catch it.
<es>

@389
<en>{Andou}\n"Bring it!"
<es>

@391
<en>Andou caught the beast in her massive arms.
<es>

@395
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yes!"
<es>

@396
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We did it!!"
<es>

@400
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I did it? I did it? Yes!!"
<es>

@401
<en>Mizuki got so excited, she couldn't help hugging me.
<es>

@402
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't believe I caught such a huge fish!!"
<es>

@403
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki, I know you're happy, but I can't breathe..."
<es>

@404
<en>And I could feel her soft and squishy bits...
<es>

@411
<en>{Ran}\n *AHEM*
<es>

@412
<en>Ran gave an obvious cough and stared at me.
<es>

@416
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oops."
<es>

@418
<en>Mizuki hid herself behind me to avoid Ran's wrath.
<es>

@421
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why are you staring at me like that?"
<es>

@422
<en>{Ran}\n"Is this what you were talking about when you said I'd need to be patient today?"
<es>

@423
<en>Ran mumbled her disapproval.
<es>

@424
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean?"
<es>

@427
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm saying that I don't get why I have to put up with watching you like that."
<es>

@428
<en>Ran huffed and swung her rod. I don't know why she's upset.
<es>

@431
<en>{Ran}\n"Why am I so upset?\nI can't control my feelings......"
<es>

@432
<en>Ran steadied herself and stared at me again.
<es>

@433
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@436
<en>{Ran}\n"Umm......?"
<es>

@437
<en>She continued to stare at me and tilted her head.
<es>

@438
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you all right?"
<es>

@439
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm kinda feeling woozy..."
<es>

@440
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're feeling dizzy? You're not getting heatstroke, are you?"
<es>

@441
<en>I put my hand on her forehead. It felt a bit too hot for normal.
<es>

@444
<en>{Ran}\n"I'll be fine.\nI don't get sick very often."
<es>

@445
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Even the healthiest person can get sunstroke. You should rest up somewhere cool before it gets worse."
<es>

@446
<en>I grabbed her hand and dragged her somewhere shady.
<es>

@449
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah!"
<es>

@450
<en>She was unexpectedly obedient.\nI made her sit down and rest under the shade, handing her a water bottle.
<es>

@454
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Here, drink some water. Pushing yourself when you think you're okay is your greatest risk."
<es>

@455
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm sure I'll be fine."
<es>

@456
<en>She was still mumbling, but the fact that was so obedient was unusual.
<es>

@457
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let me sit down here, too."
<es>

@458
<en>I didn't want to leave her alone.
<es>

@459
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't you wanna go back to where everyone else is?"
<es>

@460
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll stay here and make sure you don't fall into the water."
<es>

@461
<en>{Ran}\n"How would I do that?\nYou're so overprotective."
<es>

@462
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Actually, I wouldn't be able to help you if you did fall in the ocean because I sink like a rock."
<es>

@463
<en>{Ran}\n"Are you serious?\nShame on you."
<es>

@464
<en>She was laughing hard. She must have been feeling a bit better now.
<es>

@465
<en>{Ran}\n"That's hilarious. You can't even swim, but you transferred to a school where there's nothing to do but go to the beach!"
<es>

@466
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, there's lots of other things to do here. Think about it, I transferred to a co-ed school for a reason."
<es>

@467
<en>{Ran}\n"You're that happy about transferring to a co-ed school?"
<es>

@468
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If there's an all girls' boarding school, a man has to go. Summer, the beach, and an academy full of women... It'd be stranger if nothing happened."
<es>

@469
<en>{Ran}\n"Any progress so far?"
<es>

@470
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......"
<es>

@471
<en>I didn't know how to answer that question. Sure, a lot of things may have happened in the last month, but I don't know if I could call any of that progress.
<es>

@472
<en>What does that mean by "progress", anyways?
<es>

@473
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, have you found anybody you like?"
<es>

@474
<en>Ran may have asked me the question, but now she was looking away.
<es>

@475
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm, let's see......"
<es>

@476
<en>There've been so many things happening in just one month that I guess I was too busy to think about finding "the one" girl for me.
<es>

@477
<en>By the way, it feels weird talking about this with Ran.
<es>

@478
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't remember having this kind of conversation with you before."
<es>

@479
<en>{Ran}\n"Haven't we?"
<es>

@480
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, we haven't. You always talk about money."
<es>

@481
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahaha, maybe you're right. Kazushi, do you hate girls like that?"
<es>

@482
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What kind of question is that?"
<es>

@483
<en>{Ran}\n"Why? Is it funny?"
<es>

@484
<en>It is funny. She's being very careful about what words she uses to phrase her questions today.
<es>

@485
<en>She's usually blunt and inconsiderate and not very good at being delicate with her choice of expression.
<es>

@486
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't dislike girls like you.\nIf I did, I wouldn't be your friend."
<es>

@487
<en>{Ran}\n"Are we friends?"
<es>

@488
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why not? I think we're friends."
<es>

@489
<en>{Ran}\n"...am I a more special friend than Haruka or Mizuki?"
<es>

@490
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...huh?"
<es>

@491
<en>Why is she asking me this?\nShe's being weird today...
<es>

@492
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Ran, are you OK?"
<es>

@493
<en>Speaking of which, she looked like she was thinking about something. She tilted her head after mumbling.
<es>

@494
<en>{Ran}\n"I feel weird here."
<es>

@495
<en>She pointed at her heart.
<es>

@496
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're having a heart attack?"
<es>

@497
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't think I'm that old yet.\nI don't know why I feel weird."
<es>

@498
<en>She scratched her chest. I started to feel kind of weird watching her.
<es>

@499
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm..."
<es>

@500
<en>{Ran}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@501
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm starting to feel weird in the same place."
<es>

@502
<en>{Ran}\n"You know what I mean?\nWhat's wrong with us?"
<es>

@503
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know......"
<es>

@504
<en>I've never felt like this before.
<es>

@509
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Eat! Everyone, eat!!"
<es>

@510
<en>Everybody liked my idea of making their own sushi rolls. They all chatted as they rolled up the ones they wanted.
<es>

@513
<en>{Mei}\n"This is a great idea."
<es>

@514
<en>Mei-sensei seemed impressed.
<es>

@515
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We've got rice, sliced fish, and seaweed. This is fun and convenient, right?"
<es>

@516
<en>Pierre and Daigo were busy running around demonstrating and helping out the girls who didn't know how to roll sushi.
<es>

@517
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm surprised there are so many girls here who can't make their own sushi rolls."
<es>

@518
<en>They must be from rich families who either go to sushi restaurants or buy it from the grocery but never make it themselves.
<es>

@519
<en>{Mei}\n"Actually, this is my first time making sushi."
<es>

@520
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? Are you from a rich family?"
<es>

@523
<en>{Mei}\n"I thought sushi was supposed to go around and come to you..."
<es>

@524
<en>Nope, middle class.
<es>

@525
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm glad you're here with me."
<es>

@526
<en>I felt close to her. Mei-sensei was a beauty, but she wasn't hard to approach either. She felt like the girl-next-door.
<es>

@527
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, then have you not had one yet?"
<es>

@530
<en>{Mei}\n"No, I went around observing everyone, so I was just planning to make one."
<es>

@531
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Come on, I'll help."
<es>

@534
<en>{Mei}\n"You will?\nThanks!"
<es>

@535
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then tell me which fish you want."
<es>

@536
<en>{Mei}\n"Let's see......"
<es>

@537
<en>She pointed at every fish on the table.\nI forgot her massive appetite.
<es>

@538
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You've got yourself a huge roll."
<es>

@541
<en>{Mei}\n"It looks delicious.\nCan I start?"
<es>

@542
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Go right ahead."
<es>

@545
<en>{Mei}\n"Thank you."
<es>

@546
<en>She got her teeth into the special roll.
<es>

@547
<en>{Mei}\n"This is so delicious! I can tell how fresh the fish is!"
<es>

@548
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We just caught the tuna today."
<es>

@552
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hey, is it true that you just caught it today?!"
<es>

@553
<en>I could see Sakura and Mizuki enjoying their sushi from the other side of the cafeteria.
<es>

@558
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm telling you the truth! I caught a bunch of it this afternoon!"
<es>

@562
<en>{Rin}\n"There's no way a beginner could reel in such a big tuna?"
<es>

@563
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm not lying!\nKazushi! Tell her I'm not lying!!"
<es>

@564
<en>Mizuki shouted at me for help.
<es>

@565
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's right. She caught a huge fish on her first cast."
<es>

@569
<en>{Sakura}\n"She really did!? I can't believe it! You sure are a girl of the sea."
<es>

@572
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well, Kazushi helped me out of course."
<es>

@573
<en>{Sakura}\n"You guys caught it together? A collaboration?"
<es>

@576
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, it's not like we're getting married."
<es>

@577
<en>{Sakura}\n"Ahaha, you're blushing! You're such a shy girl!"
<es>

@581
<en>{Rin}\n"That's why Sakura teases you all the time."
<es>

@582
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't help it......"
<es>

@586
<en>{Sakura}\n"Come over here, Harucchi. Let me take a picture of you and Mizuki!"
<es>

@587
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Why are you doing this?\nI'm too shy for that."
<es>

@588
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? A picture?"
<es>

@592
<en>{Sakura}\n"Just get over here."
<es>

@593
<en>Sakura pulled my arm.
<es>

@597
<en>{Ran}\n"Wait a minute."
<es>

@598
<en>Ran got in between us in order to pull me away.
<es>

@599
<en>{Ran}\n".................."
<es>

@600
<en>Her eyes were scary. She seemed upset.
<es>

@603
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, Kazushi......"
<es>

@604
<en>All of a sudden, she broke out in a smile.
<es>

@605
<en>{Ran}\n"Will you make me a sushi roll, too?"
<es>

@606
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A sushi roll? Sure..."
<es>

@607
<en>But she already had some sushi in her hand.
<es>

@608
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You've already got one. Why do you need my help?"
<es>

@616
<en>{Sakura}\n"He's busy! We're just about to take a picture..."
<es>

@619
<en>{Mizuki}\n"...ack!"
<es>

@625
<en>{Rin}\n"Ah, Mizuki-chan ran off!"
<es>

@628
<en>{Sakura}\n"Ah, hold on! After her!"
<es>

@633
<en>Sakura and Fujisaki-san went after Mizuki.
<es>

@636
<en>{Ran}\n"Make me a sushi roll, Kazushi."
<es>

@637
<en>Ran was being unusually persistent.
<es>

@638
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fine, but why me?"
<es>

@641
<en>{Ran}\n"......it's tiring."
<es>

@642
<en>She was being selfish.\nWhat's wrong with her?
<es>

@643
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Making your own roll is the fun part, you know?"
<es>

@648
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes. Haruma-kun's right. Handmade sushi is meant to be enjoyed in the making, not just eating."
<es>

@649
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's fun.\nTry......"
<es>

@650
<en>{Ran}\n"Just make me one.\nYou made one for her."
<es>

@651
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's the matter with you?\nFine, I guess I can make you one, but tell me what you want."
<es>

@654
<en>{Ran}\n"Let's see...\nThis! And this!"
<es>

@655
<en>And suddenly she became all cheerful.
<es>

@658
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh my."
<es>

@659
<en>Mei-sensei shrugged her shoulders in jest as she watched us.
<es>

@660
<en>There was a protective smile on her lips.
<es>

@661
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it, Mei-sensei?"
<es>

@662
<en>{Mei}\n"Nothing. I just never knew you two are so close. I've never seen Kamoike-san act so spoiled in front of someone before."
<es>

@665
<en>{Ran}\n"...I'm not fawning over Kazushi."
<es>

@666
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes you are. You're making me prepare a sushi roll for you."
<es>

@669
<en>{Ran}\n"???\nDo you really call that fawning over someone?"
<es>

@670
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, I do."
<es>

@673
<en>{Mei}\n"I would."
<es>

@674
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmm..."
<es>

@675
<en>She didn't realize it herself?\nRan's been acting weird around me lately. I wonder what's gotten into her.
<es>

@679
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, Kazushi......"
<es>

@680
<en>Ran tugged on my shirt sleeve.
<es>

@681
<en>{Ran}\n"Follow me outside for a sec."
<es>

@682
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@685
<en>{Ran}\n"......I need to ask you something. Can you come with me for just a sec?"
<es>

@686
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you need?"
<es>

@687
<en>I wonder what it is. Ran's never asked me for help before.
<es>

@692
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What did you need to tell me?"
<es>

@695
<en>{Ran}\n"Umm......"
<es>

@696
<en>She's looking down. It must be something difficult to say.
<es>

@697
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is it something difficult to discuss?"
<es>

@698
<en>{Ran}\n"Well......"
<es>

@699
<en>She rocked her body uncomfortably, twirled her fingers, stuttered as she tried to say it, and then finally let it out.
<es>

@702
<en>{Ran}\n"Please lend me some money!!"
<es>

@703
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Money?\nHow much do you need?"
<es>

@704
<en>Of course, I don't actually have any money. And when I say that, I don't mean "oh I don't have any money with me at school." I mean "I literally have no money."
<es>

@707
<en>{Ran}\n"Well...... How much money do you have?"
<es>

@708
<en>She asked me back.\nI didn't know.
<es>

@709
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean "how much do I have"?\nYou're the who's asking a favor."
<es>

@710
<en>{Ran}\n"I see.\nMaybe...1,000,000 yen?"
<es>

@711
<en>{Kazushi}\n"1,000,000 yen!? No way!"
<es>

@712
<en>Of course I didn't have it.\nWhat kind of student has that kind of money?
<es>

@713
<en>{Ran}\n"No?\nWhat about 100,000 yen?"
<es>

@714
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think I might have 100,000 yen..."
<es>

@715
<en>No, I don't have 100,000. What should I do?
<es>

@716
<en>What should I do...
<es>
