@461
<en>{Ran}\n"How would I do that?\nYou are nutural worrier."
<es>

@462
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Actually, I won't be able to help you if you really fell into the ocean,\nbecause I can't swim."

@463
<en>{Ran}\n"Are you serious?\nShame on you."
<es>

@464
<en>She is laughing hard.\nShe must be felling little better now.
<es>

@465

<es>

@472

<es>

@473
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, did you find anybody you like?"
<es>

@474

<es>

@479
<en>{Ran}\n"We haven't?"
<es>

<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's because you are always talking about money."
<es>

@481
<en>{Ran}\n"Maybe you're right.\nYou don't like girls talk about money?"
<es>

@482

<es>

@483
<en>{Ran}\n"Why? Is it funny?"
<es>

@484
