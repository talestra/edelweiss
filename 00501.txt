<es>

@114
<en>{Haruka}\n"Alchemy we study in this school is very practical. It's nothing like witchcraft."
<es>

@115
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Witchcraft was actually exactly what I imagined when I first heard alchemy."
<es>

@116

@146
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Because your lunch was so good.\nI feel like cooking."

@149
<en>{Haruka}\n"For me?"

<en>She's really an earnest student.
<es>

@172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's O.K to be late sometimes. We are not perfect."
<es>

@173
<en>I forced her to taste my dish.
<es>

@174
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please start."
<es>

@175
<en>She gave up insisting to go to the class.
<es>

@178
<en>{Haruka}\n"All right. I didn't know you are aggressive sometimes."
<es>

@179
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You will find out a lot about me in the future."
<es>

@182
<en>{Haruka}\n"O.k. I'll first find out how good you are as a cook."
<es>

@183
<en>She took a big bite.
<es>

@184
<en>{Haruka}\n"Haruka eating"

<en>{Kazushi}\n"Actually that is the only dish I can cook. But all my family loves it."
<es>

@202
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm gald you liked it too."
<es>

@205
<en>{Haruka}\n"Your family's favorite? I can believe that."
<es>

@206
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They didn't mind eating it everyday."
<es>

@209
<en>{Haruka}\n"You were cooking everyday?"
<es>

@210
<en>She starts throwing questions.
<es>

@211
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We had a problem in family one time...that's when I used to cook..."
<es>

@212
<en>My little sister lost appetite from the problem we had.
<es>

@213
<en>That's when I thought about cooking egg-rice hoping she will gain back her appetite.
<es>

@214
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She starts getting back her appetite as I get better at cooking it."
<es>

@215
<en>I'm confident I did a lots of practice on cooking that dish.
<es>

@216
<en>My little sister took my egg-rice over any expensive food.
<es>

@219
<en>{Haruka}\n"I see."
<es>

@220
<en>I'm glad she didn't ask further details about the problems we had.
<es>

@221
<en>{Haruka}\n"I can tell you practiced a lot for this."
<es>

@222
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wanted to make my little sister happy."
<es>

@225
<en>{Haruka}\n"I see your point......"
<es>

@226
<en>She got my point.
<es>

@227
<en>{Haruka}\n"This, you can't with alchemy......"
<es>

@228
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think you can make good food without alchemy."
<es>

@231
<en>{Haruka}\n"You are right. You can add the taste of love with alchemy."
<es>

@234
<en>{Haruka}\n"Maybe I was depending too much on alchemy whatever I do."
<es>

@235
<en>She's looking at her own hands.
<es>

@238
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm actually not good at cooking.\nI learned alchemy before cooking."
<es>

@239
<en>{Haruka}\n"It was so easy to change my bad dishes to good one with alchemy."
<es>

@240
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's why I never learned what really makes food great taste."
<es>

@241
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I had to struggle so much to come up with just one menu."
<es>

@244
<en>{Haruka}\n"I think that's how it supposed to be."
<es>

@245
<en>She smiles with lonely face.
<es>

@246
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not criticizing you, you know?"
<es>

@247
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Your way of learning cooking is probably very normal around here."
<es>

@250
<en>{Haruka}\n"No, I'm glad you gave me a good lesson."
<es>

@251
<en>She showed me a good smile.
<es>

@254

<es>

@255
<en>{Haruka}\n"What is your favorite food?"
<es>

@256
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Me......?\nCurry rice and noodles."
<es>

@259
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's something a 3-year old would like!"
<es>

@260
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're right.\nBut most boys are like me, though."
<es>

@261
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi, you have to give another try."
<es>

@264
<en>{Haruka}\n"Next time, I will make you say "this is delicious" from bottom of your heart."
<es>

@265
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't get me wrong, it was delicious."
<es>

@266
<en>That's not a lie. And I think she knows it was.
<es>

@269
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ofcourse. I did put on my best alchemy spell on that lunch."
<es>

@270
<en>As soon as she said that she stopped her mouth.
<es>

@273
<en>{Haruka}\n"But don't expect too much next time, O.K? I'm not really good at cooking."
<es>

@274
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry. I'll be happy just by the fact you cooked for me."
<es>

@275
<en>{Haruka}\n"All right. Then, expect me to bring your lunch without high expectation, O.K?"
<es>

@276
