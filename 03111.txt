@6
<en>I snuck up quietly and peeked inside the door.
<es>

@12
<en>{Haruka}\n"I want to know what that experiment was for! Why won't you answer me?"
<es>

@13
<en>I could hear them without even pressing my ear to the door. Haruka pressed in on the principal...\nWhat did she mean by experiment?
<es>

@17
<en>{Principal}\n"I don't see the reason why I should even be hearing that question from you."
<es>

@22
<en>{Haruka}\n"Because!"
<es>

@23
<en>Haruka seemed very upset. It was rare to see her so angry.
<es>

@24
<en>{Principal}\n"I still don't appreciate the fact that you were there.\nWhat were you doing with that class to begin with?"
<es>

@25
<en>{Haruka}\n"Whatever I choose to do is up to me. I'm not some puppet who follows your commands, Grandma."
<es>

@28
<en>Haruka made a strong statement, but for some reason, the principal starts laughing.
<es>

@29
<en>{Haruka}\n"What's so funny?"
<es>

@32
<en>{Principal}\n"You like him, don't you?"
<es>

@35
<en>{Haruka}\n"...ah!"
<es>

@36
<en>Haruka was lost for words. Who's "him"?
<es>

@37
<en>{Principal}\n"You've been suckered by a fool."
<es>

@40
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't get what you're talking about."
<es>

@43
<en>{Principal}\n"I'm not criticizing you. This proves you're maturing."
<es>

@44
<en>{Haruka}\n"I thought you were going to let me take care of Kazushi-kun!"
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What......?"
<es>

@46
<en>Why are they talking about me?\n......what did she mean by taking care of me?
<es>

@47
<en>{Haruka}\n"Why didn't you let me handle it myself? Wouldn't everything be ruined if something had happened to him?!"
<es>

@50
<en>{Principal}\n"Because it was better than nothing. You haven't shown any progress after an entire month."
<es>

@51
<en>{Principal}\n"What have you been doing this whole time?"
<es>

@54
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's only been a month. Why are we in such a hurry?"
<es>

@55
<en>{Principal}\n"We aren't in a hurry. I'm just saying that there's no reason to take longer than necessary."
<es>

@58
<en>{Haruka}\n"But we need more data. If we don't observe......"
<es>

@61
<en>{Principal}\n"That's why I gathered more data. You can't collect any more data just by watching him."
<es>

@64
<en>{Haruka}\n"Well... Still! That experiment was too risky! What were you planning to do with everyone there?!"
<es>

@65
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What experiment?\n...AH!"
<es>

@68
<en>She must be talking about the experiment where we all had to keep watch over the principal's fire. There was something weird about it...
<es>

@69
<en>No, that experiment was full of weird things. In the end, Natsume-chan popped out of that flask.
<es>

@74
<en>{Haruka}\n"I was terrified when I realized it after the fact! What if Natsume-chan hadn't shown up?"
<es>

@75
<en>Why had she been scared? She made it sound like Natsume-chan had showed up to save us...
<es>

@76
<en>{Haruka}\n"Natsume-chan's appearance was a miscalculation on your part, wasn't it, Grandma?"
<es>

@79
<en>{Principal}\n"Yes. I certainly never expected her to interfere with it. I wonder what brought about such a change of heart."
<es>

@80
<en>I thought Natsume-chan simply appeared. What did she do? What happened without us noticing?
<es>

@81
<en>{Haruka}\n"What would have happened if Natsume-chan hadn't decided to show up?"
<es>

@84
<en>{Principal}\n"I think you know the answer."
<es>

@87
<en>{Haruka}\n"I can't believe you......!"
<es>

@88
<en>Haruka screamed in disbelief.
<es>

@89
<en>{Haruka}\n"Then what about all of us?! Were you just going to watch us all die?!"
<es>

@90
<en>Watch us die? This is a surprisingly violent topic.
<es>

@91
<en>{Principal}\n"You're over-exaggerating. That was not a large enough experiment to cause such an impact."
<es>

@92
<en>{Principal}\n"It was only an average sized large flask. Altering the spatiality for one person is all it could do."
<es>

@95
<en>{Haruka}\n"Even one person makes it a human experiment! Who would have been sacrificed if Natsume-chan hadn't stopped it?!"
<es>

@96
<en>Sacrificed? What the hell are they talking about?
<es>

@99
<en>{Principal}\n"Sacrifice?\nNow, you're really exaggerating."
<es>

@101
<en>{Haruka}\n"I knew there was something wrong as soon as I saw the list of equipment. You wouldn't normally leave that in the care of students without at least being guided by their teacher, Mei-chan."
<es>

@105
<en>{Haruka}\n"Even I wasn't much help after slipping in there..."
<es>

@108
<en>{Principal}\n"If you really want to help then remember this: you must never get taken in. You always need to remain a passive observer."
<es>

@111
<en>{Principal}\n"You learned a good lesson."
<es>

@114
<en>{Haruka}\n"How can you say that? Are dead people more important to you than those who are still alive, Grandma?"
<es>

@115
<en>Haruka's statement was brutal.
<es>

@118
<en>{Principal}\n".................."
<es>

@119
<en>The principal lost her calm composure and fell silent. It looked like Haruka's words hurt her more than I'd imagined.
<es>

@122
<en>{Principal}\n"You can think whatever you want about this."
<es>

@125
<en>Haruka looked at her with pity.
<es>

@126
<en>{Haruka}\n"Then I don't think I can follow your path any longer."
<es>

@127
<en>Haruka protested quietly. I could hear the sadness in her voice.
<es>

@128
<en>The principal couldn't do anything but sigh. She looked like someone who had given up on everything.
<es>

@131
<en>{Principal}\n"You don't understand how I feel because you've never lost anything important."
<es>

@134
<en>{Haruka}\n"Fine. And I don't want to know."
<es>

@135
<en>Their two opinions clashed directly with each other. And here I thought they got along great.
<es>

@136
<en>{Haruka}\n"...Could something like that happen again?"
<es>

@139
<en>{Principal}\n"So long as you fail to produce results, then I will play my hand as I wish. Otherwise, what was the point in making this school co-ed?"
<es>

@142
<en>{Haruka}\n"......I understand.\nI will get the result you want."
<es>

@143
<en>{Principal}\n"You do that."
<es>

@147
<en>Their tense conversation was finally over.
<es>

@148
<en>{Haruka}\n"Excuse me."
<es>

@150
<en>Oops. Haruka's leaving...
<es>

@152
<en>*SLAM*
<es>

@153
<en>The door opened before I could hide.
<es>

@156
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ah!"
<es>

@157
<en>We were right in front of each other.
<es>

@158
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm......"
<es>

@159
<en>It was a very long and awkward moment.
<es>

@160
<en>{Principal}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@161
<en>The principal noticed that something was wrong just outside her door. Haruka stepped in front of me so that I couldn't be seen.
<es>

@164
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's nothing. Excuse me."
<es>

@166
<en>*SLAM*
<es>

@167
<en>Haruka closed the door. I could see that she was still worked up.
<es>

@168
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey......"
<es>

@171
<en>{Haruka}\n"Shh!"
<es>

@172
<en>She covered my mouth.
<es>

@173
<en>{Haruka}\n(Be quiet. She can still hear you.)
<es>

@174
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah!"
<es>

@175
<en>{Haruka}\n(Let's get out of here.)
<es>

@178
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@181
<en>{Haruka}\n".........it's OK now."
<es>

@182
<en>I took a deep breath.
<es>

@183
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That was scary."
<es>

@188
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's my line. What were you doing there?"
<es>

@189
<en>Her question finally reminded me why I'd went there in the first place.
<es>

@190
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah!\nI went back there to get my stuff."
<es>

@192
<en>I ended up not getting what I came for.
<es>

@195
<en>{Haruka}\n"You went back there to pick up something you forgot? So you were there by coincidence?"
<es>

@196
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course it was only a coincidence. You sure ask weird questions."
<es>

@199
<en>{Haruka}\n"I didn't say anything suspicious, did I?"
<es>

@200
<en>It's hard to work out what she's talking about today.
<es>

@201
<en>Including what she was saying to the principal.
<es>

@202
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What was the conversation with the principal about......?"
<es>

@205
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's nothing important. And not something you should worry about."
<es>

@206
<en>The fact that she was trying to lie to me only made me more worried.
<es>

@207
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It isn't?"
<es>

@208
<en>{Haruka}\n"Nope. Uh-huh."
<es>

@209
<en>I know she's lying to me. My name came up in their conversation too.
<es>

@212
<en>{Haruka}\n"Do you need to get what you forgot today, or can it wait?"
<es>

@213
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, it can wait. I just thought I'd pick it up before I forgot about it."
<es>

@216
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh yeah?\nWell then, why don't we go out somewhere together?"
<es>

@217
<en>She's definitely trying to change the subject. However, I don't mind going out with her......
<es>

@218
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure!"
<es>

@221
<en>{Haruka}\n"Right, let's go!"
<es>

@222
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK, where do you want to head off to? And hey, let me get the rest of the guys first."
<es>

@225
<en>{Haruka}\n"Wait! Hold on!"
<es>

@226
<en>I hit the brakes before I really got running.
<es>

@227
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@230
<en>{Haruka}\n"Why are you getting your friends?"
<es>

@231
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean "why"? I thought we were all going to head into the village and have some fun."
<es>

@232
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Am I missing something here?"
<es>

@233
<en>AM I missing something here? Haruka looked at me with a troubled smile, and then lowered her long eyelashes.
<es>

@236
<en>{Haruka}\n"Do you prefer going out with everybody?"
<es>

@237
<en>She made my heart stop.
<es>

@238
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did you mean...you wanted to go out just by ourselves?"
<es>

@241
<en>{Haruka}\n"Of course I did."
<es>

@242
<en>She said "Of course"! Just the two of us!
<es>

@243
<en>All of a sudden, I'm feeling pressure drop on me.
<es>

@246
<en>{Haruka}\n"Don't tell me you're actually busy or doing your homework all of a sudden."
<es>

@247
<en>She asked reluctantly.\nMaybe my relaxed attitude was making her nervous...\nBe a man, Kazushi!
<es>

@248
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My day is wide open!"
<es>

@251
<en>{Haruka}\n"Really? Then we're good to go?"
<es>

@252
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course we are! Is there some place you wanna go?"
<es>

@253
<en>Haruka answered my question by nodding her head.
<es>
