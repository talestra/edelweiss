<en>{Daigo}\n"Anything good happen today?"
<es>

@10
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nothing much."
<es>

@15
<en>{Appo}\n"What're you guys doing? Summer break will be over before you know it!"
<es>

@16
<en>The winner speaks. We didn't need him to tell us that, but nothing dramatic was going to happen all of a sudden.
<es>

@21
<en>{Pierre}\n"Can you help peel the skin off my back?"
<es>

@22
<en>Pierre took off his shirt and turned his naked back to me.
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure, I'll peel it neatly for you."
<es>

@24
<en>One portion of his shoulder was already peeling off, and it gave me an idea of where to start from.
<es>

@30
<en>{Appo}\n"If you handle it just right, it'll come off great."
<es>

@33
<en>{Daigo}\n"Let's see how big a piece you can get off at once."
<es>

@38
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah, try it, Kazushi. If it's big enough, maybe we can show it to the girls!"
<es>

@39
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Your skin? Won't they just be disgusted again?"
<es>

@42
<en>{Pierre}\n"It doesn't matter what the topic of conversation is. My smooth talking skills will handle the rest."
<es>

@43
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see.\nNow I got it."
<es>

@45
<en>I carefully pinched where the skin was starting to peel back.
<es>

@48
<en>{Daigo}\n"Be careful."
<es>

@49
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know."
<es>

@51
<en>I pulled on it very slowly.
<es>

@53
<en>It's going well.
<es>

@56
<en>{Appo}\n"Yeah! You're peeling it nicely!"
<es>

@57
<en>His skin was still in one piece, getting cleanly peeled off.
<es>

@62
<en>{Daigo}\n"That must feel great. Let me try it too."
<es>

@63
<en>Daigo was good with his hands, despite his size.
<es>

@64
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Alright. Make sure you do a good job."
<es>

@68
<en>{Daigo}\n"I will."
<es>

@69
<en>Daigo took over.

@74
<en>{Pierre}\n"Wow, I can feel it coming off! Is it still in one piece?"
<es>

@78
<en>{Appo}\n"Yes, it is. At this rate, your whole back could be peeled off in one piece."
<es>

@82
<en>{Pierre}\n"Seriously!?"
<es>

@84
<en>Appo wasn't exaggerating.
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Daigo! Be careful!"
<es>

@88
<en>{Daigo}\n"Got it."
<es>

@90
<en>His thick fingers were moving delicately. It was like watching an experienced chef peeling the thin skin off a big daikon.
<es>

@93
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, guys, haven't you almost made it to the middle part of my back? Is it still really in one piece?"
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes it is!\nKeep it going, Daigo!"
<es>

@98
<en>{Daigo}\n"I won't screw this up."
<es>

<es>

@101
<en>We reached his waist.\nI think this is some kind of new record.
<es>

@102

<es>

@105
<en>{Daigo}\n"......got it!!"
<es>

@106
<en>We did it!\nWe peeled off his entire back skin in one piece!!
<es>

@111
<en>{Pierre}\n"Show it to me!!"
<es>

@118
<en>{Appo}\n"I've never seen anything like this before!"
<es>

@119
<en>{Pierre}\n"It's huge!"
<es>

@120
<en>It was, of course, as big as his entire back. It was truly impressive.
<es>

@121
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't think we could do it!\nDaigo, you're awesome!!"
<es>

@122
<en>{Daigo}\n"Give credit to Pierre for burning himself so evenly."
<es>

@125
<en>{Pierre}\n"It's not me.\nDaigo, you should get all the credit!"
<es>

@126
<en>{Daigo}\n"Thanks......"
<es>

@129
<en>{Appo}\n"Well......"
<es>

@130
<en>Appo was staring at the layer of skin.\nHe usually came up with some weird ideas when he was like this.
<es>

@131
<en>{Appo}\n"You think...... we can eat this?"
<es>

@138
<en>{Boys}\n"What?"
<es>

@141
<en>{Appo}\n"The texture reminds me of a crepe."
<es>

@144
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh, you're right! It looks thin and fluffy, just like a fresh made crepe!"
<es>

@147
<en>{Appo}\n"You know, girls love sweets. And here we are with a special, sweet looking crepe-like skin. The dots are connecting, aren't they, Pierre-kun."
<es>

@148
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you guys perhaps thinking..."
<es>

@151
<en>{Pierre}\n"Girls do similar things, right? They put some hair from the boy they like inside their pillow so they can fall in love with him."
<es>

@154
<en>{Daigo}\n"What!? Are you trying to make a girl...?!"
<es>

@155
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't do that! Remember what kind of hell we went through last year?"
<es>

@160
<en>At our last school, Appo was absent from school for a week. We got worried and went to visit his house.
<es>

@161
<en>When we got there he was fine, and even invited us in for dinner. Then, after we had all had our fill, he told us the reason he was absent...
<es>

@164
<en>{Appo}\n"I had my circumcision. In preparation for the coming crusade!"
<es>

@165
<en>We were laughing until he continued.
<es>

@168
<en>{Appo}\n"I thought I brought back some of it with me as a memory. I seem to have lost it somewhere."
<es>

@169
<en>......the hot pot dinner he treated us that night was of vegetables and offal.
<es>

@170
<en>We all got mentally sick from 'what if' and had to miss school for a week.
<es>

@171
<en>We named this 'The Appo Skin Incident'.
<es>

@180
<en>{Appo}\n"Don't stop me, Kazushi! I have a feeling that everything will be fine this time!"
<es>

@183
<en>{Daigo}\n"There are millions of reasons why it won't be fine."
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What does it bring us, even if it did work well?!"
<es>

@190
<en>{Appo}\n"What? Oh my! You made this, Pierre-kun? It looks so delicious...!"
<es>

@191
<en>{Pierre}\n"Thanks. I'm actually studying to be a confectioner. A patented one."
<es>

@196
<en>{Daigo}\n"The confectioner's one stickler about copyrights."
<es>

@202
<en>{Appo}\n"That's great! We didn't know you had such a dream!"
<es>

@203
<en>{Pierre}\n"Ah, but a confectioner is artist! I add decoration to soft, squishy sponge cakes with my fresh creme!"
<es>

@208
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I never knew he was such an idiot."
<es>

@209
<en>{Daigo}\n"Me neither."
<es>

@215
<en>{Pierre}\n"And...... I wanna be the creme to decorate you......"
<es>

@216
<en>{Appo}\n"Oh no! You're making me wet! Now that I'm wet, color me with nightly decoration!"
<es>

@219
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oui monsieur! Tres Bien! France Pan! Champs Elysees Story!"
<es>

@220
<en>{Appo}\n"I-I-I see it! The Arc de Triumph! The Arc de Triumph!"
<es>

@221
<en>{Pierre}\n"Bonjour! Bonjour! Mademoiselle!"
<es>

@222
<en>{Appo}\n"Ahaahn! Pierre's Effiel Tower! It's growing taller and taller!"
<es>

@225
<en>{Pierre}\n"Or so that's about what we expect."
<es>

@228
<en>{Appo}\n"You heard him."
<es>

@233
<en>{Boys}\n"What do you think?"
<es>

@234
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you out of your mind? Are you guys stupid!?"
<es>

@237
<en>{Appo}\n"Excuse us. We're off to grab some honey from the cafeteria."
<es>

@240
<en>{Pierre}\n"Arc de Triumph!"
<es>

@248
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Should we leave them alone? I have a feeling they'll get us into trouble again if we go with them."
<es>

@251
<en>{Daigo}\n"It should be all right. Why don't we go take a shower?"
<es>

@252
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How can you be so calm......?"
<es>

@261
<en>{Appo}\n"......"
<es>

@262
<en>{Pierre}\n"......"
<es>

@263
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What happened to you guys!?"
<es>

@270
<en>{Daigo}\n"Panchu-sempai did it, didn't he?"
<es>

@271
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why did he do that!?"
<es>

@272
<en>{Daigo}\n"Around this time of day he's usually in the kitchen baking bread. He probably made them tell the truth and took care of them."
<es>

@273
<en>{Appo}\n"Why didn't you tell us he'd be in there?"
<es>

@274
<en>{Pierre}\n"He almost put us in the oven!!"
<es>

@275
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You didn't make him eat it or anything, right?"
<es>

@276
<en>{Appo}\n"No, apparently he really hates European sweets like crepes."
<es>

@277
<en>{Pierre}\n"He started going crazy as soon as he saw the skin."
<es>

@278
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't understand anything that's happened today."
<es>

@281
<en>{Daigo}\n"Think of it as divine punishment."
<es>

@282
<en>{Pierre}\n"Our skin of dreams is in pieces!"
<es>
