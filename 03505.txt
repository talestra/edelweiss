<en>{Kazushi}\n"I hope there's still some food left for me..."
<es>

@8
<en>It was almost 2PM. I know it's summer break, but I really slept late.
<es>

@9
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I slept for over ten hours... No wonder I'm so hungry."
<es>

@10
<en>I'd starve to death if I didn't get to eat anything until dinner. Unfortunately, I didn't see anybody at the counter.
<es>

@11
<en>None of the old cafeteria ladies who usually ladled out our lunch with a smile were there.
<es>

@12
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hello.\nIs anyone working!!?\nI'm starving!!"
<es>

@13
<en>I made a pitiful voice, hoping somebody would hear me in the kitchen.
<es>

@14
<en>{Cafeteria Lady}\n"Oh, hi.\nYou missed your lunch?"
<es>

@15
<en>The old lady had changed out of her apron and into her casual clothes, but that didn't stop me from begging her.
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't eat anything this morning. I'm dying!!"
<es>

@17
<en>{Cafeteria Lady}\n"You must be.\nYou should've woken up earlier.\nIt's your own fault."
<es>

@18
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wasn't sleeping!\nI was doing Mei-sensei a favour and cleaning up the library!"
<es>

@19
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't recall asking that favor of you."
<es>

@20
<en>Shit!
<es>

@21
<en>I snapped my head around while freaking out.
<es>

@26
<en>There was Mei-sensei, head of the library, enjoying her meal.
<es>

@27
<en>{Mei}\n"You even had to skip your lunch to help me out. I feel so terrible."
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"N-no... don't. I'm perfectly fine."
<es>

@31
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't say that. Haruma-kun, you look hungry, so let me treat you to lunch."
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No! You don't have to do it."
<es>

@33
<en>I was sleeping in! If I let her buy me lunch, who knows what the repercussions will be?
<es>

@36
<en>{Mei}\n"I think you should let me buy your lunch. After all, the result's going to be the same."
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It is?"
<es>

@38
<en>Whether I reject her offer or not, it looks like I'll be spending the afternoon doing chores for her.
<es>

@39
<en>{Mei}\n"What do you say?"
<es>

@40
<en>She never dropped her smile, which didn't exactly make me happy at the moment.
<es>

@41
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......thank you."
<es>

@42
<en>I should at least eat and get some energy for whatever she's going to make me do.
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's get it on!!"
<es>

@48
<en>{Mei}\n"You're so energetic! It seems like it was worth treating you to lunch."
<es>

@49
<en>I had fresh energy from lunch, but I also calmed down and realized something important: we cleaned the library right before the start of summer break.
<es>

@50
<en>It shouldn't be a lot of work.
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So where do we start?"
<es>

@52
<en>I asked her, knowing there wasn't too much to do.
<es>

@55
<en>{Mei}\n"Actually, I'd like to ask you to do some carpentry. The shelf over there is broken."
<es>

@56
<en>I followed her eyes to the deep end of the room.
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My......"
<es>

@58
<en>There was a bookshelf in the far corner of the room which was literally crumbling apart. The books that had fallen out just lay there on the floor.
<es>

@61
<en>{Mei}\n"It's too heavy for me to move it by myself."
<es>

@62
<en>Of course it was. There was a load of magic tomes as thick as phone books resting on it.
<es>

@63
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let me start by picking up the fallen books."
<es>

@64
<en>After that I'll need to repair the shelves, put the books back, and clean up...
<es>

@65
<en>I think it's going to take my entire afternoon.
<es>

@66
<en>I already used half of my day sleeping, and now I'm going to use the rest for this.
<es>

@67
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll start with these books."
<es>

@68
<en>Oh well. She bought me lunch, and it's my fault for oversleeping.
<es>

@71
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm so glad you're helping me out. We really needed to get some boys like you in."
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No worries. This is piece of cake for me."
<es>

@73
<en>I acted tough, but I really would've been better off doing this before lunch. Getting paid in advance halved my motivation.
<es>

@76
<en>{Mei}\n"Thanks again. I'll pay you back for this when we're finished."
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Eh? But you've already bought me lunch..."
<es>

@80
<en>{Mei}\n"That's because you were stumbling around due to hunger. That's why I thought I'd help you get some energy back."
<es>

@83
<en>{Mei}\n"But it takes more than just a meal to motivate you, right?"
<es>

@84
<en>She read me like a book. Mei-sensei was really good at understanding how I feel.
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, a meal was enough.\nI'm glad that I can help you out."
<es>

@86
<en>I actually did feel glad that I could. I really wanted to be encouraged and make myself of more use to her like this.
<es>

@87
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can count on me!!"
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Finally......"
<es>

@93
<en>It was almost getting dark by the time we finished everything.
<es>

@96
<en>{Mei}\n"Great job. Here's a towel."
<es>

@97
<en>She handed me a cold towel she'd prepared for me in advance. It was nice and cool.
<es>

@100
<en>{Mei}\n"It turned out much better than I expected. I didn't know you were so good with your hands, Haruma-kun. Reliable guys like that are wonderful."
<es>

@101
<en>She knew how to make me happy.
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You really mean what you said?"
<es>

@105
<en>{Mei}\n"Of course I do. You should be more confident about yourself."
<es>

@106
<en>Her smile made me wanna believe her.
<es>

@109
<en>{Mei}\n"Thanks again. I'm glad you're here for me."
<es>

@110
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How did you take care of problems like this before the boys got here?"
<es>

@111
<en>{Mei}\n"We used to have to ask someone from the town to come help. Like the older man from the general store who comes and goes."
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"General store? ...Oh."
<es>

@113
<en>Miya-san, that was his name.
<es>

@114
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But I don't remember him hiring anyone else. Wasn't it hard for him to leave the shop empty and come help you out?"
<es>

@117
<en>{Mei}\n"That was the problem. We always had to wait until he had a day off first."
<es>

@120
<en>{Mei}\n"Besides, he's not as reliable as you are."
<es>

@121
<en>Mei-sensei spoke with a bitter smile. He sure didn't seem so reliable...
<es>

@124
<en>{Mei}\n"It's a big comfort to have boys like you here with us. There's all these inconveniences, plus it's dangerous with just girls. Just having you guys here puts us at ease."
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks......"
<es>

@126
<en>Even I felt bashful after sensei went that far. I couldn't help but grin.
<es>

@129
<en>{Mei}\n"Can I ask you for some more favors during summer break?"
<es>

@130
<en>Her big attractive eyes were peering into my soul. I felt like she could suck my whole body into her eyes.
<es>
