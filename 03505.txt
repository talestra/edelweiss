<en>It's almost 2 o'clock in the afternoon.\nI know it's summer break, but I really slept in.
<es>

@9
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I slept more than 10 hours.\nNo wonder why I'm so hungry."
<es>

@10
<en>I would starve to death if I don't eat anything till tonight.\nUnfortunately, I don't see anyone around.
<es>

@11
<en>I don't see anyone working here.
<es>

<es>

@13

<en>{Cafeteria lady}\n"Oh, hi.\nYou missed your lunch?"
<es>

@15

<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't eat anything this morning.\nI'm dying!!"
<es>

@17
<en>{Cafeteria lady}\n"You must be.\nYou should've woken up earlier.\nIt's your own fault."
<es>

@18
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wasn't sleeping!\nI was doing a favor for my teacher to clean up the library."
<es>

@19
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't remember asking that favor to you."
<es>

@20
<en>Opps!!
<es>

@21
<en>I turned my head around freaking out.
<es>

@26
<en>There she is enjoying her meal.
<es>

@27
<en>{Mei}\n"You even had to skip your lunch to help me out.\nI feel so terrible."
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm......you're welcome."
<es>

@31
<en>{Mei}\n"I guess I owe you a lunch."
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No!\nYou don't have to do it."
<es>

@33
<en>I was sleeping.\nIf I let her buy my lunch, I don't know what is going to happen later.
<es>

@36
<en>{Mei}\n"I think you should let me buy your lunch.\nThe deal is already concluded."
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The deal?"
<es>

<es>

@39
<en>{Mei}\n"What do you say?"
<es>

@40
<en>She doesn't put off her smile which I can't be so happy about right now.
<es>

@41
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......thank you."
<es>

@42
<en>I should at least eat and get some energy for whatever she's going to make me do.
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's get it on!!"
<es>

@48
<en>{Mei}\n"You are so energetic!\nIt seems it was worth buying you a lunch."
<es>

@49
<en>I just remembered we cleaned up our library right before summer break started.
<es>

@50
<en>It shouldn't be a lot of work.
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What should we start from?"
<es>

@52
<en>I asked her knowing there is not much to do.
<es>

@55
<en>{Mei}\n"I actually want you to fix one of the book shelf."
<es>

@56
<en>I followed her eyes to the deep end of the room.
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My......"
<es>

@58
<en>The book shelf in the deep corner of the room is literary crumbled
<es>

@61
<en>{Mei}\n"It's too heavy for me to move it."
<es>

@62
<en>Ofcourse not.\nThe books that are still on the shelf seems to be just as thick as telephone guides.
<es>

@63
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let me start by taking those books off the broken shelves."
<es>

@64
<en>And then I fix the shelf and then clean it up ......
<es>

@65
<en>I think it's going to take my entire afternoon.
<es>

@66
<en>I already used a half of my day sleeping and now I'm going to use the rest for this.

<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No worries.\nThis is piece of cake for me."
<es>

@73
<en>To be honest, it feels more like a burden since this has been already paid by eating lunch earlier.
<es>

@76
<en>{Mei}\n"Thanks again.\nI will pay you back when we are finished."
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"? You already bought me a lunch."
<es>

@80
<en>{Mei}\n"That was just to make you gain some energy for this."
<es>

@83
<en>{Mei}\n"You want more than just meals, don't you?"
<es>

@84
<en>She's really good at reading my mind.
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. That lunch was enough.\nI'm willing to help you."
<es>

<es>

@101
<en>She knows how to make me happy.
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You really mean what you said?"
<es>

@105
<en>{Mei}\n"Ofcourse I do. You should be more confident about yourself."
<es>

@106
<en>Her smile makes me wanna believe her.
<es>

@109
<en>{Mei}\n"Thanks again. I'm glad you're here for me."
<es>

@110
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How did you take care of these problems before us boys are here."
<es>

@111
<en>{Mei}\n"We used to have to go to town and ask for help. Someone like Mr.Miya."
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......oh, the grocery shop owner."
<es>

@113
<en>Mr.Miya, that was his name.
<es>

@114
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But I don't remember him hiring anyone else.\nWasn't it hard for him to leave the shop empty and come help you out?"
<es>

@117
<en>{Mei}\n"That is true.\nWe had to wait till his first next off-day."
<es>

@120
<en>{Mei}\n"Besides, he is not as dependable as you are."
<es>

@121
<en>He sure seems not so dependable.
<es>

@124
<en>{Mei}\n"We are also glad that you boys are here now for the safety reasons, too."
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks......"
<es>

@126

<es>

@129
<en>{Mei}\n"Can I ask you more favors during the summer break?"
<es>
