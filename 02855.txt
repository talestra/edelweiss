@7
<en>Twilight. The sun was slowly coming to a rest below the horizon.
<es>

@8
<en>I found her on the tip of the cape.
<es>

@11
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mei-sensei?"
<es>

@14
<en>{Mei}\n"......is that you, Haruma-kun?"
<es>

@17
<en>It was getting dark, so she wasn't sure. She finally realized it was me when I walked closer, waving my hand. A lovely smile crossed her face.
<es>

@20
<en>{Mei}\n"Good day. Or should I already say good evening?"
<es>

@21
<en>She kept looking up at the sky. The western sky was still glowing with the orange sunset, while the eastern sky was painted with the ultramarine of night.
<es>

@22
<en>Just between day and night. The crepuscule.
<es>

@25
<en>{Mei}\n"What are you doing here so late? It's almost dinner time."
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I was just taking a walk. What are you doing here?"
<es>

@29
<en>{Mei}\n"I was out for a walk myself. I like the view up here this time of night."
<es>

@30
<en>Even though it couldn't exactly be called a night view, the lights were starting to appear in the houses below.
<es>

@31
<en>The sparse, dotted lights of the town only served to make it more forlorn.
<es>

@32
<en>Even then, it was almost like you could smell the ideal dinners cooking in each household.
<es>

@35
<en>{Mei}\n"The way that light and time become vague and lose their identities at this hour makes me feel like I could blend into nature."
<es>

@38
<en>{Mei}\n"And then I can start losing my own sense of existence. It's like I can turn into something I'm not."
<es>

@39
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh..."
<es>

@40
<en>I didn't understand anything she was saying. All I knew was that she looked so alone.
<es>

@41
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Everybody would miss you if you turned into someone else. If there's something troubling you, I'm here to listen."
<es>

@44
<en>{Mei}\n"That's not it. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause you any concern for me."
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's good then..."
<es>

@46
<en>The sky changed color from orange and pink to a deep purple and an inky black. Night set in like a film being watched at high speed.
<es>

@47
<en>It was getting too dark to even see her face clearly.
<es>

@50
<en>{Mei}\n"Did you know that some say the word dusk comes from a Northumbrian variant of 'ask'?'"
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ask? Ask... usk... dusk. I can see it."
<es>

@54
<en>{Mei}\n"It's because this is a time when darkness begins to settle, and though you can tell someone else is there, you can't see and have to ask who it is."
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Just like how you asked me just now."
<es>

@58
<en>{Mei}\n"Yeah. I could kind of tell it was you but I wasn't sure. How could you have been so certain that it was me?"
<es>

@59
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It was easy."
<es>

@60
<en>Anybody could have figured out it was her by the perfect silhouette.
<es>

@61
<en>Even on this island full of girls, no one else had her perfect style.
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can tell when it's you no matter how far away I'm looking from."
<es>

@63
<en>{Mei}\n"You can? That's amazing. Even I can't always recognize myself..."
<es>

@64
<en>She turned to me and formed a melancholy smile. It seemed so faint and fragile that it could be lost to the dusk at any moment.
<es>

@65
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this what people mean when they say they're trying to find themselves?"
<es>

@68
<en>{Mei}\n"Might be.\nYou're very sharp for a boy your age."
<es>

@69
<en>She smiled as she praised me. I didn't think I'd guess right. Maybe she's just toying with me.
<es>

@72
<en>{Mei}\n"Hey, Haruma-kun, how do I appear to you?"
<es>

@73
<en>{Kazushi}\n"To me?"
<es>

@74
<en>At first I thought she was asking me in a sexual manner, but the mournful look in her eyes made me realize that I was thinking too much.
<es>

@75
<en>She continued staring at me, waiting for my answer. Her expression was covered in the veil of dusk and I couldn't make it out.
<es>

@76
<en>The dark continued to spread over the horizon and the cape. It was hard to see her face now, and I felt I had to say something quickly.
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think you're the perfect example of what it means to be a lady. You're very beautiful and kind, intelligent, independent, and funny too..."
<es>

@78
<en>The more I thought about it, the more I realized just how perfect she was. I was very lucky to have her as my teacher, and that by itself has made it worth coming to the island.
<es>

@79
<en>...and I just realized that it must have sounded like I was trying to make a move on her.
<es>

@82
<en>{Mei}\n"I see...\nBut does such a perfect person really exist?"
<es>

@83
<en>She asked me that as if she was talking about someone else.\nThere's something strange about her today.
<es>

@84
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I'm sure that everyone would say the same thing.\n...by the way, why are you me asking this?"
<es>

@87
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't you ever want to know how other people feel about you? None of us is able to truly judge ourselves without external input, don't you think?"
<es>

@88
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know. I've never really thought about it."
<es>

@89
<en>I've never thought about how other people think and feel about me. I'm genuinely impressed that she thinks about her appearance in other peoples' minds.
<es>

@92
<en>{Mei}\n"Maybe there aren't so many people who worry about it. But sometimes I do."
<es>

@93
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It really worries you that much?"
<es>

@94
<en>Mei-sensei seemed so different that I questioned my own eyes. As my sight became even vaguer, so too did her silhouette.
<es>

@95
<en>It's like she's fading into the dark.
<es>

@96
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mei-sensei......"
<es>

@97
<en>I reached out to touch her face, afraid that it was disappearing into the darkness.
<es>

@100
<en>{Mei}\n"Ah!"
<es>

@101
<en>She grabbed my hand as if by reflex. Her hand was sweating a tiny bit.
<es>

@104
<en>{Mei}\n"You surprised me."
<es>

@105
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry!\nI felt like you were disappearing......"
<es>

@108
<en>{Mei}\n"Disappearing? Me?"
<es>

@109
<en>Isn't this kind of romantic?
<es>

@110
<en>She looked into my eyes to decipher what I meant.\nI returned her gaze.\nIsn't this a bit romantic?
<es>

@111
<en>And that's why I didn't notice that there was a group of people walking towards us.
<es>

@114
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Do we really have to come all the way out here just to have a discussion?"
<es>

@117
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Grk!"
<es>

@118
<en>It's Mizuki. Crap, what's she doing up here?
<es>

@119
<en>She's not alone. There's someone else with her.
<es>

@122
<en>{Mei}\n"Haruma-kun, this way."
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right......"
<es>

@128
<en>Mei-sensei pulled me into the bushes so we could hide. We were right on top of one another.
<es>

@129
<en>My heart was pounding in my chest as I felt her body temperature.
<es>

@131
<en>{Mei}\n"It's Hinata-san. It looks like the other girl is a first year."
<es>

@135
<en>Mizuki and a tiny girl were looking at each other - I wonder what they're doing here? I sensed something odd in the air so I watched them in silence.
<es>

@136
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You needed to talk to me?"
<es>

@137
<en>Mizuki offered to listen, but it was with great reluctance.
<es>

@138
<en>{Girl 1}\n"...Sempai, are you in love with anybody?"
<es>

@141
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? Why does it matter?"
<es>

@142
<en>Well that question came out of nowhere. I don't blame Mizuki for being surprised - I want to know too.
<es>

@143
<en>{Girl 1}\n"Are you?"
<es>

@146
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No. No I'm not."
<es>

@147
<en>She said that even more reluctantly than before. Again, no surprise - I know she doesn't like talking about private issues.
<es>

@150
<en>{Girl 1}\n"Ummm...If there's no one else, then...\nI love you, Mizuki-sempai! Please go out with me!"
<es>

@153
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What!?"
<es>

@154
<en>What's this? One of Mizuki's female friends just confessed her love to her!
<es>

@156
<en>Is she a lesbian? I'm seeing a real lesbian for the first time! What a scene I've stumbled upon.
<es>

@157
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I've heard this kind of thing happens in girls' schools..."
<es>

@160
<en>{Mei}\n"Because there haven't been boys around, the girls give each other chocolates on Valentine's Day. Hinata-san is one of the most popular."
<es>

@161
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can imagine."
<es>

@163
<en>Mizuki's rather tomboyish, and I can see how she'd attract a lot of girls. Not that she wants any of the attention.
<es>

@166
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well, I'm straight."
<es>

@167
<en>{Girl 1}\n"That's fine with me!"
<es>

@168
<en>Mizuki's friend kept trying to persuade her to try things out. It was clear, though, that Mizuki was getting annoyed.
<es>

@171
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That might be fine with you, but it's not all right with me! Why do you have to crush on me and not someone else?"
<es>

@172
<en>Mizuki muttered as if she was cursing her fate. Her friend wasn't about to give up, though.
<es>

@173
<en>{Girl 1}\n"I don't care if you hate me for now! Can I call you Onee-sama in the meantime?"
<es>

@176
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Call me Onee-sama???"
<es>

@177
<en>{Girl 1}\n"Onee-sama! I love you! I'm crazy about you!!"
<es>

@180
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Gyaah?!"
<es>

@182
<en>Wow! A girl is getting up close with another girl! She's burying her face in Mizuki's breasts!
<es>

@185
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Get off of me!! Stop touching my boobs!"
<es>

@186
<en>Oh my god. This isn't fair - I want a pretty girl to go insane about me and start feeling me up!
<es>

@189
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I said, GET OFF!"
<es>

@190
<en>{Girl 1}\n"Ahh!"
<es>

@194
<en>Mizuki threw her aside by force and took a few steps back.
<es>

@195
<en>{Girl 1}\n"Onee-sama, you're so cold!"
<es>

@198
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Leave me be! I'm straight!"
<es>

@201
<en>Mizuki ran away.
<es>

@203
<en>{Girl 1}\n"Wait! Onee-sama!!"
<es>

@204
<en>She dashed after Mizuki, refusing to give up the chase.
<es>

@209
<en>Silence settled back over us after those two were gone.
<es>

@210
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well...you don't see that every day. I didn't know that Mizuki was so popular."
<es>

@211
<en>I'm envious of Mizuki. But still, what a waste for a pretty girl like that to fall in love with someone who doesn't want her.
<es>

@212
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're an alumni from this school, too, right? You must've been very popular back in your day, weren't you?"
<es>

@215
<en>{Mei}\n"Me? I don't think so......"
<es>

@216
<en>She sounded hesitant and awkward. I know she was popular.
<es>

@217
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure? You must've been popular. Did that happen to you too?"
<es>

@220
<en>{Mei}\n"Maybe it did..."
<es>

@221
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How was it when you were a student here? Did you go out with anybody?"
<es>

@224
<en>{Mei}\n"Did I go out with anybody?"
<es>

@225
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah...\nOh, no, that's right, there weren't any boys here at that time, were there?"
<es>

@228
<en>{Mei}\n"Let's see...\nI can't remember..."
<es>

@229
<en>She only gave me vague answers. Being as beautiful as she is, Mei-sensei must have had a boyfriend from outside the school.
<es>

@230
<en>Wait a minute, she must have graduated from college to become a teacher.
<es>

@231
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You made up for lost time and partied through college, right? It makes me want to go..."
<es>

@234
<en>{Mei}\n"You go to college to study."
<es>

@235
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Even nowadays? All I hear about college is that it's four years to party before going to work. Does that mean you were a bookworm?"
<es>

@238
<en>{Mei}\n"I believe I was..."
<es>

@239
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You believe you were?"
<es>

@240
<en>She's been acting odd. I thought she was just being vague, but maybe she's not sure?
<es>

@241
<en>Why wasn't she sure about her own self? She was looking down at the ground.
<es>

@242
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did I ask something wrong?"
<es>

@243
<en>Maybe she had some bad memories from college.
<es>

@246
<en>{Mei}\n"No, you didn't.\nIt's just......"
<es>

@247
<en>She was mumbling. She looked unsure of whether or not she wanted to continue.
<es>

@250
<en>{Mei}\n"To tell you the truth......"
<es>

@251
<en>She stopped. She looked like she was struggling with herself.
<es>

@252
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If it's too hard for you then we don't have to talk about it. I'll just listen if it makes you feel better."
<es>

@253
<en>Her face told me she was relieved to hear that.
<es>

@256
<en>And she showed me her tender everyday smile.
<es>

@259
<en>{Mei}\n"I didn't know you were so mature. I'm impressed you can be so considerate."
<es>

@260
<en>I see. So she thought I was just a kid before.
<es>

@261
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm mature enough to care about other peoples' feelings. Did you really think I was just a kid?"
<es>

@262
<en>I couldn't believe that she saw me as a child.
<es>

@265
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sorry, I can't help but look at you boys as kids. You're so energetic, and always fooling around..."
<es>

@266
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't deny that......"
<es>

@267
<en>I don't blame her. We act like bunch of elementary school kids.
<es>

@268
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fine......"
<es>

@271
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't be upset with me. Now I know I can trust you, so I'll tell you."
<es>

@272
<en>She talked to me like a mother soothing her spoiled toddler.
<es>

@273
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not upset or anything. You still don't have to explain anything if you don't feel like it."
<es>

@276
<en>{Mei}\n"No, I want you to listen to me. Maybe it was destiny that you came to me when I felt like talking."
<es>

@277
<en>I sensed that she was going to share something important with me.
<es>

@282
<en>{Mei}\n"To tell you the truth, I don't have any memories of my past."
<es>

@283
<en>{Kazushi}\n"..................what?"
<es>

@284
<en>I didn't think I'd be that surprised.
<es>

@285
<en>{Mei}\n"To be more specific, I don't have any memories from before I began teaching here. The oldest thing I can remember is waking up in my room on this island."
<es>

@286
<en>So she just woke up one day on the island? Without any memories of her past...
<es>

@287
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Absolutely nothing? Not even from your childhood?"
<es>

@288
<en>She did a good job of covering all that up.
<es>

@289
<en>{Mei}\n"Nothing at all. I had no clue of who or where I was."
<es>

@290
<en>She didn't sound begrudging about it or curious about how it happened.
<es>

@291
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Could it be amnesia?"
<es>

@292
<en>Of course I'd heard of amnesia before, but only as a trope in bad anime and erogames.
<es>

@295
<en>{Mei}\n"Hisae-san told me I'd been in an accident."
<es>

@296
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hisae-san?"
<es>

@297
<en>Sounds familiar... But where did I hear it?
<es>

@300
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, sorry. I meant the principal. Aozora Hisae-san."
<es>

@301
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that's right."
<es>

@302
<en>Haruka's grandma was called Hisae.
<es>

@303
<en>But I'd never heard Mei-sensei call her that before...
<es>

@304
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does the principal know about the accident you had?"
<es>

@307
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes. According to her, it happened just when I returned to the island."
<es>

@308
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What kind of accident was it?"
<es>

@311
<en>{Mei}\n"It wasn't anything major. I fell down some stairs and must have smacked my head pretty hard."
<es>

@312
<en>Amnesia can be triggered that easily?
<es>

@313
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You went to see a doctor, right?"
<es>

@316
<en>{Mei}\n"I didn't have any scars or open cuts on my head, so the doctor told me that my memories should return soon."
<es>

@317
<en>She gave me a weak smile, but it didn't seem like something to smile about. I wondered what it was like to forget everything you ever knew about your past.
<es>

@318
<en>What if I lost all of my past memories?
<es>

@319
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@320
<en>It's hard to even imagine how that must feel. But it must leave someone very unsteady.
<es>

@321
<en>{Mei}\n"Why are you looking so serious?"
<es>

@322
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But..."
<es>

@325
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, there's nothing I can do about it. I just have to be patient, and maybe one day my memories will come back. Nothing else is wrong, and there's no hindrance to my life."
<es>

@326
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No hindrance..."
<es>

@327
<en>I never knew she carried such an burden. I'm sure she conducted herself so that others wouldn't notice, but I felt bad for being unable to.
<es>

@328
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@329
<en>I didn't know what to say to her. We saw a big tanker sailing along in the distance offshore.
<es>

@332
<en>{Mei}\n"What's the difference between me and that tanker?"
<es>

@333
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? You're completely different."
<es>

@336
<en>{Mei}\n"I might be a tanker."
<es>

@337
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think so."
<es>

@340
<en>{Mei}\n"How do you know? Maybe I was built in a shipyard."
<es>

@341
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think they build humans there."
<es>

@344
<en>{Mei}\n"You're not very imaginative."
<es>

@345
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you asking me if I dream?"
<es>

@348
<en>{Mei}\n"You're boring. I shouldn't have told you my past."
<es>

@349
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry......"
<es>

@350
<en>When someone as beautiful as her stares at you with contempt, you feel like you've done the most horrible thing you could possibly imagine.
<es>

@353
<en>{Mei}\n"Just kidding. I'm actually very thankful that you've been such a good listener."
<es>

@354
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You scared me. I thought you hated me for a second."
<es>

@357
<en>{Mei}\n"Of course not! You are my very precious student."
<es>

@358
<en>I'm glad to hear that, but I wanted to be more than that.
<es>

@359
<en>I wanted to be more than just her precious student.
<es>

@360
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mei-sensei......"
<es>

@361
<en>Do you love somebody?
<es>

@362
<en>I couldn't ask her. I wasn't brave enough to field that question to her.
<es>

@363
<en>{Mei}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@364
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's nothing. I hope you regain your memories soon."
<es>

@367
<en>{Mei}\n"I hope so too. Thank you."
<es>

@368
<en>She turned back to watch the sunset. I looked out at it too, but my mind was consumed with Mei-sensei.
<es>

@369
<en>What kind of man would she love? Probably somebody all matured, not like me.
<es>

@370
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, maybe......"
