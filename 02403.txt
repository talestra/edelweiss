<en>Lunchtime.
<es>

@8
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What the..."
<es>

@9
<en>When I got back from eating in the cafeteria, I noticed my ass felt funny.
<es>

@12
<en>{Appo}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@17
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Why are you feeling up your butt?"
<es>

@18
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not feeling up my butt.\nI don't feel my wallet in my back pocket."
<es>

@19
<en>It's not in my back pocket. It's not in my front pocket. I couldn't have put it anywhere else.
<es>

@26
<en>{Daigo}\n"But you bought lunch at the cafeteria?"
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So I must have brought it with me..."
<es>

@31
<en>{Pierre}\n"Then it's simple. It must have fallen out on your way here."
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It must have..."
<es>

@36
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You should go and look for it now before it gets stolen."
<es>

@38
<en>That's when we heard the bell. Lunchtime was over.
<es>

@39
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What should I do?"
<es>

@43
<en>{Ran}\n"What? What? Are you guys talking about money? What is it?"
<es>

@45
<en>Ran came straight for us when she entered the room. She's sharp. She must be able to smell money.
<es>

@46
<en>Though we were talking about losing money.
<es>

@47
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi lost his wallet."
<es>

@54
<en>{Ran}\n"WHAT!?\nYOU LOST YOUR WALLET!?"
<es>

@55
<en>Ran screamed loud enough for our entire class to hear her.
<es>

@58
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh my god!!"
<es>

@59
<en>She sounded like a village elder who just heard the seal on a cursed shrine was removed.
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's so drastic about that?"
<es>

@63
<en>{Ran}\n"Why the hell are you still here!?\nGO FIND IT!"
<es>

@64
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, the bell just rang. I can do it later......"
<es>

@67
<en>{Ran}\n"MORON!"
<es>

@68
<en>Her scream shook the windows and the class covered their ears.
<es>

@74
<en>{Appo}\n *plug*
<es>

@75
<en>{Daigo}\n"She's gonna break our eardrums..."
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Quit screaming. You're scaring everybody like that..."
<es>

@81
<en>{Ran}\n"And you're the one who's scaring me! Come on, let's go!"
<es>

@82
<en>She dragged me off to go find my wallet.
<es>

@83
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where are we going?"
<es>

@84
<en>{Ran}\n"We're going to find your wallet, of course! Quit being dense!"
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Dense?"
<es>

@91
<en>{Mei}\n"Please be seated, everybody!"
<es>

@92
<en>Mei-sensei came into our classroom to start her lecture. Oh yeah, our afternoon class was on the theory of alchemy.
<es>

@93
<en>{Mei}\n"Hey, you two, where are you going?"
<es>

@94
<en>Ran was so focused that she couldn't hear Mei-sensei addressing us.
<es>

@99
<en>{Ran}\n"Sorry, Mei-chan, we have important business to take care of, so we're ditching!"
<es>

@100
<en>She declared the fact that she was ditching Mei-sensei's class in front of everybody!
<es>

@105
<en>{Mei}\n"Ditch? Hey, wait a minute!"
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry, Mei-sensei!! Please let us go!"
<es>

@114
<en>{Ran}\n"......not here."
<es>

@115
<en>Ran was down on her hands and knees searching everywhere for my wallet, even under tables and vending machines.
<es>

@116
<en>The cafeteria floor was filthy after lunch break.
<es>

@117
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't have to get down on the floor. Come on, you'll get dirty."
<es>

@120
<en>{Ran}\n"How can you be so calm?! Shut up and search as if your life depended on it!"
<es>

@121
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Aren't you exaggerating a little bit? It'd hurt if I couldn't find it, but not that bad."
<es>

@124
<en>{Ran}\n"Of course it'd hurt. Losing your wallet is almost as bad as losing your heart!"
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Now you really are exaggerating..."
<es>

@126
<en>Though maybe it meant that for hers. I never expected her to be so caring about someone else's.
<es>

@129
<en>{Ran}\n"Are you sure you didn't go anywhere else?"
<es>

@130
<en>She was even rummaging through the rubbish bin. Did I go anywhere else?
<es>

@131
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah, I went to the bathroom."
<es>

@134
<en>{Ran}\n"Let's go!!"
<es>

@136
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is the boys' bathroom."
<es>

@142
<en>{Ran}\n"Do you see it anywhere?"
<es>

@143
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, this is the boys' room..."
<es>

@144
<en>She didn't care.
<es>

@147
<en>{Ran}\n"Did you look under the sink?"
<es>

@148
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't get down on the floor near the toilets! It's filthy!"
<es>

@151
<en>{Ran}\n"A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do!"
<es>

@152
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let me look for it!\nJust wait for me outside."
<es>

@153
<en>I searched every corner, but I couldn't find it in the bathroom.
<es>

@156
<en>{Ran}\n"It wasn't there!? Then where else...?"
<es>

@157
<en>She looked like she was about to cry. It wasn't even her wallet.
<es>

@158
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't cry. I'll find it eventually."
<es>

@161
<en>{Ran}\n"You better!"
<es>

@162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will!"
<es>

@163
<en>It started to feel like I was looking for her wallet instead.
<es>

@168
<en>{Ran}\n"You came all the way out here during your lunch break?"
<es>

@169
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, but somebody might have thrown it out by mistake."
<es>

@170
<en>We headed to the incinerator. They'd already carried this afternoon's trash out here, and I thought it might have gotten mixed in.
<es>

@173
<en>{Ran}\n"Look at the smoke......"
<es>

@174
<en>Thin black trails of smoke rose from the incinerator. The fire was burning inside.
<es>

@177
<en>{Ran}\n"This is bad! If it's there, they'll burn it!"
<es>

@178
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll go and take a look!"
<es>

@180
<en>I ran towards the incinerator. Ran was right behind me.
<es>

@184
<en>I opened the heavy iron door. It looks like they'd just lit the flame.
<es>

@185
<en>{Ran}\n"Is it in there?!"
<es>

@186
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh...I-it is!"
<es>

@189
<en>{Ran}\n"Really?! Grab it!!"
<es>

@190
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But the fire... Owow!"
<es>

@193
<en>{Ran}\n"Argh! Where is it!!"
<es>

@194
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right there! Ah! It's on fire!"
<es>

@195
<en>{Ran}\n"Move!!"
<es>

@197
<en>*SHOVE*
<es>

@199
<en>Ran knocked me to the side, and stuck her arm into the fire without hesitating.
<es>

@200
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Watch out!"
<es>

@201
<en>She felt around in order to find it.
<es>

@204
<en>{Ran}\n"Got it!!"
<es>

@205
<en>She pulled her arm back.\nHer hand emerged from the fire with my wallet intact.
<es>

@210
<en>{Ran}\n"I-I-I got it!!"
<es>

@211
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's on fire!!"
<es>

@212
<en>My wallet was burning!!
<es>

@213
<en>{Ran}\n"Water! Water!"
<es>

@214
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait for me here!"
<es>

@215
<en>I found a fire safety bucket with water in it.
<es>

@216
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Go out!"
<es>

@219
<en>I poured the water right on Ran.
<es>

@220
<en>{Ran}\n"Wahff!"
<es>

@221
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's out..."
<es>

@222
<en>{Ran}\n"How about your money!?"
<es>

@223
<en>She checked my wallet before herself. She quickly smiled.
<es>

@226
<en>{Ran}\n"It's safe! Your money's alright!"
<es>

@227
<en>She showed me the happiest smile she had. She looked really cute with it.
<es>

@234
<en>{Ran}\n"I feel so much better now."
<es>

@235
<en>I asked her to change her clothes before going back to class as she was soaking wet.
<es>

@236
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks a ton - I owe you one.\nBut you shouldn't have done that - I don't want you to get hurt!"
<es>

@239
<en>{Ran}\n"But money is important."
<es>

@240
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, but..."
<es>

@241
<en>Would you go that far for it? Especially for someone else?
<es>

@244
<en>{Ran}\n"I didn't wanna see you go broke."
<es>

@245
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But why would you go so far?"
<es>

@246
<en>Ran went overboard today, and I really wanted to know why.
<es>

@249
<en>{Ran}\n"There was a time I lost my wallet once. In fourth grade, I think. While we were on vacation."
<es>

@250
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fourth grade? Then your parents were there, right?"
<es>

@251
<en>{Ran}\n"I'd strayed away from them. There was a festival that day. And in the crowd, you know?"
<es>

@252
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A festival? Yeah, I can see how that'd happen."
<es>

@253
<en>If they really got separated, it would've been hard to find each other. And being alone in that kind of crowd is frightening for a child.
<es>

@256
<en>{Ran}\n"I never felt so lonely in my entire life. No matter how hard I searched, I couldn't find them. I didn't know where they went, and there were people everywhere."
<es>

@257
<en>{Ran}\n"Even if I wanted to go back to the hotel, I didn't know how since we came by taxi. And I wasn't young enough to go crying to an adult for help either."
<es>

@260
<en>{Ran}\n"That's when I happened to find ten yen on the street. I used that to call my parents' cell phone. They were there in five minutes."
<es>

@261
<en>{Ran}\n"It was only ten yen. I was amazed at the power of money. And I chose to cherish money for the rest of my life."
<es>

@262
<en>She looked happy talking about her past.
<es>

@263
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So since that incident you've been obsessed with money?"
<es>

@266
<en>{Ran}\n"Yep."
<es>

@267
<en>Her reason wasn't as drastic as I'd expected. It must have been a major event to Ran at the time though, especially for it to influence her personality this much.
<es>

@270
<en>{Ran}\n"I didn't want you to have to go through what I did on that day."
<es>

@271
<en>She really was worrying about me. It felt kind of heart-warming, kind of nice to have her care about me.
<es>

@274
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, if you ever need a loan, just ask. I'll only charge 10% every 10 days."
<es>

@275
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's expensive!!"
<es>

@276
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahahahaha!"
<es>

@277
<en>I got to see an unexpected side of Ran today.
<es>
