@7
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't believe we actually got caught."
<es>

@8
<en>The guys were chasing a cat that snatched a fish from the cafeteria.
<es>

@12
<en>{Appo}\n"It turns out that we found some other animals."
<es>

@13
<en>I was shocked to see Appo in awe of us.
<es>

@14
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm so ashamed..."
<es>

@15
<en>I felt so embarrassed, getting caught by my friends.
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You moaned too loud, Ran."
<es>

@20
<en>I gave Ran a not-so-gentle nudge with my elbow.
<es>

@22
<en>{Ran}\n"It's impossible to hold that in!"
<es>

@23
<en>I don't think the guys saw anything because I was on top, but they did catch us fucking, and that was making her feel down.
<es>

@27
<en>{Appo}\n"You guys are lucky that it was just us. What if it was Yagami? He would have beaten the shit out of both of you. You've got to control yourself a bit, dude."
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right... Sorry..."
<es>

@33
<en>{Daigo}\n"You should've known better, Kazushi. It seems like you've been going overboard since you lost your virginity."
<es>

@34
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No... Come on! It's not like that..."
<es>

@38
<en>{Ran}\n"But you two got to see a nice show, so make sure you pay up!!"
<es>

@42
<en>{Appo}\n"All we saw was Kazushi's ass!"
<es>

@46
<en>{Ran}\n"It's 5000 yen for his butt!"
<es>

@47
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Come on..."
<es>

@52
<en>The next day.\nWe went shopping for the supplies needed for our gold refining experiments.
<es>

@53
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Man, this gate is huge for no reason."
<es>

@54
<en>At first I thought this gate was just a waste of space and money, but now I understood its significance.
<es>

@55
<en>This gate separates the two worlds of the island: inside the school and everywhere else.
<es>

@56
<en>This gate serves to keep those two worlds separate.
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......according to Mei-sensei."
<es>

@58
<en>Honestly, I still didn't get the whole picture.
<es>

@59
<en>However, I was beginning to feel like I was in a different world whenever I left the school, like it existed on its own plane of reality.
<es>

@60
<en>I always had an odd feeling as we passed through the gate.
<es>

@63
<en>{Ran}\n".................."
<es>

@64
<en>Like someone was watching me...
<es>

@65
<en>{Ran}\n *STARE*
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? I am being watched!"
<es>

@67
<en>It was Ran.
<es>

@68
<en>{Ran}\n"Whatcha thinking about?"
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nothing..."
<es>

@70
<en>{Ran}\n"Are you sure? Aren't you fantasizing about something erotic?"
<es>

@71
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That sounds like something an old man would say."
<es>

@72
<en>{Ran}\n"I know that all the boys your age think like that when they're out on their first date."
<es>

@73
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Out on a first date? This is a date? I thought we were just going shopping."
<es>

@76
<en>{Ran}\n"If a couple goes out together then it's a date, like a rose by any other name, be it shopping, going to the cinema, or checking the stock market."
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think it quite works like that."
<es>

@78
<en>So this is our first date?
<es>

@81
<en>{Ran}\n"So? What're you thinking about now? Are you thinking about how far you can go on our first date?"
<es>

@82
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? No. All you should do on a first date is hold each other's hands. That's what proper couples do, right?"
<es>

@85
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh? What? We aren't elementary school kids, so no."
<es>

@86
<en>{Ran}\n"Have you forgotten how far we've already gone in our relationship?"
<es>

@87
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, you could say that..."
<es>

@88
<en>But I still thought we should reflect upon what we were supposed to be doing on a first date.
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So..."
<es>

@90
<en>I grabbed one of the hands she was swinging next to me.
<es>

@93
<en>{Ran}\n"Ueh?"
<es>

@94
<en>Ran suddenly looked up at me after a strange cry.
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What was that cry? Don't make such strange sounds."
<es>

@98
<en>{Ran}\n"You're the one who touched me out of nowhere."
<es>

@99
<en>Ran flushed slightly as she argued.
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Are you blushing?"
<es>

@101
<en>{Ran}\n"But that kind of thing makes you blush. It's like it makes your heart flutter or..."
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, true."
<es>

@103
<en>I could feel her palm growing sweaty.
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"True."
<es>

@105
<en>I blushed too. Suddenly we were super-conscious of each other, which kept us nervous and quiet.
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why don't you stretch out your other arm? Like this."
<es>

@109
<en>{Ran}\n"Why? Like this?"
<es>

@110
<en>Both of us stretched our empty hands out to the side.
<es>

@111
<en>{Ran}\n"What's this?"
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is how big a golden eagle becomes when it stretches out its wings. Pretty big, huh?"
<es>

@115
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah. Really? Golden eagles are this big?"
<es>

@116
<en>Ran gave a short reply, and titled her head. I was so embarrassed, I tried to fill the silence with whatever I could.
<es>

@117
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We're acting just like junior high kids on their first date ever..."
<es>

@120
<en>{Ran}\n"Right? I'd die of embarrassment if someone we knew saw us acting so sweet. Seppuku man, seppuku."
<es>

@121
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. But I don't think anyone we know is around right now..."
<es>

@128
<en>{Sakura}\n".................."
<es>

@132
<en>{Rin}\n"..................Hey!"
<es>

@133
<en>...or I'm wrong again. Sakura and Fujisaki-san were right there!
<es>

@136
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh? Huh, you two on a date?"
<es>

@140
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahaha, k-kind of. You two?"
<es>

@144
<en>{Rin}\n"Just going for a stroll. You two are on a date? Good for you!!"
<es>

@145
<en>Fujisaki-san seemed really envious of us... Was she actually interested in romance and relationships?
<es>

@149
<en>{Sakura}\n"Believe it or not, Rin's a horny girl."
<es>

@150
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? She is?!"
<es>

@153
<en>{Rin}\n"Th-th-that's not true! Why are you saying that, Sakura!"
<es>

@154
<en>Fujisaki-san horny, huh? Hmm, I can't picture it. But that gap... is nice!
<es>

@159
<en>{Ran}\n"............"
<es>

@160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Woah?!"
<es>

@161
<en>Ran was staring at me.
<es>

@162
<en>{Ran}\n"You were dreaming about something perverted."
<es>

@163
<en>She knew.
<es>

@164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No-no way!!"
<es>

@165
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmph. I'll remember this later."
<es>

@166
<en>What's coming later? I'm scared...
<es>

@172
<en>{Rin}\n"What are you two talking about?"
<es>

@173
<en>{Sakura}\n"Are we bothering you on your date? Ahaha."
<es>

@177
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, no, it's nothing. Kazushi was just raping Rin in his imagination. We're really sorry."
<es>

@181
<en>{Rin}\n"Huh? Haruma-kun, you imagined?"
<es>

@182
<en>{Kazushi}\n"N-no, no! I'd never!"
<es>

@183
<en>Bloody hell, that's not funny!
<es>

@187
<en>{Sakura}\n"What are you two heading out to do? You're not planning to go have sex in the early afternoon, are you?"
<es>

@188
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Uh, no. We did it yesterday so I can still hold off for today..."
<es>

@192
<en>{Ran}\n"Idiot!"
<es>

@198
<en>Ran slapped me hard on the back of my head.
<es>

@202
<en>{Rin}\n"Stars are coming out of his eyes..."
<es>

@203
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ow. Ran, you hit way too hard. Not on the back of the head."
<es>

@206
<en>{Ran}\n"It's because you acted like an idiot!"
<es>

@210
<en>{Sakura}\n"Haha. You two get along really well, huh? Honestly I was surprised to see you two going out, but it seems like things are working out really well between you."
<es>

@211
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That conversation just now made you think things are going well?"
<es>

@215
<en>{Rin}\n"It did. You're both so radiant, I can hardly watch."
<es>

@218
<en>{Sakura}\n"Because you imagine them having sex, right?"
<es>

@221
<en>{Rin}\n"No I don't! Jeez, Sakura!"
<es>

@222
<en>Rin kept fighting back against Sakura's jokes. Fujisaki-san really was cute.
<es>

@227
<en>{Ran}\n"........................"
<es>

@228
<en>Whoah?! She's glaring at me again!
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I wasn't thinking of anything perverted."
<es>

@230
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm not saying anything yet."
<es>

@236
<en>{Rin}\n"Hey, Sakura, wait!!"
<es>

@237
<en>{Sakura}\n"Ahaha, Rin's getting out of control, so we'll be going."
<es>

@241
<en>Sakura ran away, waving at us as she goes.
<es>

@245
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, okay! Later!"
<es>

@246
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, later! You too, Fujisaki-san!"
<es>

@250
<en>{Rin}\n"Yes, see you later. Hey, wait up, Sakura!"
<es>

@255
<en>The noisy girls were gone after running over the curve.
<es>

@258
<en>{Ran}\n"How long you gonna stare after them?"
<es>

@260
<en>*Tug*
<es>

@261
<en>Ran pinched me on the side.
<es>

@262
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OW! What are you doing? That hurts!"
<es>

@265
<en>{Ran}\n"That's what you get for eye-raping Rin!"
<es>

@266
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? What stupid crap are you saying? I wasn't eye-raping anyone."
<es>

@269
<en>{Ran}\n"I know that boys love girls like Rin. Yeah, I like her too. It'd be great if every family had a girl like her..."
<es>

@272
<en>{Ran}\n"But that's not it!"
<es>

@273
<en>Hmm? You look confused. Wait a minute... Are you...?
<es>

@274
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you jealous?"
<es>

@275
<en>Ran stared at me hard.
<es>

@278
<en>{Ran}\n"Uh... You may be right."
<es>

@279
<en>Ran admitted it and gave me a sad look. It was one of dejection... like a deflated balloon.
<es>

@280
<en>Or like a hurt bitch.
<es>

@281
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, I'm just kidding. Don't worry about it."
<es>

@282
<en>{Ran}\n"This is my first time going out with a boy, and sometimes I don't know how to control my emotions. I was acting out of line, wasn't I?"
<es>

@283
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, not that bad."
<es>

@284
<en>{Ran}\n"I hate women's jealousy."
<es>

@285
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, once in a while's not so bad."
<es>

@286
<en>Ran had always been a good sport with me, so it was refreshing to see the other side of her sometimes.
<es>

@287
<en>If this is as bad as it gets, I don't mind her being jealous.
<es>

@290
<en>{Ran}\n"Really? OK, then sometimes I'll act jealous for you. That'll be 500 yen."
<es>

@291
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That is not attractive."
<es>

@292
<en>Ran was cute - as long as she wasn't talking about money.
<es>

@296
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, right, this store..."
<es>

@297
<en>It's the general store we came to with everyone. They had everything from alchemic goods to daily commodities all in one place.
<es>

@300
<en>{Ran}\n"Hello! Is my order ready?"
<es>

@301
<en>Ran called out to the owner with a propitious voice and a familiar man came up from out back.
<es>

@306
<en>{Miya}\n"Welcome, Ran-chan. I've got everything ready. ...huh? You are..."
<es>

@307
<en>Miya-san looked a bit surprised to see me with Ran.
<es>

@308
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruma. Thanks for last time."
<es>

@309
<en>{Miya}\n"Oh, you were there too? Are you here together?"
<es>

@312
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes... I don't like hanging out in a big group."
<es>

@315
<en>{Miya}\n"And yet you brought Haruma-kun with you. Mhmm..."
<es>

@316
<en>Miya-san looked at us both and smiled suggestively.
<es>

@317
<en>{Miya}\n"I see, I see. So you two are like that now?"
<es>

@320
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, that's how it is. So give us a bunch of extras in celebration."
<es>

@321
<en>{Miya}\n"I see, I see. In that case, I guess I have to give you a discount."
<es>

@322
<en>It was just like her to use our relationship to haggle down prices, I was surprised Miya agreed so easily.
<es>

@325
<en>{Miya}\n"Ran-chan's a very clever girl. You caught yourself a pretty good one, didn't you?"
<es>

@326
<en>A pretty good one...?
<es>

@329
<en>{Ran}\n"Our meeting was destiny. I barely had to do anything, but he came like a moth to flames."
<es>

@330
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, hey..."
<es>

@331
<en>{Miya}\n"The boys have only been here a short time and things are changing. Are there a lot of other girls with boyfriends now?"
<es>

@334
<en>{Ran}\n"Quite a few. They're all young and kinda cutting loose during summer break. I bet most of them will break up once classes start again."
<es>

@335
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why does that sound like you're talking about us..."
<es>

@338
<en>{Ran}\n"No! We'll be fine. It's because we've got a very strong bond between us."
<es>

@339
<en>Is that bond the million yen? I'd rather she quit calling it a bond and give it back ASAP.
<es>

@340
<en>My dad may have found out about his bike by now...\nI'm petrified just thinking about it.
<es>

@343
<en>{Miya}\n"A strong bond, huh? Well, how lovely."
<es>

@346
<en>{Ran}\n"If you think it's lovely, then give us a lovely deal."
<es>

@347
<en>{Miya}\n"Ahaha, I can't fight you, Ran-chan..."
<es>

@348
<en>Miya-san broke out his calculator and started tapping away. Ran peered over his shoulder, and started negotiating. In the end, Miya-san folded.
<es>

@351
<en>{Ran}\n"Thank you, come again!"
<es>

@352
<en>{Miya}\n"I don't profit with you as a customer."
<es>

@353
<en>Miya-san smiled bitterly, which meant he really wasn't making a profit. To top it off, Ran bought a ton of stuff.
<es>

@357
<en>{Ran}\n"Here, carry it."
<es>

@358
<en>Ran made me carry a big hempen bag. It was pretty heavy.
<es>

@359
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is in the bag?"
<es>

@360
<en>{Ran}\n"I'll tell you later. Now let's go eat - I'm starving."
<es>

@363
<en>{Ran}\n"Today I'll treat you."
<es>

@367
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!?"
<es>

@370
<en>{Miya}\n"You are?"
<es>

@371
<en>The world went silent. Time stopped.
<es>

@377
<en>{Ran}\n"What've you two gone all shocked for?"
<es>

@378
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh... Because..."
<es>

@379
<en>{Miya}\n"This is the first time I've ever heard you offering to buy something for someone."
<es>

@382
<en>{Ran}\n"Of course I offer to treat people sometimes. I'm not stingy, just very selective."
<es>

@383
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@386
<en>{Ran}\n"So, Miya-san, I'll take this."
<es>

@387
<en>{Miya}\n"Huh? This is for your lunch?"
<es>

@391
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're treating me to this...?"
<es>

@392
<en>There was a steaming hot cup of instant ramen in my hands.
<es>

@395
<en>{Ran}\n"Even cup ramen tastes delicious when you're enjoying the view from up here, so stop complaining and eat!"
<es>

@396
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay..."
<es>

@397
<en>I began to gobble up the noodles.
<es>

@399
<en>*SLURRRRRRPPPPP*
<es>

@400
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ohhhh!!"
<es>

@401
<en>Damn, it does taste good.
<es>

@402
<en>{Ran}\n"What do you think? Good, right?"
<es>

@403
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes! This tastes great! But this great view is half the reason."
<es>

@404
<en>It was like how a school lunch tastes better when you're on a field trip. Ran grinned at me.
<es>

@407
<en>{Ran}\n"So what, it's good, right? Or would you rather have me make you a bentou? You want to take that risk?"
<es>

@408
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you saying you can't cook?"
<es>

@409
<en>{Ran}\n"Who knows? You'll find out sooner or later."
<es>

@410
<en>Ran gave me a mischievous smile. She always loathed giving out information, probably because she thought it was worth money.
<es>

@411
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You bought a lot of groceries back there. Aren't you gonna cook something with them?"
<es>

@412
<en>Half the stuff in her bag were groceries. Sure, there was a lot of cup noodles and instant food, but there was plenty of rice, meat, and vegetables too.
<es>

@415
<en>{Ran}\n"It'd be nice if we could get by on just instant food every meal, but you'd get sick of that. We don't know how many days it'll take either."
<es>

@416
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about?"
<es>

@417
<en>{Ran}\n"Making gold, of course. We don't know how many days the refinement will take, and the important part is temperature control so we have to stay by it."
<es>

@418
<en>{Ran}\n"So starting tomorrow, we'll be living in the lab building."
<es>

@419
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Living there? Will it take that long to refine?"
<es>

@422
<en>{Ran}\n"Of course. What we're trying to do is to invent the secret elixir to change lead into gold."
<es>

@423
<en>{Ran}\n"If it was easy to do, then the world would be flooded in gold by now."
<es>

@424
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That makes sense."
<es>

@425
<en>From what I'd heard, there were very few alchemists who successfully created gold.
<es>

@426
<en>Hardly any have even come close.
<es>

@427
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can we really do it, just the two of us?"
<es>

@428
<en>Furthermore, Ran had such little talent for alchemy that she admitted it herself. I was just a clueless newb.
<es>

@429
<en>As the failure combo, shouldn't we lower our goal a little bit? The first important part is getting Ran to successfully conduct an experiment.
<es>

@432
<en>{Ran}\n"What's important is be a challenger. The higher our goal, the harder we try."
<es>

@433
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, that's true."
<es>

@434
<en>Without money motivating her, Ran wouldn't even make an attempt.
<es>

@437
<en>{Ran}\n"It might be absolutely impossible if we do anything normal, so today I'm going to challenge something new."
<es>

@438
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Something new? Do you have some kind of a secret plan?"
<es>

@439
<en>{Ran}\n"Watch me. If I can create gold, I'll even give you a little!"
