@7
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They really found us."
<es>

@8
<en>The guys were chasing a cat that snatched a fish from the cafeteria.
<es>

@12
<en>{Appo-}\n"It turns out that we found different animals."
<es>

@13
<en>I had no words to say.
<es>

@14
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't know what to say..."
<es>

@15
<en>I feel so embarrassed.
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You moaned so loud, Ran."
<es>

@20
<en>I give Ran a nudge with my elbow.
<es>

@22
<en>{Ran}\n"I couldn't help it!"
<es>

@23
<en>I don't think the guys saw her private part because I was on top. But she seems to feel down because basically they saw us doing it.
<es>

@27
<en>{Appo-}\n"You guys are lucky because it was us. What if it was Mr.Yagami? He would knock both of you out. Control yourself a bit, dude."
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right...Sorry..."
<es>

@33
<en>{Daigo}\n"You should have known better, Kazushi. It seems you have been going overboard since you lost virginity."
<es>

@34
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No...Come on! Not like that..."
<es>

@38
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, guys! You two owe us money for seeing it!"
<es>

@42
<en>{Appo-}\n"All we saw was Kazushi's butt! That's it!"
<es>

@46
<en>{Ran}\n"It's 5.000 yen for his butt!!"
<es>

@47
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Come on..."
<es>

@52
<en>Next day. We went shopping for the things needed for the experiment with gold refinement.
<es>

@53
<en>{Kazushi}\n"God, this gate is huge."
<es>

@54
<en>At first I thought this gate was just a waste of space and money. But now I know the significance of this gate.
<es>

@55
<en>This gate is separating our world - - inside and outside.
<es>

@56
<en>The gate serves as the device dividing the world between inside and outside.
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n".....according to Ms. Ibuki."
<es>

@58
<en>Honestly, I still don't get the whole picture.
<es>

@59
<en>However, I am beginning to feel that I find myself in a different world whenever I go to school. The school creates another world.
<es>

@60
<en>We get through the gate, which gives me a unique feeling.
<es>

@63
<en>{Ran}\n".................."
<es>

@64
<en>Like someone is watching me...
<es>

@65
<en>{Ran}\n"Ran stares..."
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@67
<en>Someone WAS watching me. It was Ran...
<es>

@68
<en>{Ran}\n"What are you thinking?"
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nothing..."
<es>

@70
<en>{Ran}\n"Are you sure? Aren't you fantasizing about something erotic?"
<es>

@71
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't treat me like I am some kind of sex lunatic or something."
<es>

@72
<en>{Ran}\n"I know all the boys at your age think about the same thing when they go on a first date."
<es>

@73
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Going on a first date? I thought this is just shopping."
<es>

@76
<en>{Ran}\n"When the couple goes out together, it's still a date - - whatever they do like shopping, going to the movies, or checking the stock market."
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The last one may be a popular option."
<es>

@78
<en>So this is our first date?
<es>

@81
<en>{Ran}\n"What? What are you thinking now? You are thinking how far you can go on our first date?"
<es>

@82
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm? No. On the first date all you do is just hold each other's hands. That's what the couples do. Right?"
<es>

@85
<en>{Ran}\n"Wrong! We are not elementary school kids."
<es>

@86
<en>{Ran}\n"Besides, we have already gone pretty far in our relationship."
<es>

@87
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, you can say that."
<es>

@88
<en>But I think we should still act upon what we are supposed to be doing on the first date.
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, here is what I do..."
<es>

@90
<en>I grab one of her hands that are swinging next to me.
<es>

@93
<en>{Ran}\n"Heh!"
<es>

@94
<en>Ran grunts all of a sudden.
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What that hell was that voice? Don't grunt like that."
<es>

@98
<en>{Ran}\n"You are the one that touched me suddenly!"
<es>

@99
<en>Flushing slightly, Ran argues.
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Are you blushed?"
<es>

@101
<en>{Ran}\n"Because I'm not used to things like that in public and it also tickled."
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see."
<es>

@103
<en>I feel sweaty on her palm.
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She is really burning with embarrassment."
<es>

@105
<en>I, too, blushed. Suddenly, we are super-conscious of each other, which keeps us nervous and quiet.
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why don't you stretch the other arm out sideways?"
<es>

@109
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmm? Like this?"
<es>

@110
<en>Both of us stretch our empty hands out sideways.
<es>

@111
<en>{Ran}\n"What is this?"
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"When a golden eagle stretches out its wings, it will become as big as this. Quite big, right?"
<es>

@115
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah. Really? Golden eagles are this big?"
<es>

@116
<en>Then ,Ran gets back to silence. We feel so awkward that I bring whatever the topics that come to my mind.
<es>

@117
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We act like junior high kids on the first date."
<es>

@120
<en>{Ran}\n"Right? Why are we so conscious of each other? I don't want anyone to see me so nervous like this. Because it is embarrassing."
<es>

@121
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. But I don't think there is anyone we know here at this time..."
<es>

@128
<en>{Sakura}\n".................."
<es>

@132
<en>{Rin}\n"..................Hey!"
<es>

@133
<en>......which was proved wrong right away. Sakura and Rin are right there!
<es>

@136
<en>{Sakura}\n"You guys on a date?"
<es>

@140
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah. Sort of. What about you guys?"
<es>

@144
<en>{Rin}\n"We are just strolling. You two going on a date? Good for you!!"
<es>

@145
<en>Rin seems really envious of us. Is Rin interested in romantic relationships?
<es>

@149
<en>{Sakura}\n"Rin is a pretty sensual girl."
<es>

@150
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah!?"
<es>

@153
<en>{Rin}\n"Hey, Sakura!! What are you talking about?"
<es>

@154
<en>Rin is interested in sex...? It's not my image of her. And yet, that image gap is rather good!!
<es>

@159
<en>{Ran}\n"............"
<es>

@160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!!"
<es>

@161
<en>Ran was staring at me.
<es>

@162
<en>{Ran}\n"You were fantasizing about something nasty."
<es>

@163
<en>She knows.
<es>

@164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No-No way!!"
<es>

@165
<en>{Ran}\n"You will be sorry...."
<es>

@166
<en>Am I? She is scary...
<es>

@172
<en>{Rin}\n"What are you two talking about?"
<es>

@173
<en>{Sakura}\n"Are we bothering you on a date?"
<es>

@177
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, no...It's just Kazushi - - he was fantasizing about Rin's nudity. Sorry."
<es>

@181
<en>{Rin}\n"What? My nudity?"
<es>

@182
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No!! Never!!"
<es>

@183
<en>Gee...It's not funny.
<es>

@187
<en>{Sakura}\n"How about you guys? Are you guys gonna make out this early afternoon?"
<es>

@188
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I mean...we did it yesterday...so...today is... too early...you know..."
<es>

@192
<en>{Ran}\n"Shut up!!"
<es>

@198
<en>Ran slaps me on the back of my head.
<es>

@202
<en>{Rin}\n"I'm seeing starts....many starts..."
<es>

@203
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Ran. It hurts! Easy!"
<es>

@206
<en>{Ran}\n"You don't have to tell them everything about us, idiot!"
<es>

@210
<en>{Sakura}\n"Haha. You two are really getting along well, huh? Honestly, I was surprised to see you two go out, but it seems things are working out between you."
<es>

@211
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What part of our conversation exactly made you think we are getting along well?"
<es>

@215
<en>{Rin}\n"Just everything. In fact, it is hard to see you together because you guys are too bright to see."
<es>

@218
<en>{Sakura}\n"Well, what she meant was she easily imagines you two fucking each other."
<es>

@221
<en>{Rin}\n"No! Sakura!!"
<es>

@222
<en>Rin keeps hitting Sakura jokingly. Well, Rin is very cute.
<es>

@227
<en>{Ran}\n"........................"
<es>

@228
<en>Hmm? Ran is staring me again.
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I was not thinking of anything nasty."
<es>

@230
<en>{Ran}\n"I am not saying anything quite yet."
<es>

@236
<en>{Rin}\n"Hey, Sakura, wait!!"
<es>

@237
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hahaha. Rin is going out of control. So I'm leaving. See you guys later."
<es>

@241
<en>Sakura is running away, waving at us.
<es>

@245
<en>{Ran}\n"Catch you guys later!"
<es>

@246
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See you, Sakura! And later on, Rin."
<es>

@250
<en>{Rin}\n"See you...hey Sakura, wait up!"
<es>

@255
<en>The noisy girls are gone after running over the curve.
<es>

@258
<en>{Ran}\n"What do you keep looking at?"
<es>

@260
<en>Ouch!
<es>

@261
<en>Ran pinches me in the side.
<es>

@262
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?! That was hurt!"
<es>

@265
<en>{Ran}\n"You keep leering at Rin!"
<es>

@266
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What are you talking about? I am not leering at her!"
<es>

@269
<en>{Ran}\n"I know boys love girls like Rin. Actually, I like her too. It'd be great to have one like her in each family."
<es>

@272
<en>{Ran}\n"What that hell am I talking about?"
<es>

@273
<en>Hmm? You look confused. Wait a minute...Are you...?
<es>

@274
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you jealous?"
<es>

@275
<en>Ran stares at me hard.
<es>

@278
<en>{Ran}\n"Uh...you may be right."
<es>

@279
<en>Ran admitted it and gave me a sad look. She looks dejected...like a deflated balloon.
<es>

@280
<en>Or like a wimpy dog.
<es>

@281
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Just kidding."
<es>

@282
<en>{Ran}\n"This is the first time I have ever gone out with a boy. So I sometime don't know how to control my emotions. I acted pretty bitchy, didn't I?"
<es>

@283
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A little bit..."
<es>

@284
<en>{Ran}\n"I hate to be jealous and I think women's jealousy is terrible."
<es>

@285
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I can handle it if you have it sometimes."
<es>

@286
<en>Ran is always a good sport. So it's refreshing sometimes to see the other side of her.
<es>

@287
<en>I don't feel bad even if you feel jealous.
<es>

@290
<en>{Ran}\n"Really? Okay, I will get jealous sometimes for you then. So give me 500 yen."
<es>

@291
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That is ugly."
<es>

@292
<en>She is cute - - as long as she stays away from money talk.
<es>

@296
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It must be this store."
<es>

@297
<en>They sell a variety of goods including daily commodities and alchemy things.
<es>

@300
<en>{Ran}\n"Hello! Things I ordered are ready?"
<es>

@301
<en>An owner of the store comes out.
<es>

@306
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Hello! Yes, they are ready. And you are..."
<es>

@307
<en>Mr.Miya looks a bit surprised to see me with Ran.
<es>

@308
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Kazushi. I'm Kazushi Haruma."
<es>

@309
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"You two shopping together, huh?"
<es>

@312
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes... I don't like hanging out in a big group."
<es>

@315
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"But you hang out with Kazushi...So does that mean...?"
<es>

@316
<en>Mr.Miya smiles at us suggestively.
<es>

@317
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Oh, you two are now going out, huh?"
<es>

@320
<en>{Ran}\n"That's right. So make us happy by giving a lot of discounts, will you?"
<es>

@321
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Okay. Okay. I will give you a discount."
<es>

@322
<en>It's just like her to try to haggle over prices. But it's stunning to see Mr.Miya give in like that.
<es>

@325
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Being a practical girl, Ran, you got yourself a practical boy."
<es>

@326
<en>A practical boy...?
<es>

@329
<en>{Ran}\n"We are meant to be together. I didn't do anything. It is like a bug struck in the spider web, so to speak."
<es>

@330
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A bad metaphor..."
<es>

@331
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"It seems things are going differently among you guys. Are there any other girls going out with boys?"
<es>

@334
<en>{Ran}\n"Quite a few. They are all young and kind of cutting loose during the summer. After the summer is over, I guess many of them will break up."
<es>

@335
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you talking about us too?"
<es>

@338
<en>{Ran}\n"No! We are fine. It's because we have a very strong bond between us."
<es>

@339
<en>Is that bond one million yen? I'd rather want the money back as soon as possible.
<es>

@340
<en>My Dad may have found it by now...It's pretty scary to even think about it.
<es>

@343
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"A strong bond, huh? Sounds like you two are a happy couple."
<es>

@346
<en>{Ran}\n"That's right! So don't forget to give me a lot of discounts. This way you can celebrate the happy couple."
<es>

@347
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I cannot beat you, Ran..."
<es>

@348
<en>The price negotiation started. After all, as expected, Mr.Miya gave way.
<es>

@351
<en>{Ran}\n"Thanks very much!!"
<es>

@352
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I don't make any profit if I do business with you, Ran."
<es>

@353
<en>Mr.Miya smiles bitterly, which means he is not really making any profit. Besides, Ran bought tons of things.
<es>

@357
<en>{Ran}\n"You carry this."
<es>

@358
<en>Ran tells me to carry a heavy bag.
<es>

@359
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is in this bag?"
<es>

@360
<en>{Ran}\n"I will tell you later. Let's go eat. I'm so hungry now."
<es>

@363
<en>{Ran}\n"Let me buy you dinner."
<es>

@367
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?!!"
<es>

@370
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"You buying me dinner?"
<es>

@371
<en>All the sounds are gone from this world. Time just stopped.
<es>

@377
<en>{Ran}\n"What do you guys go numb for?"
<es>

@378
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahh...Because..."
<es>

@379
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"This is the first time I have ever heard you saying to buy something for somebody."
<es>

@382
<en>{Ran}\n"Of course, I treat people sometimes. I am not stingy. I am just selective."
<es>

@383
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, really?"
<es>

@386
<en>{Ran}\n"Give me this, Mr.Miya."
<es>

@387
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"What? Is this our lunch?"
<es>

@391
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Buying me this...?"
<es>

@392
<en>Ran puts me a cup of instant noodles in my hand.
<es>

@395
<en>{Ran}\n"Even the noodles taste delicious while enojoying this view from here. So stop complaining and eat!"
<es>

@396
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay..."
<es>

@397
<en>I begin to gobble up the noodles.
<es>

@399
<en>He makes sounds by sucking the noodles.
<es>

@400
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ohhhh!!"
<es>

@401
<en>It tastes damn so good!
<es>

@402
<en>{Ran}\n"What do you think? Good right?"
<es>

@403
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes! This tastes great! But this great view contributes to that too, I'd say."
<es>

@404
<en>This is like...the lunch during the field trip tastes better. Ran grins.
<es>

@407
<en>{Ran}\n"You can say that. But what is Important is you enjoy the food you eat, right? Or do you want me to make dinner? Would you want to take a risk?"
<es>

@408
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait! Are you saying you cannot cook?"
<es>

@409
<en>{Ran}\n"I won't say. You will find out sooner or later."
<es>

@410
<en>Ran gives me a mischievous smile. She always keeps something a secret. She may be thinking secrets can be worth some money.
<es>

@411
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You bought a lot of groceries back there. Aren't you gonna cook something with them?"
<es>

@412
<en>Half of the stuff purchased are groceries such as rice, meat, vegetables, and so on.
<es>

@415
<en>{Ran}\n"You will get tired of instant food if you eat the stuff every day. Plus, I don't even know how long it will last."
<es>

@416
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about?"
<es>

@417
<en>{Ran}\n"I am talking about our experiment with gold refinement! That may take long time to complete. It will definitely cost a lot of attention and work, you know."
<es>

@418
<en>{Ran}\n"Starting tomorrow, we will stay overnight in the lab building."
<es>

@419
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Staying overnight? Will it take that long?"
<es>

@422
<en>{Ran}\n"Of course. What we are trying to do is to invent the secret elixir to change lead into gold."
<es>

@423
<en>{Ran}\n"That mission is very difficult. Because if this is easy, this world is full of gold by now."
<es>

@424
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That makes sense."
<es>

@425
<en>There are very few alchemists that made it successful to make gold.
<es>

@426
<en>Only a few could make it so far.
<es>

@427
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can we really do it, only us?"
<es>

@428
<en>Besides, Ran has no talent for alchemy and I know nothing about it.
<es>

@429
<en>So it can be more realistic to make our goal rather reachable. The first thing to do is for Ran to succeed in experiments.
<es>

@432
<en>{Ran}\n"What is Important is to have a challenge spirit. Higher our goal is, harder we try."
<es>

@433
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see. And I like that."
<es>

@434
<en>Making money can be a big motivation for her.
<es>

@437
<en>{Ran}\n"I know nothing ordinary will work. So I am going to try something new."
<es>

@438
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Something new? Do you have some kind of a secret plan?"
<es>

@439
<en>{Ran}\n"Watch me. If I make gold, I will give you a little."
<es>

@440
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Only a little?"
<es>

@441
<en>Not dividing it fifty-fifty? It seems Ran looks confident in her plan. What is she up to? I'm a little worried...
<es>
