@7
<en>Our summer had nearly passed away. There were only a few more days before out hot summer came to an end.
<es>

@9
<en>{Mei}\n"The breeze feels so good."
<es>

@10
<en>Mei seemed to be getting more and more beautiful lately. She was nearly perfect.
<es>

@11
<en>She doesn't have to become that beautiful. All I want is for her to be with me forever and ever, that's all.
<es>

@12
<en>However, as she gets more beautiful, she keeps intriguing me even more.
<es>

@13
<en>{Mei}\n"The sky is beautiful, isn't it?"
<es>

@14
<en>Mei was the one that's beautiful. Her eyes were like beautiful lakes, and the sky reflected in them was several times more beautiful than the real sky above me.
<es>

@15
<en>Maybe she was seeing this world a lot more beautifully than we do. Sometimes I couldn't help thinking that way.
<es>

@16
<en>I even felt like her gaze was making the world beautiful. Perhaps whether something is beautiful or tainted is determined by the heart of the beholder.
<es>

@17
<en>Mei's heart was certainly exceptionally beautiful. She was the greatest work God had created.
<es>

@18
<en>It was almost like the deep, rich flow of time was polishing the ore that was Mei into a beautiful gem.
<es>

@19
<en>{Mei}\n"Your hand."
<es>

@20
<en>The next thing I knew, her slender white hand was being held out to me. I took her hand and gently held it back.
<es>

@21
<en>{Mei}\n"Hee-hee."
<es>

@22
<en>Her small hand was entwined with mine. That innocent strength pulled me around behind her.
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You'll fall if you run like that."
<es>

@24
<en>{Mei}\n"Then we'll be together when we do."
<es>

@25
<en>I felt like she was becoming more and more transparent as the days went by. She was so precious, and yet it was so heart-rending.
<es>

@26
<en>We both knew these days wouldn't continue on for much longer.
<es>

@31
<en>This was one of Mei's favorite places. By the time we'd had several dates, the place was filled with a carpet of white flowers.
<es>

@32
<en>I loved looking up at her as I lay my head down on her lap in the middle of that field filled with the white flowers.
<es>

@33
<en>{Kazushi}\n"....................."
<es>

@34
<en>{Mei}\n"What?"
<es>

@35
<en>She noticed my glance and asked me.
<es>

@36
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I was just looking at you."
<es>

@37
<en>{Mei}\n"You're silly. Why don't you ever fall asleep? I'm letting you use my lap."
<es>

@38
<en>She always seemed to complain about that. But it wasn't my fault - she was too beautiful for me to take my eyes off of her.
<es>

@39
<en>I also felt like she might disappear the moment I looked away since she became more transparent every day.
<es>

@40
<en>{Mei}\n"What are you thinking about?"
<es>

@41
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm, tonight's dinner."
<es>

@42
<en>{Mei}\n"Ah, same as me, then."
<es>

@43
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? You were really thinking about dinner?"
<es>

@44
<en>{Mei}\n"What do you mean? Did you lie about thinking about dinner?"
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no. I feel like curry tonight."
<es>

@46
<en>{Mei}\n"Maybe curry with pork cutlet."
<es>

@47
<en>Mei sure ate well as usual. Maybe eating was keeping her in this world still.\n......Heh, how nice that'd be.
<es>

@48
<en>If that was the case, I would feed her a lot every single day and keep her here with me forever.
<es>

@49
<en>{Mei}\n"Tears......"
<es>

@50
<en>Mei wiped the corner of my eye. Her finger tip was wet.
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sleepy."
<es>

@52
<en>{Mei}\n"Then why don't you fall asleep?"
<es>

@53
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Kind of dozing off feels good."
<es>

@54
<en>I closed my eyes, but I wasn't really sleepy.
<es>

@55
<en>I only closed my eyes because it felt so nice and fluffy on Mei's lap. I really was just nodding off.
<es>

@56
<en>{Mei}\n"Hee-hee..."
<es>

@57
<en>Even with my eyes closed, I could tell Mei was looking down on me with a smile.\nI wonder if she thinks I'm really asleep.
<es>

@58
<en>{Mei}\n"I think I was born to fall in love."
<es>

@59
<en>She whispered to no one in particular. I felt a special meaning behind those words and opened my eyes. Just as I thought, she was looking down on me with a smile.
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did you remember something?"
<es>

@61
<en>Did she remember something about herself? I don't know why, but I just felt that way.
<es>

@62
<en>{Mei}\n"Once upon a time, there were two lovers who often came to this spot on a date."
<es>

@63
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh-huh?"
<es>

@64
<en>It didn't seem like it had anything to do with us. I didn't know what she was talking about, so I continued to listen.
<es>

@65
<en>{Mei}\n"The two of them got along well and loved each other very much. Anyone who saw them could easily tell it was so. 'A human's 'love' is a very beautiful emotion,' she thought."
<es>

@66
<en>That last line sounded like it was Mei's own opinion, but this was supposed to be a fairy tale.
<es>

@67
<en>I couldn't see where Mei was going with this yet.
<es>

@68
<en>{Mei}\n"'I want to know this beautiful emotion. I want to experience it,' she thought."
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You did?"
<es>

@70
<en>{Mei}\n"Who knows? ...I wonder who she is?"
<es>

@71
<en>She giggled. Well, I guess it doesn't matter. Maybe it's one of those made up stories.
<es>

@72
<en>Mei continued.
<es>

@73
<en>{Mei}\n"After that, a lot of things happened. She witnessed suffering and hardship. But still, her admiration towards the feeling of 'love' only grew stronger."
<es>

@74
<en>{Mei}\n"Many days and many months passed, then finally her chance came. It was her chance to experience 'love'."
<es>

@75
<en>{Mei}\n"And the one who gave her that chance, the one who led her to admire love, was herself."
<es>

@76
<en>Mei paused there and smiled.
<es>

@77
<en>{Mei}\n"That's how the fairy tale goes."
<es>

@78
<en>That was the ending.
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see, it's just a fairy tale."
<es>

@80
<en>{Mei}\n"Yep, just a fairy tale. I looked into lots of them."
<es>

@81
<en>I really wasn't interested in finding out if what she was telling was merely a fairy tale or if it was suggesting some kind of truth.
<es>

@82
<en>But every single word that came from Mei was more precious to me than anything else. I wasn't going to miss even a single word from her.
<es>

@83
<en>So I always listened to her very carefully.
<es>

@84
<en>{Mei}\n"Then she fell in love."
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see. Then did she find out what it's like to be in love?"
<es>

@86
<en>That's what Mei wanted to know. That's what I promised her I would let her experience.
<es>

@87
<en>Mei thought for a moment and then smiled mischievously.
<es>

@89
<en>{Mei}\n"It's a secret."
<es>

@90
<en>Her radiant smile almost made me cry. So, Mei's prediction was right.
<es>

@91
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@92
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes. Thank you."
<es>

@94
<en>She brought her face close and over mine, gently pecking me on my lips. They barely touched, but it was incredible kiss.
<es>

@95
<en>I probably will never feel such an impressionable kiss ever again in my life.
<es>

@97
<en>{Mei}\n"Can I ask you one final favor?"
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course."
<es>

@99
<en>I gave her an immediate reply. I will do whatever she wants me to do right now.
<es>

@100
<en>{Mei}\n"I wasn't really Ibuki Mei-san, was I?"
<es>

@101
<en>Mei was never Ibuki Mei-san. She was an artificial existence, made to look like Ibuki Mei.
<es>

@102
<en>The experiment to revive Ibuki Mei ended in failure, and gave birth to Mei.
<es>

@103
<en>{Mei}\n"I've already grown used to it, but isn't it a little strange to give someone else's name when naming yourself? So, I want a new name."
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A new name?"
<es>

@105
<en>I had no idea that her favor was something that humble.
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You want me to name you?"
<es>

@107
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, I want you to name me, Kazushi-kun."
<es>

@108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see. Then I'll have to give you a good name."
<es>

@109
<en>What would be good? It's hard to come up with something nice all of a sudden.
<es>

@110
<en>Shouldn't I really look into things like stroke counts and stuff?
<es>

@111
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can that be homework?"
<es>

@112
<en>{Mei}\n"No. I want it now, because..."
<es>

@113
<en>She started to say something and stopped, but I knew what she was going to say. She might not have another chance.
<es>

@114
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay, then I need to give you one now, huh?"
<es>

@115
<en>I thought seriously. What would be a good name for Mei?
<es>

@116
<en>{Mei}\n"I wonder what you will come up with?"
<es>

@117
<en>She looked at me with such anticipation I felt pressured.
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, first off, the last name can be Haruma, right?"
<es>

@119
<en>{Mei}\n"What? That's cutting corners!!"
<es>

@120
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We'll have the same last name eventually, so why not?"
<es>

@121
<en>{Mei}\n"That's kind of high-handed. Oh, well. Then my first name?"
<es>

@122
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Your first name, let's see..."
<es>

@123
<en>The first name is the challenge. Right now, it's Mei.........
<es>

@124
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I know!"
<es>

@125
<en>I came up with something. I told it to Mei.
<es>

@126
<en>{Mei}\n"Ok, I like that!"
<es>

@127
<en>Mei nodded as if she really liked it. Then she repeated the name many times to herself, savoring it.
<es>

@128
<en>{Mei}\n"Thank you, I will treasure it."
<es>

@132
<en>Our summer break was over and the second semester started. There were little changes from before.
<es>

@136
<en>{Principal}\n"My name is Aozora, and starting this semester, I will be in charge of this class. I know this change has come in the middle of the year, but I hope we can all get along well."
<es>

@139
<en>The principal was in charge of us now. It had been decades since she last taught, but I imagine the events with Mei had an influence on her.
<es>

@142
<en>The library no longer has a bibliosoph. Instead, we have students in charge of it.
<es>

@143
<en>I volunteered myself to be one.
<es>

@146
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm, I see."
<es>

@147
<en>Even now, I still research this island's folklore from time to time.
<es>

@149
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, this is..."
<es>

@150
<en>There was one folktale amongst them that especially caught my eyes.
<es>

@151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The Legend of Eiden Island's Goddess..."
<es>

@152
<en>Long ago, Eiden Island was regarded as sacred and believed to be the island where a goddess of unparalleled beauty resided.
<es>

@153
<en>She was once a human who was courted by countless men for her great beauty, yet she refused to marry any of them, and was turned into a goddess.
<es>

@154
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What a strange story... But was she really that beautiful? Well, I'm sure Mei is even more beautiful."
<es>

@155
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right, Mei?"
<es>

@156
<en>I whispered her name, thinking she might suddenly appear if I called her.
<es>

@157
<en>.....................
<es>

@158
<en>Of course, there was no reply.
<es>

@161
<en>Since then, the flowed bed has been in constant bloom. It wasn't long before autumn would really start setting in, but this one place continued to look like spring.
<es>

@162
<en>I lay down, burying myself in the flowers and looking up at the sky.
<es>

@164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, such a vast, clear sky."
<es>

@165
<en>It's still hot most days, but the sky was definitely an autumn sky.
<es>

@166
<en>Autumn came, winter came, and then spring and summer came again. Whenever I thought about the natural changing of seasons, my mind drifted afar.
<es>

@167
<en>How many seasons will I have to spend without Mei from now on?
<es>

@168
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is tough."
<es>

@169
<en>Mei is no longer here.\nThe person I loved the most is no longer anywhere.\nThat's the reality of it.
<es>

@170
<en>As time goes by, the feeling of loss seems to weigh even heavier on me. Sometimes I feel like the weight of that reality will crush me.
<es>

@171
<en>But I don't want to go back and redo things. It may have only been a short time, but I can say with confidence that we were truly happy.
<es>

@172
<en>I will never forget the time we spent together. The memories from those days will radiantly live forever in my heart.
<es>

@173
<en>So.........
<es>

@174
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Goodbye, Mei."
<es>

@175
<en>So I will say goodbye with a smile...
<es>
