@7
<en>The summer is getting ready to pass by us. The hot summer is coming to the end.
<es>

@9
<en>{Mei}\n"The breeze feels so good."
<es>

@10
<en>Mei seems to get more and more beautiful lately. She is becoming to be a perfect existence.
<es>

@11
<en>She doesn't have to become that beautiful. All I want is for her to be with me forever, that's all.
<es>

@12
<en>However, as she gets more beautiful, she keeps intriguing me even more.
<es>

@13
<en>{Mei}\n"The sky is beautiful, huh?"
<es>

@14
<en>Mei is the one that's beautiful. Her eyes that remind me of a beautiful lake reflects the sky, and that's more beautiful than the actual sky above me.
<es>

@15
<en>Maybe she is seeing this world a lot more beautifully than we do. Sometimes I can't help thinking that way.
<es>

@16
<en>I even thought her sights are cleansing this world. Whether something is either beautiful or not maybe decided by the one who sees it.
<es>

@17
<en>Mei's soul definitely is exceptionally beautiful. It is the most supreme artistic work created by God.
<es>

@18
<en>It's almost like the dense time that's gliding by is polishing the gem stone with in Mei.
<es>

@19
<en>{Mei}\n"Your hand."
<es>

@20
<en>When I realized, her slender white hand was held out toward me. I held that hand gently.
<es>

@21
<en>{Mei}\n"Chuckle."
<es>

@22
<en>The small hand is trying to entangle with mine. The innocent force is pulling me around.
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You will fall if you run like that!"
<es>

@24
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, we will both fall then!"
<es>

@25
<en>As the days passed, she seemed to get more and more translucent. That made me feel so loving but at the same time little sad.
<es>

@26
<en>Because we both knew the days like these won't last too much longer.
<es>

@31
<en>This was one of Mei's favorite places. By the time we had several dates, the place was filled with the carpet of white flowers.
<es>

@32
<en>In the middle of the field filled with the white flowers, I loved looking up to her while I lay down my head on her laps.
<es>

@33
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......................"
<es>

@34
<en>{Mei}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@35
<en>She noticed my glance and asked me.
<es>

@36
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I was just looking at you."
<es>

@37
<en>{Mei}\n"You're silly. Why don't you fall asleep? I'm letting you use my laps."
<es>

@38
<en>She was always complaining about that. But she is too beautiful to take my eyes off of.
<es>

@39
<en>As she gets more and more translucent, I felt like if I look away, she might disappear.
<es>

@40
<en>{Mei}\n"What are you thinking?"
<es>

@41
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmmm, about tonight's dinner."
<es>

@42
<en>{Mei}\n"Really, same here!"
<es>

@43
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Were you really thinking about dinner?"
<es>

@44
<en>{Mei}\n"What do you mean? Did you lie about thinking about dinner?"
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no. I feel like curry tonight."
<es>

@46
<en>{Mei}\n"Maybe curry with pork cutlet."
<es>

@47
<en>Mei sure eats well as usual. Maybe her appetite is keeping her in this world still. I wish I was right.......
<es>

@48
<en>If that was the case, I will feed her every single day so she will be with me forever.
<es>

@49
<en>{Mei}\n"Tears......."
<es>

@50
<en>Mei wiped off my tears. Her finger tip is wet.
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sleepy."
<es>

@52
<en>{Mei}\n"Then why don't you fall asleep?"
<es>

@53
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Kind of dozing off feels good."
<es>

@54
<en>I close my eyes. I'm not really sleepy.
<es>

@55
<en>Closing my eyes on Mei's laps sure felt so good, it was like lying on a fluffy pillow. I actually did doze off a little.
<es>

@56
<en>{Mei}\n"Giggle, giggle......."
<es>

@57
<en>Even with my eyes closed, I could tell Mei is looking down on me with a smile. I wonder if she thinks I'm really asleep.
<es>

@58
<en>{Mei}\n"I think I was born to fall in love."
<es>

@59
<en>She muttered. That sounded so special, I opened my eyes. She was in fact looking down on me with a smile.
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did you remember something?"
<es>

@61
<en>Did she remember something about herself? I don't know why but I just felt that way.
<es>

@62
<en>{Mei}\n"Once upon a time, a couple spent lots of time here in this spot."
<es>

@63
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@64
<en>It didn't seem like if it had anything to do with us. I didn't know what she was talking about. I continued to listen.
<es>

@65
<en>{Mei}\n"The two loved each other very much and even the others could easily tell that. A human love is truly a beautiful thing."
<es>

@66
<en>That line sounded like it came from Mei's heart, but this is supposed to be a "once upon a time"story.
<es>

@67
<en>I still couldn't figure out what she was trying to say.
<es>

@68
<en>{Mei}\n"Wanted to experience the feelings of a human love."
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You did?"
<es>

@70
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't know, I don't know whom I'm talking about."
<es>

@71
<en>She giggled. Well, I guess it doesn't matter. Maybe it's one of those made up stories.
<es>

@72
<en>Mei continued.
<es>

@73
<en>{Mei}\n"A lot of things happened. Witnessed happy things and sad things. But the admiration for the feelings called love increased more and more."
<es>

@74
<en>{Mei}\n"Many days and many months passed and finally, there was her chance to experience love."
<es>

@75
<en>{Mei}\n"In fact, the one who gave that chance was herself."
<es>

@76
<en>Mei paused there and smiled.
<es>

@77
<en>{Mei}\n"Three is a fairy tale like that."
<es>

@78
<en>That's the ending.
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see, it's just a fairy tale."
<es>

@80
<en>{Mei}\n"Yep, just a fairy tale. I looked into many of them."
<es>

@81
<en>I really wasn't interested in finding out if what she was telling was merely a fairy tale or if it was suggesting some kind of truth.
<es>

@82
<en>But every single word that came from Mei was so precious to me. I will not miss even one word from her.
<es>

@83
<en>So I always listened to her very carefully.
<es>

@84
<en>{Mei}\n"Then she fell in love."
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see. Then did she find out what it's like to be in love?"
<es>

@86
<en>That's what Mei wanted to know. That's what I promised her that I will let her experience.
<es>

@87
<en>Mei thought for a moment and then smiled mischievously.
<es>

@89
<en>{Mei}\n"It's a secret."
<es>

@90
<en>Her radiant smile almost made me cry. So, Mei's premonition was right.
<es>

@91
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@92
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes. Thank you."
<es>

@94
<en>She put her face close to me as if she was getting on top of me and pecked on my lips. It was just a slight touch but an extremely numbing kiss.
<es>

@95
<en>I probably will never feel such sensation from a kiss ever again in my life.
<es>

@97
<en>{Mei}\n"Can I ask you for a favor?"
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course."
<es>

@99
<en>I gave her an immediate reply. I will do whatever she wants me to do right now.
<es>

@100
<en>{Mei}\n"I really wasn't Mei Ibuki, was I?"
<es>

@101
<en>Mei wasn't really Mei Ibuki. She was made to be like Mei Ibuki.
<es>

@102
<en>The experiment to revive Mei Ibuki was a failure and then Mei was born.
<es>

@103
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm already used to it so it really doesn't matter, but it is rather strange to call myself with someone else's name, don't you think? So I want a new name."
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A new name?"
<es>

@105
<en>I had not idea that her favor was something that humble.
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You want me to name you?"
<es>

@107
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, I want Kazushi to name me."
<es>

@108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok, then let's see, what would be a nice name......?"
<es>

@109
<en>What would be good? It's hard to come up with something nice all of a sudden.
<es>

@110
<en>Shouldn't I really look into things like stroke counts and stuff?
<es>

@111
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Could that be a homework?"
<es>

@112
<en>{Mei}\n"Nope, I want you to name me now, because.........."
<es>

@113
<en>She started to say something and stopped but I knew what she was going to say. She might not have another chance.
<es>

@114
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok, then I need to think of something right now, huh?"
<es>

@115
<en>I thought seriously. What would be a good name for Mei?
<es>

@116
<en>{Mei}\n"I wonder what you will come up with......?"
<es>

@117
<en>She looked at me with such an anticipation which was giving me a pressure.
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, the last name is OK with Haruma, right?"
<es>

@119
<en>{Mei}\n"What? That's cutting corners!!"
<es>

@120
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We will have the same last name eventually anyway."
<es>

@121
<en>{Mei}\n"That's kind of tyranny, but, oh well. Ok, then how about the first name?"
<es>

@122
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's see......."
<es>

@123
<en>The first name is the challenge. Right now, it's Mei..........
<es>

@124
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I know!"
<es>

@125
<en>I came up with something. I told that to Mei.
<es>

@126
<en>{Mei}\n"Ok, I like that!"
<es>

@127
<en>Mei nodded as if she really liked it. Then she repeated the name many times to herself.
<es>

@128
<en>{Mei}\n"Thank you, I will treasure it."
<es>

@132
<en>The summer break was over and the second semester started. There were little changes.
<es>

@136
<en>{Principal}\n"Starting this semester, I will be taking over this class, I am Ms. Aozora. I am starting in the middle of the year, but I hope we get along well."
<es>

@139
<en>Our class was taken over by the principal.
<es>

@140
<en>I heard that it has been dozens of years since she had actually taught but I wonder this whole thing with Mei has affected her in any way at all.
<es>

@144
<en>I volunteered myself to be one.
<es>

@147
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmmmm, I see."
<es>

@148
<en>I still research about the island's traditions once in awhile.
<es>

@150
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, this is."
<es>

@151
<en>There was one tradition that caught my eyes.
<es>

@152
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The legend of the goddess of the Eiden island."
<es>

@153
<en>Eiden island used to be such a sacred island that people thought the goddess lived on this island.
<es>

@154
<en>And the goddess was the most beautiful of all the creatures.
<es>

@158
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's a strange story. I guess she must have been so beautiful. But I think Mei is more beautiful."
<es>

@159
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right, Mei?"
<es>

@160
<en>I still feel like she would pops up out of nowhere, so I muttered her name.......
<es>

@161
<en>......................
<es>

@162
<en>Of course, there was no reply.
<es>

@165
<en>Since then, the flower field was always filled with flowers. Although it's almost autumn, this field is always like if it is a spring time.
<es>

@166
<en>As I buried myself in the flowers, I laid down and looked up in the sky.
<es>

@168
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Gosh, the sky looks so high."
<es>

@169
<en>We still have some hot days, but the sky definitely is the one of the autumn.
<es>

@170
<en>The autumn, winter, spring and then summer again. When I think of the usually changes of the seasons, I almost feel dizzy.
<es>

@171
<en>How many seasons do I have to spend without Mei from now on?
<es>

@172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's tough......."
<es>

@173
<en>Mei isn't here. The one I love the most isn't here anymore. That's the reality.
<es>

@174
<en>As the days go by, the feel of loss weighs heavier and heavier on me. Sometimes, I feel like the weight might crush me.
<es>

@175
<en>But I don't want to go back and do things differently. Although it was a short period of time, I am confident that we were happy.
<es>

@176
<en>I will never forget the time we spent together. The memories from those days will live radiantly forever in my heart.
<es>

@177
<en>So..........
<es>

@178
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good bye, Mei."
<es>

@179
<en>So I will say good bye with a smile.
<es>
