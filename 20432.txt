@7
<en>{Natsume}\n"That's why you cannot come in."
<es>

@10
<en>{Principal}\n"Heh. Fine. Let's see how long all of you can last in there."
<es>

@15
<en>Night fell as we remained barricaded in.
<es>

@18
<en>{Appo}\n"I'm so hungry."
<es>

@23
<en>{Daigo}\n"After all that, we couldn't find anything in here. Are you sure it's here?"
<es>

@27
<en>{Ran}\n"There's so much stuff it's hard to tell, plus there's tons of empty rooms..."
<es>

@31
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sorry, everyone. I've only got a few clues."
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, this is just the first day. We've seized the building, so we can take our time."
<es>

@36
<en>{Pierre}\n"For now, dinner!"
<es>

@41
<en>{Rin}\n"Here we are!"
<es>

@42
<en>Just at that moment, Fujisaki-san brought in our meals.
<es>

@45
<en>{Rin}\n"I only made onigiri tonight because I didn't have much time."
<es>

@46
<en>She said it apologetically.
<es>

@47
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is great. Thank you."
<es>

@50
<en>{Rin}\n"Okay. From the right, you've got salmon, plum, kelp, seaweed, and tuna...and we also have miso soup."
<es>

@55
<en>{Ran}\n"I'll have tuna!"
<es>

@59
<en>{Daigo}\n"I'll have salmon, plum, kelp, seaweed, and tuna."
<es>

@63
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's everything, man! Why didn't you just say "everything"? And dude, don't eat everything!"
<es>

@66
<en>{Daigo}\n"I didn't say everything because I knew you'd say that."
<es>

@71
<en>{Rin}\n"There's a lot, so don't worry. Take a couple more, Daigo."
<es>

@76
<en>{Appo}\n"Rin-chan really is everyone's #1 bride."
<es>

@79
<en>{Rin}\n"Bride? Is that the character I'm labeled as?"
<es>

@80
<en>Fujisaki-san looked flattered.
<es>

@84
<en>{Sakura}\n"And every night she's some guy's comfort woman, right?"
<es>

@87
<en>{Rin}\n"What?"
<es>

@88
<en>And then Sakura had to go and ruin Rin's blissful moment.
<es>

@92
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, go through me first, okay? You're not allowed to touch the stripper without permission."
<es>

@93
<en>{Rin}\n"Stripper? I'm not a bride... huh?"
<es>

@100
<en>It felt like a regular, peaceful meal in the cafeteria. Mizuki looked happy as she watched us.
<es>

@105
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How long are we gonna barricade ourselves in here?"
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Until we find the stone, of course. Or until the principal gives up and helps us out."
<es>

@107
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But I'm not sure if the principal will keep quiet."
<es>

@108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I just hope she doesn't try anything behind our backs..."
<es>

@109
<en>Something may happen at night. We can't relax too much.
<es>

@114
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Morning, huh?"
<es>

@115
<en>The next day came uneventfully.
<es>

@116
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She didn't do anything, huh?"
<es>

@117
<en>It was a surprise. I thought she might take some action during the night.
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Quite disappointing..."
<es>

@123
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uwah?!"
<es>

@124
<en>It happened right as I dropped my guard.
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wh-when did she?!"
<es>

@126
<en>How did she get in here? The door was locked from the inside.
<es>

@131
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@132
<en>Again, Natsume-chan stood in the principal's way.
<es>

@133
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan, look out!!"
<es>

@134
<en>{Natsume}\n"You're an eyesore."
<es>

@135
<en>Speaking in a hushed tone, Natsume-chan bit her finger until it started to bleed.
<es>

@137
<en>Fww!
<es>

@138
<en>Natsume-chan swung her arm and a few drops of her blood flew towards the principal.
<es>

@139
<en>{Principal}\n"Heh."
<es>

@143
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh... She disappeared."
<es>

@144
<en>The principal was just gone. No footsteps, no hairs, nothing.
<es>

@145
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What that hell was that?"
<es>

@148
<en>{Natsume}\n"That was just an illusion. She can't really come in, so she's pestering us."
<es>

@149
<en>{Kazushi}\n"An illusion?"
<es>

@150
<en>What a clear illusion that was! Is that what alchemy does too?
<es>

@151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Damn, she can do tricks like that? We really can't let ourselves be caught off guard."
<es>

@152
<en>We don't know what she's capable of doing.
<es>

@155
<en>{Natsume}\n"No worries. I won't let Hisae in. Ao's here too."
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ao...? Oh, Haruka. Yeah, Haruka's dependable."
<es>

@159
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, you keep looking for the stone. We'll take care of the complicated parts."
<es>

@160
<en>Natsume-chan looked very reliable.
<es>

@161
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks."
<es>

@162
<en>I naturally reached my hand out to her head.
<es>

@163
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Someday I'll repay the favor. I'll help you whenever you're in trouble, Natsume-chan."
<es>

@166
<en>I patted her on the head and Natsume-chan shrugged her shoulders a bit.
<es>

@167
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hold that promise until everything is done."
<es>

@168
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, you're right."
<es>

@173
<en>Again, no major movements...and another night came.
<es>

@176
<en>{Rin}\n"I made sukiyaki tonight."
<es>

@178
<en>The ingredients in the pot were simmering inside the furnace. The great smell traveled across the room, whetting everyone's appetite.
<es>

@182
<en>{Pierre}\n"Is it me or are we eating better food than usual? Is this okay?"
<es>

@187
<en>{Daigo}\n"They say you can't fight on an empty stomach."
<es>

@192
<en>{Haruka}\n"Who wants eggs?"
<es>

@193
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I do! Give me two! How about you, Mizuki?"
<es>

@198
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@200
<en>Mizuki was spacing out.
<es>

@201
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki? Are you okay? Do you want an egg?"
<es>

@202
<en>Mizuki looked at me as I asked her again.
<es>

@205
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, I do, I do. Even Stallone drinks raw eggs."
<es>

@206
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't drink it, put it on your meat. Here, have some meat."
<es>

@207
<en>I broke an egg over her bowl and poured it on her meat.
<es>

@210
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahaha, that's a lot of meat. Thanks."
<es>

@212
<en>Mizuki grabbed part of the pile of meat and brought it up, but stopped halfway.
<es>

@213
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@216
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah..."
<es>

@217
<en>Mizuki was behaving strangely. Everyone noticed something wrong with her.
<es>

@218
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's wrong, Mizuki? Not feeling well?"
<es>

@221
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, sorry, it's not like that."
<es>

@222
<en>She smiled to try and keep us from worrying, but tears welled up in her eyes.
<es>

@223
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki?"
<es>

@228
<en>{Mizuki}\n"This may sound a bit strange to you all, but I'm finding this fun."
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fun?"
<es>

@230
<en>It was the total opposite of what I was expecting her to say. Mizuki looked around with a beam of satisfaction.
<es>

@233
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I am so grateful for what you guys are doing for me. This is just like camping. And if this could go on forever, I don't think I'd mind being this way."
<es>

@236
<en>Everyone stopped eating and looked at Mizuki.
<es>

@239
<en>{Ran}\n"What're you talking about, Mizuki? We've come this far for you, so you are going to swim again."
<es>

@244
<en>{Fuusen}\n"That's right. I want to swim with the dolphins too, so you have to teach me how. Okay?"
<es>

@248
<en>{Haruka}\n"Me too! Me too!"
<es>

@251
<en>{Ran}\n"That sounds like a good business. 'Mizuki's Swimming Class'. I can charge 10,000 yen per person for half a day with Mizuki and dolphins."
<es>

@252
<en>Ran sounded scary with how seriously she thought about that. She wasn't joking either, though it could be fun...
<es>

@257
<en>{Rin}\n"I'm having fun too. I'm not cooking for people I don't know. I'm cooking for friends whose likes I know, so I can put more effort in than usual."
<es>

@258
<en>Fujisaki-san really did resemble a newlywed. Even in this situation, we were all having a good time.
<es>

@262
<en>{Ran}\n"Maybe I should put together a tour and rake in tourists? Eiden Island: Swim with a hot instructor and the dolphins. 4 days and 3 nights for 56,000 yen."
<es>

@267
<en>{Fuusen}\n"That's enough, Ran."
<es>

@272
<en>{Sakura}\n"We can all take a bath together again, and I can try and wash Mizuki's back, and then Mizuki'll run away, swimming through the bath."
<es>

@275
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's because you started feeling up my breasts, Sakura."
<es>

@279
<en>{Rin}\n"I want to go to the beach with everyone again. Summer's already over this year, but how about next year?"
<es>

@280
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We'll have to cure her body first for that. Don't worry, you'll be fine. We're all here for you."
<es>

@281
<en>Everyone looked at Mizuki with a warm gaze, and her shoulders started to tremble.
<es>

@285
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah... thank you. I won't give up."
<es>

@286
<en>Something sparkled in Mizuki's eyes. It was a drop that glimmered like a diamond and trailed down her cheek.
<es>

@287
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahaha... Oh, jeez..."
<es>

@288
<en>With a grin of embarrassment, Mizuki wiped her tears with her hand.
<es>

@289
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey."
<es>

@290
<en>I also wiped her tears away with my fingers.
<es>

@291
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't cry. Eat your meat!"
<es>

@294
<en>{Haruka}\n"Right! Let's eat!"
<es>

@299
<en>{Pierre}\n"Alright! Let's eat too, guys!"
<es>

@300
<en>We all began to enjoy your dinner.
<es>

@305
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki, go ahead and eat and get better soon."
<es>

@306
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes."
<es>

@311
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@314
<en>Ran fell flat on her face.
<es>

@317
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey! What happened!"
<es>

@318
<en>{Appo}\n"Ugh..."
<es>

@320
<en>{Daigo}\n"Ugh..."
<es>

@322
<en>Appo and Daigo also fell on the floor. Then, everyone else eating began to collapse one after the other.
<es>

@323
<en>{Mizuki}\n"H-huh? What happened to everyone?"
<es>

@324
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Poison?"
<es>

@325
<en>I felt the blood draining from my face.
<es>

@326
<en>{Sakura}\n"Zzz...zzz..."
<es>

@327
<en>But everyone who fell down was snoring.
<es>

@328
<en>{Mizuki}\n"They're just sleeping?"
<es>

@331
<en>{Natsume}\n"Sleeping pills..."
<es>

@332
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The principal - she must have done this. But how?"
<es>

@333
<en>{Natsume}\n"She spiked the water."
<es>

@334
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@335
<en>We cooked using tap water. I guess she put the drugs in our water supply before we started cooking.
<es>

@344
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh...!?"
<es>

@345
<en>Within a split second, I lost my sight amidst a dazzling light.
<es>

@346
<en>{Natsume}\n"No, don't..."
<es>

@348
<en>Natsume-chan cried out in panic and the wind blew a twister through the room!
<es>

@351
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Aahhh...!"
<es>

@352
<en>There was an intense, miniature tornado in our room, throwing things through the air.
<es>

@353
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is this?"
<es>

@360
<en>As the twister dwindled away, someone appeared from its core: The principal.
<es>

@361
<en>{Principal}\n"I'm finally in."
<es>

@362
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Principal!!"
<es>

@363
<en>The principal slowly approached us with a twisted grin on her face. Though small in size, she seemed large and intimidating.
<es>

@366
<en>{Principal}\n"Have you found the stone?"
<es>

@367
<en>She asked us this sarcastically, knowing full well that we still didn't have it.
<es>

@372
<en>{Natsume}\n"She always looks at us condescendingly. That's why I hate her."
<es>

@375
<en>{Principal}\n"Play time is over. You children are no longer on summer break."
<es>

@376
<en>She slinked ever closer like a predator closing in on its prey.
<es>

@381
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Damn...!"
<es>

@382
<en>There's no way out! Should we just abandon the building? But if I do, then we won't be able to achieve anything.
<es>

@385
<en>{Principal}\n"If you apologize nicely, I will forgive you. If you resist, then I will deal with you appropriately."
<es>

@386
<en>A fearsome light shone beneath her eyes. That unknown pressure nearly made my knees give in, but I wasn't about to kneel down now.
<es>

@387
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please! Principal! Help us!"
<es>

@390
<en>I bowed my head. The principal looked stunned a bit.
<es>

@391
<en>{Principal}\n"You're still spouting that nonsense? You brats have barricaded yourselves inside my laboratory and now you're asking me for help? Why won't you just give up?"
<es>

@392
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I can't. We have no choice but to use the power of the stone."
<es>

@393
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please! Help us!!"
<es>

@396
<en>{Principal}\n"You're persistent."
<es>

@401
<en>The principal closed the remaining gap all at once.
<es>

@402
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh...Ahhh!"
<es>

@405
<en>My body flew through the air, slammed against the wall, and hung there pressed against it.
<es>

@406
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@407
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm okay... But I just can't move."
<es>

@410
<en>The principal chuckled as she kept me adhered to the wall. It was hard to believe she had such power.
<es>

@411
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please! Help us!!"
<es>

@412
<en>{Principal}\n"How dare you say you need my help! I know you guys are looking for an almighty stone, but such a stone doesn't exist!"
<es>

@413
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? But..."
<es>

@416
<en>{Principal}\n"Do you really think that you can cure her legs if you use the stone? Is that what you were promised? Nothing that convenient exists in this world!"
<es>

@417
<en>The principal yelled at me through a face full of rage.
<es>

@420
<en>{Principal}\n"Even if you did find the stone, you wouldn't be able to use it anyways because you lack the ability and commitment!"
<es>

@421
<en>{Principal}\n"Even with the stone, it could take your entire life to learn to succeed at recreating one!"
<es>

@424
<en>{Principal}\n"I have already made the commitment to accomplish my mission at the cost of my life. How about you? Are you ready to die for her?"
<es>

@425
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, I am."
<es>

@428
<en>I replied right away, which surprised the principal a bit.
<es>

@429
<en>{Principal}\n"A quick answer, huh? You didn't even think about it, did you?"
<es>

@430
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't have to think about it. Mizuki is more important to me than anything, and that won't change."
<es>

@431
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If I can get Mizuki's legs back, I would even give up my own."
<es>

@432
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wait, Kazushi!"
<es>

@433
<en>I just saw a light in the principal's eye.
<es>

@436
<en>{Principal}\n"Are you sure about that?"
<es>

@437
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, I am."
<es>

@438
<en>I'd already thought about it many times. I know about the principal of equivalent exchange as well.
<es>

@439
<en>However, no one - even God, could grant my wish.
<es>

@440
<en>{Principal}\n"Okay, then. I will check and see if you are really sure."
<es>

@441
<en>Before I knew it, there was a gigantic hatchet in the principal's hand.
<es>

@442
<en>With glaring eyes, the principal swung the hatchet up.
<es>

@443
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you doing!?"
<es>

@444
<en>{Principal}\n"If you are truly ready for this, then I promise I will help you!"
<es>

@445
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You promise?"
<es>

@448
<en>{Principal}\n"I will do everything in my power."
<es>

@449
<en>Then that was fine. Using the principal's methods were more certain than recklessly struggling.
<es>

@451
<en>I closed my eyes.
<es>

@452
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wait!"
<es>

@454
<en>Fwwwwmm!!
<es>

@455
<en>I heard a whoosh with no hesitation.
<es>

@456
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Nooooooo!!"
<es>

@457
<en>I heard Mizuki's scream and felt something something touching against my legs.
<es>

@460
<en>Ding!!
<es>

@461
<en>I heard a high-pitched noise and saw a small burst of light in the corner of my eyes.
<es>

@462
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's that?"
<es>

@466
<en>I saw Mizuki holding my legs and the hatchet blade stopping a few centimeters from her neck.
<es>

@467
<en>If the hatchet had stopped any later...
<es>

@468
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki! Are you crazy? What are you doing!? Are you okay?"
<es>

@469
<en>Mizuki stared at me hard.
<es>

@471
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You're the crazy one, Kazushi! Why do you have to give up your legs for me?! Do you think I'd be happy if you did that?!"
<es>

@472
<en>With tears in her eyes, Mizuki shouted at me in anger. To me, she was much scarier than the hatchet.
<es>

@473
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So-sorry. But you could have been killed yourself, Mizuki."
<es>

@474
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm okay...oh."
<es>

@475
<en>Mizuki tried to feel her neck. Her necklace at slid around to her back along with the pendant I bought her from Miya-san's store.
<es>

@476
<en>The stone in the pendant was gone. It was broken in half and lying on the floor. The hatchet much have directly hit the stone.
<es>

@477
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It broke..."
<es>

@478
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It saved your life, though."
<es>

@479
<en>Maybe that little stone had a power we hadn't seen. It took such a hard blow.
<es>

@480
<en>{Mizuki}\n"This really is a lucky charm."
<es>

@481
<en>Mizuki tenderly wrapped the broken stone with her hands.
<es>

@482
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm sorry, and thank you for protecting me."
<es>

@483
<en>{Principal}\n"*Sigh*"
<es>

@484
<en>I recalled the principal was here at her sigh. She looked down at Mizuki as if whatever had possessed her had been dispelled.
<es>

@485
<en>{Principal}\n"You, Hinata-san. Weren't you scared of the hatchet?"
<es>

@486
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I am now, but I didn't think about it."

@487
<en>{Principal}\n"You would throw away your life for his legs?"
<es>

@488
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, I wouldn't do that - I want us to live together. Neither one can be missing."
<es>

@489
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But... if I had died, then so long as Kazushi survived, I would live on inside of him."
<es>

@490
<en>Mizuki stared fixedly at the principal, who opened her eyes in surprise.
<es>

@491
<en>{Principal}\n"Ohhh!"
<es>

@492
<en>The principal moaned and turned her eyes to the sky. Her eyes closed and she froze like a statue.
<es>

@493
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Principal...?"
<es>

@494
<en>The principal just looked up. She seemed to be crying, and I was at a loss for words.
<es>

@495
<en>Was she really the same person? She was swinging a hatchet just a moment ago and now she's crying...?
<es>

@496
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Principal...?"
<es>

@498
<en>*Clang*...
<es>

@499
<en>The hatchet dropped from the principal's hand.
<es>

@500
<en>{Principal}\n"How did I forget that all this time? We people are very forgetful creatures."
<es>

@501
<en>Warm drops fell from her eyes, glittering as they trailed down her cheeks. Tears?......No.
<es>

@502
<en>They clattered on the floor. They weren't liquid, they were solid like stones.
<es>

@503
<en>Those pebbles rolled across the floor, growing bigger as they rolled until they were the size of eggs.
<es>

@504
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wh-what...?"
<es>

@505
<en>A strange phenomenon was transpiring before my eyes. I cautiously picked one of them up.
<es>

@506
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A stone?"
<es>

@507
<en>It was firm, yet soft. It wasn't alive, but had warmth like a living thing. Was it really a stone?
<es>

@511
<en>{Principal}\n"Did they come from inside of me?"
<es>

@512
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes... your tears..."
<es>

@513
<en>{Principal}\n"I see. I was crying?"
<es>

@514
<en>The principal muttered, all her tears now gone. In their place remained a warm, gentle smile directed at Mizuki.
<es>

@517
<en>{Principal}\n"What you said just reminded me of something very important."
<es>

@518
<en>The principal kept smiling at us. Neither of us was sure of what's going on.
<es>

@521
<en>{Principal}\n"Hinata-san, I'm sorry I tried to hurt your loved one."
<es>

@522
<en>The principal bowed to apologize. I can't believe this! And yet Mizuki was still staring her down!
<es>

@527
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I shouldn't forgive you... But if you promise you will never, ever try it again, I will."
<es>

@528
<en>Unlike me, who was left feeling bewildered, Mizuki showed her strength in her words. Then principal silently nodded several times in agreement.
<es>

@531
<en>{Principal}\n"Thank you."
<es>

@532
<en>The golden egg-sized stone emitted a golden light in my hand.
<es>

@536
<en>{Principal}\n".................."
<es>

@537
<en>The principal looked quietly at the stone. She looked like she was praying in silence.
<es>

@538
<en>{Principal}\n"Good bye..."
<es>

@539
<en>And she muttered something under her breath. I didn't hear it well, but it sounded like she said good bye to someone.
<es>

@542
<en>{Principal}\n"Haruma-kun, that stone is the one I... you were looking for."
<es>

@543
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? This!?"
<es>

@544
<en>{Principal}\n"I'll leave that stone in your hands."
<es>

@545
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Really?"
<es>

@548
<en>{Principal}\n"You may use it as you wish. But in exchange... please be sure to use it to make someone smile."
<es>

@549
<en>{Principal}\n"So that no one ever has to cry anymore."
<es>

@550
<en>I was unsure of what lay behind her words, but the feelings she entrusted to me hit home.
<es>

@551
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes. Absolutely."
<es>

@555
<en>I drew Mizuki closer to my side, holding her tightly as she laid her body upon me.
<es>

@556
<en>It may take a long time to cure Mizuki's legs, but I won't give up.
<es>

@557
<en>I gripped the stone entrusted to me, and sensed that the thoughts and feelings of many resided in that stone.
<es>

@560
<en>Miya was waiting for Hisae to come out of the experiment ward.
<es>

@563
<en>{Principal}\n"Oh, you're here."
<es>

@564
<en>Hisae looked surprised.
<es>

@569
<en>{Miya}\n"Are you okay?"
<es>

@572
<en>{Principal}\n"A bit tired."
<es>

@573
<en>Hisae smiled feebly and staggered a little. Miya quickly held her up, and Hisae smiled as she took advantage of his support.
<es>

@576
<en>{Principal}\n"You were watching us, weren't you?"
<es>

@577
<en>Miya didn't respond, but she knew that silence meant yes.
<es>

@580
<en>{Miya}\n"I was a bit worried because you looked so serious with the hatchet."
<es>

@581
<en>Hisae smiled wryly.
<es>

@584
<en>{Principal}\n"I may have been more serious than you think."
<es>

@587
<en>{Miya}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@588
<en>Miya looked at her in disbelief and Hisae returned a vague smile.\nMiya heaved a sigh.
<es>

@591
<en>{Miya}\n"I'm surprised you relinquished that stone after you finally found it."
<es>

@592
<en>So Miya had been watching, and knew everything. Hisae wore a thin smile.
<es>

@595
<en>{Principal}\n"I'm getting old. I remembered the past."
<es>

@596
<en>Hisae was recalling an event a long, long time ago. She still remembered it vividly, just like it was yesterday.
<es>

@597
<en>And yet she had completely forgotten those words - the words Hinata Mizuki clearly told her.
<es>

@598
<en>Hisae was told the exact same thing a long time ago.
<es>

@599
<en>{Principal}\n"The stone would not have appeared had she not reminded me of that saying. So, the stone is hers."
<es>

@602
<en>{Miya}\n"Yes. That's good."
<es>

@603
<en>Miya didn't respond clearly, but it seemed Miya was happy with the fact that Hisae gave up the stone.
<es>

@605
<en>{Principal}\n"Even when we swear to never forget, we people still forget things one by one."
<es>

@606
<en>{Miya}\n"People can not live if they don't forget."
<es>

@607
<en>{Principal}\n"Am I still considered a person?"
<es>

@608
<en>{Miya}\n"Yes, of course."
<es>

@609
<en>Hisae bashfully looked up at the sky at Miya's unhesitant words. The end of summer sky was just as vast as it was years ago.
<es>

@616
<en>I finally reached the beach with Mizuki on my back.
<es>

@617
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's go to where the waves lap against the shore."
<es>

@620
<en>{Haruka}\n"Have fun!"
<es>

@623
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? You guys aren't coming?"
<es>

@628
<en>{Fuusen}\n"We'll watch you from here, so go ahead, you two."
<es>

@631
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You sure? Then I'll be back. Kazushi, go!"
<es>

@632
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay."
<es>

@636
<en>......
<es>

@637
<en>...
<es>

@640
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, they're gone now."
<es>

@645
<en>{Pierre}\n"But it still failed."
<es>

@649
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yeah. I think she's only gonna have about ten minutes or so."
<es>

@653
<en>{Rin}\n"To only have so little time... She's finally able to walk, but..."
<es>

@657
<en>{Sakura}\n"They don't show it, but they must be really disappointed."
<es>

@658
<en>{Rin}\n"Especially after they got their hopes up so much. They must be shocked."
<es>

@662
<en>{Appo}\n"Those two'll be fine."
<es>

@666
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Yes, I'm sure they will."
<es>

@670
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yes. They're both..."
<es>

@672
<en>......
<es>

@673
<en>...
<es>

@677
<en>I walked slowly so I wouldn't lose my balance in the waves and we finally reached the edge.
<es>

@678
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm setting you down? Can you stand?"
<es>

@681
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes. Let me down slowly."
<es>

@682
<en>Mizuki quietly nodded. Given when she drank the solution, it should start working around now.
<es>

@683
<en>I knelt down and slowly let go of Mizuki. Her toes landed on the sand. It had been a while since she last felt the sand on her feet.
<es>

@684
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Slowly."
<es>

@685
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah..."
<es>

@686
<en>Mizuki was very calm. I might've been more nervous than she was.
<es>

@689
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Here I go."
<es>

@692
<en>Mizuki let go of my back. She kept her hand on my shoulder to steady herself as she stood on her own two feet.
<es>

@695
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh... Yes! I did it!! I did it!!"
<es>

@696
<en>Mizuki jumped a couple inches. And then she jumped up again, this time higher.
<es>

@699
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wow!! Great!! They feel like my legs."
<es>

@700
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They are your legs."
<es>

@703
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, that's right. It's been a while since I could move them, so I forgot."
<es>

@704
<en>Mizuki took her socks and shoes off and stood barefoot on the beach.
<es>

@707
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The sand...it feels so good."
<es>

@708
<en>Mizuki leaned on me as she played in the sand with her feet.
<es>

@709
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why don't you go for a swim? You miss feeling the water too, don't you?"
<es>

@712
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But I didn't bring my swimsuit..."
<es>

@713
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So? You used to swim naked all the time."
<es>

@716
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah! Don't remind me! Pervert!!"
<es>

@718
<en>Mizuki stuck her tongue out at me and twirled around me. She hopped around, frolicking on the beach.
<es>

@719
<en>We only had a short a period of time to have fun.
<es>

@720
<en>The principal said that the stone wouldn't solve all of our problems. Now I fully understood what she meant.
<es>

@721
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, aren't you gonna swim?"
<es>

@724
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Do you want to see me naked that badly? Well, I guess it has been a long time."
<es>

@725
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't say that."
<es>

@728
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't need to today. You're gonna fix my legs permanently someday, right?"
<es>

@729
<en>Mizuki looked at me. She believed in me - or maybe she was trying to believe in me.
<es>

@730
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, of course."
<es>

@731
<en>I haven't given up hope. Someday, I will get her legs back to normal...\nSomeday.
<es>

@732
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Then I won't swim today."
<es>

@735
<en>After quietly muttering that, Mizuki returned to my side. We were all discouraged that it hadn't gone as well as we'd hoped.
<es>

@736
<en>We were concerned about what was going to happen in a few minutes, when the potion wore off. Mizuki's legs would probably stop moving again.
<es>

@737
<en>Mizuki and I will feel down after tasting a few fleeting moments of joy and freedom. However, we will keep on trying, together.
<es>

@740
<en>As I watched Mizuki standing on the beach with the evening sun in the backdrop, I saw water splashing in the distance: the dolphins!!
<es>

@743
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Those guys came too."
<es>

@744
<en>{Dolphins}\n *SKREE*
<es>

@745
<en>The two dolphins flipped through the water as if to welcome Mizuki back. She looked at them, blinking in the bright sun.
<es>

@746
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure you don't want to swim?"
<es>

@749
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes. I'm fine. I want to spend this little, yet important time doing what I really want to do."
<es>

@750
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What you really want to do......don't you mean swimming?"
<es>

@753
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@754
<en>Mizuki just looked out at the sea without answering. As she gazed upon it, she found my hand and held it tight.
<es>

@757
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can swim once I'm really cured. I will be, right?"
<es>

@758
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course you will. I promised to fix your legs, and I will - even if I have to spend the rest of my life on it."
<es>

@761
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The rest of your life? Are you sure about saying that so easily?"
<es>

@762
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not saying it easily. This is a symbol of my vow."
<es>

@763
<en>I was going to give this to her when she was completely cured.
<es>

@764
<en>But on second thought, I decided to give it to her now as proof of my promise to her.
<es>

@767
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah...this stone..."
<es>

@768
<en>The mermaid's tear. I asked Miya-san to make a ring out of the broken stone.
<es>

@771
<en>{Mizuki}\n"For me?"
<es>

@772
<en>Mizuki looked nervous. I took her left hand and placed the ring on her finger.
<es>

@773
<en>Mizuki squints at her ring finger.
<es>

@774
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wow, you're really gonna stay with me for the rest of your life?"
<es>

@775
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Even though you'll tell me no."
<es>

@778
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But I may burden you for the rest of your life...?"
<es>

@779
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I won't let you do that. I will get you to walk on your own."
<es>

@780
<en>That's right. I haven't given up. Our true battle has just begun.
<es>

@781
<en>Today is only a short time, but some day... I will make it for good.
<es>

@784
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, Kazushi."
<es>

@785
<en>Mizuki called for me.
<es>

@786
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah? What is it?"
<es>

@787
<en>As we watched the dolphins dancing in the sea, Mizuki nestled up to me with her hand around my arm.
<es>

@790
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I love you."
<es>

@791
<en>Mizuki said, as though she had to choke out the middle word. She tightly held my arm.
<es>

@792
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. I love you too."
<es>

@793
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I know."
<es>

@795
<en>Then we kissed each other. During the limited time given to us, we spent most of it kissing each other for a long, long time.
<es>

@796
<en>This is the furthest we could come today. But someday soon, she will swim with the dolphins again.
<es>

@797
<en>And on that occasion, I will swim with her.
<es>

@798
<en>And someday, she and I will swim together in the ocean forever.
<es>
