<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wow, it's still so slimy... and this smells..."
<es>

@11
<en>Mizuki scooped up my semen from her body and smelled it. It was a little embarrassing for me to see her doing it.
<es>

@14
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, hey, there are little tadpoles swimming in this, right? Ugh, and I swallowed it... I wonder if those tadpoles are swimming in my stomach?"
<es>

@17
<en>{Mizuki}\n"........."
<es>

@18
<en>She was visualizing it.
<es>

@21
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ugh, yuck..."
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You didn't have to force yourself to swallow."
<es>

@25
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You never know how something will be until you try, right? And it wasn't so bad."
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@27
<en>I don't think I'd drink it myself, but I guess love conquers all, huh? She sure does love me.
<es>

@30
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you snickering at?"
<es>

@31
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, nothing..."
<es>

@32
<en>Today, again, we took one step towards adulthood.
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's hot again today."
<es>

@38
<en>I guess I'll go swimming with Mizuki. I'm a better swimmer now.
<es>

@41
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!"
<es>

@42
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Perfect timing!"
<es>

@43
<en>Mizuki ran up to me with great timing as if we'd planned it. But why did she look so rushed?
<es>

@44
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's going on?"
<es>

@45
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You can't believe this! Come with me now!"
<es>

@50
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's that?"
<es>

@51
<en>I saw something moving in and out of the water. Some sort of dorsal fin? And it's quite big, too.
<es>

@52
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It can't be..."
<es>

@55
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I know!"
<es>

@56
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sharks?!"
<es>

@59
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Nooooo! Dolphins! They're dolphins!!"
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow! Dolphins!!"
<es>

@63
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The dolphins finally came! What a surprise!"
<es>

@64
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's great! They've finally come for you!!"
<es>

@65
<en>Mizuki said she'd never seen dolphins before, but now this was really happening.
<es>

@66
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Amazing! I just told you about them not too long ago, Kazushi! I'd never seen them since I came here. But right after I told you, they just came!"
<es>

@67
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Did you bring them here?"
<es>

@68
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's just a coincidence, but I'm happy for you, Mizuki."
<es>

@71
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Thanks! ...Ah!!"
<es>

@73
<en>*splash*
<es>

@75
<en>The dolphins leaped up out of the water. There were two of them in the bay. As their arcs crossed, the sprays of water formed a rainbow.
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, this is just like a dolphin show!"
<es>

@79
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So cute! Look, they look like a couple, don't they?"
<es>

@80
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No idea. But they surely look good together."
<es>

@81
<en>The two dolphins were swimming together as if making out in the water.
<es>

@84
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm gonna go for a swim!"
<es>

@86
<en>Mizuki suddenly started striping off all her clothes.
<es>

@87
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, wait..."
<es>

@88
<en>I don't know why, but I looked away from her. Even though I'd seen her naked before, it was still embarrassing under different situations.
<es>

@91
<en>Or so I thought before I saw she had her swimsuit on underneath. She had been planning to swim from the start.
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's gone..."
<es>

@95
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah, don't run, don't run away! Ruu, ru, ru, ru, ru, ru, ru!"
<es>

@96
<en>The dolphins were leaving. At a distance, they were playing around, swimming away from Mizuki.
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You shouldn't have jumped in. You scared them."
<es>

@98
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Come on! Don't act like this is someone else's problem. Come here with me and help me get them over here."
<es>

@99
<en>Mizuki hopped up and down as she called me over.
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, your tits are bouncing up and down too."
<es>

@101
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wh-what are you looking at, stupid Kazushi!? Come on in, Kazushi!"
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think It's gonna make any difference."
<es>

@103
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What was all that swimming training for? It's time to show me what you've got."
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You may be right."
<es>

@105
<en>I finally became able to swim today, and suddenly my chance is already here. I was so lucky, I had to wonder if the Goddess of the Sea had taken a liking to me.
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll be right there!"
<es>

@107
<en>I took off my clothes and got ready to jump into the sea.
<es>

@108
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wah! Kazushi, you don't have to take off your drawers!!"
<es>

@109
<en>Boy she's demanding. It's a shame to put my underwear back on, but I guess I have to.
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh. I've never been in the water with my underwear on."
<es>

@115
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It doesn't matter, men's underwear and swimsuits look the same. Anyway, come on, help me call them. Ruu, ru, ru, ru, ru, ru, ru!"
<es>

@116
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ruu, ru, ru, ru, ru, ru, ru!"
<es>

@117
<en>I called them along with Mizuki, but I felt this wasn't the right way to do it.
<es>

@118
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREEE*
<es>

@121
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It responded!"
<es>

@122
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow. Is that for real?"
<es>

@124
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREE*
<es>

@125
<en>Another dolphin cried out, too. Were they really responding to us? One of the fins swam over to us.
<es>

@126
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREE*
<es>

@127
<en>The water was too shallow where we were, so they couldn't get closer. We were still a ways away from them.
<es>

@128
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki, go ahead."
<es>

@129
<en>I pushed Mizuki on the back.
<es>

@132
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Only me? You are not gonna come with me?"
<es>

@133
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think I'm ready to swim out that far, and I don't want to drown and get in your way. You're gonna be fine."
<es>

@136
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Okay."
<es>

@138
<en>Mizuki slowly swam along in a slightly awkward way.
<es>

@139
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREE*
<es>

@140
<en>The dolphins cruised around as if they were welcoming Mizuki.
<es>

@141
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki! They're waiting for you!"
<es>

@142
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes!"
<es>

@143
<en>Mizuki took a deep breath and dived into the water. The dolphins disappeared beneath the surface as well.
<es>

@144
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki, good luck!!"
<es>

@146
<en>Neither Mizuki nor the dolphins had come back up yet. I had no idea what was going on under water.\nOne minute passed...\nTwo minutes passed...
<es>

@151
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi!"
<es>

@152
<en>Mizuki bobbed back up right in front of me.
<es>

@153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How was it?"
<es>

@156
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Come down with me!"
<es>

@157
<en>She took my hand.
<es>

@158
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Down? Wah!"
<es>

@161
<en>She pulled me down with incredible strength - more than I thought a woman could have. And from in the water no less.
<es>

@165
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Woooo!!"
<es>

@166
<en>It turned out the dolphin was pulling us along.
<es>

@167
<en>{Mizuki}\n"They want to play with us!!"
<es>

@168
<en>With a sparkling smile, Mizuki gripped the dolphin's dorsal fin with one hand and my hand with the other.
<es>

@169
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is incredible! You've already become friends with them!"
<es>

@170
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's so weird! It feels like I've finally met someone I love, someone who was far away for a long time."
<es>

@171
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, someone you love... Wait, isn't that supposed to be me?"
<es>

@172
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Haha. Are you jealous?"
<es>

@173
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not really..."
<es>

@174
<en>I pretended to pout, looking at Mizuki's radiant smile.
<es>

@175
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi! Hold here!!"
<es>

@176
<en>Mizuki pulled my hand over to one of the dolphins' fins and I grabbed it.
<es>

@177
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hold on tight! Don't let go!"
<es>

@178
<en>Mizuki left that dorsal fin to me and moved over to the other dolphin.
<es>

@179
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wowwww!!"
<es>

@180
<en>The water splashed me on the face like millions of tiny pebbles hitting me at amazing speed.
<es>

@181
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi! Take a deep breath!"
<es>

@182
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!? Haaaaaah..."
<es>

@183
<en>All of a sudden I was pulled beneath the surface.
<es>

@184
<en>Splash!!
<es>

@188
<en>Wooow!?
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n(God! My eyes! My eyes hurt!)
<es>

@190
<en>But my panic only lasted a moment.
<es>

@191
<en>{Mizuki}\n(See?)
<es>

@192
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Oh, my god!! It's so beautiful!!)
<es>

@193
<en>Mizuki and I communicated through our body language. I'm not sure if I got my message across, but I was pretty sure she knew that I was damn excited.
<es>

@194
<en>This was my first time seeing the ocean from within. It was a totally different world from land. Now I got why Mizuki was so attracted to it.
<es>

@195
<en>The sea looked a bit different from other ones down here in the south - the water wasn't the usual shade of emerald green.
<es>

@196
<en>It was blue. A pure blue. It looked more like space than the ocean.
<es>

@197
<en>All I saw was blue in all ways, numbing my sense of direction. The only thing I know is that brightness means up.
<es>

@198
<en>It looks pretty deep down the bottom. The clear blue led down into a deeper ultramarine, then finally into a dark world without color.
<es>

@199
<en>As I peered down into that abyss, an instinctual terror began to attack me.
<es>

@200
<en>{Mizuki}\n"~!"
<es>

@201
<en>However, Mizuki held my hand tight. I could even feel her sense of bliss from her hand.
<es>

@202
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREE*
<es>

@203
<en>The dolphins danced around us as we swam with our hands together.
<es>

@204
<en>{Mizuki}\n"~!"
<es>

@205
<en>As Mizuki bobbed her head with a smile, I answered with a nod.
<es>

@206
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREE*
<es>

@207
<en>It seemed like the dolphins smiled back to us. This was an absolutely life-changing experience.
<es>

@212
<en>Mizuki was still excited on the way home.
<es>

@215
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The dolphins were so adorable! Look at my hands. I really touched them with my hands!"
<es>

@216
<en>She kept on talking about the dolphins like a little kid.
<es>

@217
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But it was amazingly beautiful under the sea. I never knew."
<es>

@220
<en>{Mizuki}\n"This island is a very special place. I don't think there are many waters out there with this beauty."
<es>

@221
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? I was just blown away today."
<es>

@222
<en>Honestly, I feel very lucky I can swim now. I've never been interested in the sea until today.
<es>

@225
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Glad to hear you finally understand some of what makes the sea great."
<es>

@226
<en>Now I feel that, perhaps, I only knew about part of Mizuki because I didn't understand the greatness of the ocean.
<es>

@227
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe I should get a scuba license."
<es>

@228
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Haha. You're on a roll, Kazushi."
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why haven't you ever gotten a scuba license?"
<es>

@232
<en>{Mizuki}\n"If you want one then I'll do it with you. I was gonna get one someday, but never really did because I figured I could get it at any time."
<es>

@233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? I'd have thought you'd be more interested than most."
<es>

@234
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I do, but it's not really what gets me going. I love being able to touch the water, so I don't want to have too much stuff on me."
<es>

@235
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's a silly point to fuss over, but I want to face the sea with my own ability, and just as I was born."
<es>

@236
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm, I didn't know you had your own sticking point about it."
<es>

@239
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, I can get really picky when it comes to swimming. Anyways, I had a really great time today - I can genuinely put it down as one of my historic days."
<es>

@240
<en>At first it sounded like she was exaggerating a bit, but come to think of it, I'd have to agree that today made a major impact for her.
<es>

@241
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I wonder if the dolphins will come here again. I want to show them to our friends."
<es>

@242
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They'll come back if they like it here."
<es>

@245
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah. I hope they do."
<es>

@246
<en>Mizuki talked with her eyes sparkling, as if she were missing a boyfriend who lived far away from her. I felt a bit jealous.
<es>

@247
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Good things have kept happening since you gave this to me, Kazushi."
<es>

@248
<en>Mizuki pulled the necklace out of her shirt. It's the pendant I bought for her at Miya-san's store.
<es>

@249
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, you're wearing that, huh?"
<es>

@252
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Of course. This is one of my most important things right now."
<es>

@253
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@254
<en>I felt shy when I heard that. I was so selfish, and all my envy of the dolphins blew away.
<es>

@255
<en>People really are a selfish lot.
<es>

@256
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Maybe this stone made it possible for me to see the dolphins."
<es>

@257
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The stone?"
<es>

@260
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The pendant is made from a special stone native to the island, right? And wasn't it really expensive?"
<es>

@261
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya-san also said the stone is some kind of a lucky charm, or something."
<es>

@262
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, this stone may have the power to grant our wishes."
<es>

@263
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know."
<es>

@264
<en>I'm not sure if such a convenient stone exists, but if Mizuki wants to believe it then I'm not going to argue.
<es>

@267
<en>{Mizuki}\n"If it's clear tomorrow, then why don't we go there again with everyone together? I really want them to see the dolphins."
<es>

@268
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good idea. I hope it's sunny again tomorrow."
<es>

@271
<en>Unfortunately, it stormed the next day.
<es>

@276
<en>{Appo}\n"We should cancel it today."
<es>

@277
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, who'd have thought it'd rain."
<es>

@278
<en>Mizuki must be disappointed. This storm sure rained on her parade.
<es>

@279
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, the sea isn't gonna disappear, so we don't have to be so discouraged."
<es>

@282
<en>{Appo}\n"???\nOf course the sea won't disappear. What are you talking about?"
<es>

@283
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shut up. What does it matter?"
<es>

@284
<en>I don't know why, but I had a bad feeling about this. That's why I was desperately trying to tell myself nothing was wrong.
<es>

@285
<en>But what could go wrong?
<es>

@286
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm going out for a while."
<es>

@287
<en>Something told me to go and check on her.
<es>

@288
<en>{Appo}\n"Where are you planning to go in the middle of this storm? It's dangerous outside!"
<es>

@289
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm going to check the ocean. I'll be right back!"
<es>

@290
<en>{Appo}\n"The ocean of all places? Just make sure you don't go too close, alright?"
<es>

@291
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. See you later."
<es>

@296
<en>First, I went and checked the girls' dorm.
<es>

@299
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What a storm. It's such a shame."
<es>

@300
<en>Mizuki was in her room at the dorm. I thought she might have gone to the sea alone. Good. I feel greatly relieved.
<es>

@303
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So, what's the matter?"
<es>

@304
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're gonna stay inside all today, right?"
<es>

@305
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, I was going to. Oh, what, are you planning to barge into my room for the day?"
<es>

@308
<en>{Mizuki}\n"If so, it's not gonna happen. The boys aren't allowed here, you know? Although, a certain friend of yours whose name starts with an 'A' sneaks in here all the time."
<es>

@309
<en>That's Appo. Sooner or later he's going to be in big trouble for that. That said, maybe he does need to get in trouble before he learns his lesson...
<es>

@312
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Would you like to come up for a bit, Kazushi? A short while should be fine. Oh, but no sex, got it?"
<es>

@313
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's fine, I'll pass on that. Since it's raining like this, I think I'm gonna go play with the guys in our room."
<es>

@314
<en>I knew Mizuki would follow me if I said I was going to check the oceans for the dolphins, but I won't need her as I'm coming right back.
<es>

@317
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, I see. I understand building brotherhood is important sometimes."
<es>

@318
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You got it."
<es>

@321
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'll stay here today and have a good time bonding with the girls, myself."
<es>

@322
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that sounds good. I think I'd rather join that."
<es>

@325
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No way. You'll see them at lunch, right?"
<es>

@326
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's right. Let's get together then."
<es>

@327
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Okay."
<es>

@328
<en>Let's just finish up what's bugging me and go get lucky with Mizuki. Yup, that sounds good.
<es>

@334
<en>The ocean waves rolled high. I couldn't seen in front me because of them.
<es>

@335
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is crazy..."
<es>

@336
<en>It's a totally different ocean from the peaceful one I saw yesterday. It's no longer a serene blue in color, but a thick, muddy grey color of loneliness and longing.
<es>

@337
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I doubt they are coming on such a day."
<es>

@338
<en>The waves were wild. Even dolphins wouldn't come all the way out on a day like this. And if they haven't, then that's fine.
<es>

@339
<en>In fact, that'd be better.
<es>

@340
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's that?"
<es>

@341
<en>I saw a boat rocking amongst the waves. It was a fishing boat that must have broken free from its mooring. The ship's bow had run aground against the rocks.
<es>

@342
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This looks bad. It drifted all the way here on those waves?"
<es>

@343
<en>It might be best to go warn somebody soon. It could be big trouble if it drifts away again and crashes somewhere else.
<es>

@344
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah...!"
<es>

@345
<en>I could a glimpse of something hidden amidst the rolling waves.
<es>

@346
<en>Normally I would have completely overlooked it, but I just barely caught sight of it as I focused on the sea.
<es>

@347
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The dolphin from yesterday?"
<es>

@348
<en>I squinted my eyes. It did look like the dolphin from yesterday, but I could only see one.
<es>

@349
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's dangerous today. Did he come alone?"
<es>

@350
<en>I suppose that happens sometimes, but I felt a nagging anxiety.
<es>

@351
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is he looking for there?"
<es>

@352
<en>The dolphin wasn't moving very far, just swimming around in circles.
<es>

@353
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is there something out there?"
<es>

@354
<en>The dolphin bobbed up and down in the water trying to look at something far away. What is going on?
<es>

@356
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah...!"
<es>

@357
<en>He was looking at a corner of the rocks, right beside the grounded boat. The other dolphin was right there.
<es>

@358
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is the other one doing there?"
<es>

@359
<en>The other dolphin was left behind in that little inlet by the rocks.
<es>

@360
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The fishing boat must be blocking it in!"
<es>

@361
<en>The narrow entrance to the inlet was blocked off by the grounded boat, and the dolphin was trapped in that small area.
<es>

@362
<en>Furthermore, every time the fierce waves hit, the dolphin scraped its body against the rocks. It was trapped, unable to move or escape.
<es>

@363
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREE!*
<es>

@364
<en>I could faintly hear her cries of agony as she called for help amongst the rumbling of the storm.
<es>

@365
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This isn't good. I have to help her quick."
<es>

@366
<en>Her stamina was steadily wearing down. I had to get her out of there - fast.
<es>

@367
<en>Plus, that boat's dangerous too. If the dolphin gets hit by that thing, she'll be terribly injured.
<es>

@368
<en>Mizuki will be devastated if something bad happens to that dolphin. I've got to save her.
<es>

@369
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I need to get down there first."
<es>

@370
<en>Will I be alright going down there into such stormy waters? My legs were trembling as I looked at the raging scene below me.
<es>

@371
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, need any help?"
<es>

@372
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@381
<en>{Appo}\n"There you are."
<es>

@384
<en>{Daigo}\n"Huh? What's a dolphin doing down there?"
<es>

@385
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What the heck are you guys doing here?"
<es>

@386
<en>My three best friends were loaded down with all kinds of equipment like a rope and a shovel. Were they trying to save somebody?
<es>

@389
<en>{Pierre}\n"We thought you might be in trouble, so here we are with these."
<es>

@392
<en>{Appo}\n"It looks like you weren't in trouble yet, but these should help, right?"
<es>

@393
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Absolutely!! Thanks!"
<es>

@400
<en>{Daigo}\n"This is dangerous... This place is dangerous..."
<es>

@401
<en>It was enough to make a big guy like Daigo wimp out. Obviously there was a huge force of nature overwhelming us, like a monster on a rampage.
<es>

@405
<en>{Pierre}\n"Let's save her quickly and head back. They said it's going to get even fiercer soon."
<es>

@410
<en>{Daigo}\n"Take this rope and tie your bodies to it."
<es>

@411
<en>We bound ourselves together with the rope and tied its end to the handrail on the stairs.
<es>

@418
<en>{Appo}\n"But this is a pretty big dolphin. How are we gonna get her out of there?"
<es>

@419
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We'll just have to move the fishing boat and clear the way out."
<es>

@420
<en>Luckily, the boat was rocking around on the strong waves, so it must be pretty wobbly by now.
<es>

@421
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah. Maybe we could do it."
<es>

@422
<en>We could do it by taking advantage of the current from the rocking waves.
<es>

@423
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We just need to push it in the same direction as the waves. But..."
<es>

@424
<en>That's where it takes the full brunt of the waves. If a big wave happened to come, then we might get swallowed into the ocean.
<es>

@425
<en>{Kazushi}\n"S-scary... We might die."
<es>

@426
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREEEEEEEE*
<es>

@427
<en>We heard her heartrending cries.
<es>

@428
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...............We're going to be fine. We'll make it. I'm a better swimmer now."
<es>

@429
<en>I'm gonna be okay even if I fall in the water. I'm okay. I'm okay.
<es>

@430
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Here we go!"
<es>

@431
<en>We've got to save her.
<es>

@432
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREEEEE*
<es>

@433
<en>The dolphin cried out as if she was asking us for help.
<es>

@434
<en>The waves continued beating the dolphin against the rocks.
<es>

@437
<en>{Pierre}\n"We're coming to get you out of there!"
<es>

@440
<en>{Daigo}\n"All right, push!!"
<es>

@441
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hoooooo!!"
<es>

@442
<en>We pushed on the fishing boat all together in one go. Then, if we just push harder when the waves strike, then the water should take it from there.
<es>

@447
<en>{Appo}\n"Yaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!"
<es>

@448
<en>With such direct focus, I feel like I'm not even hearing the sound of the storm.
<es>

@449
<en>WHOOOOOOOO
<es>

@450
<en>Then I heard the rumbling sounds. A big wave was coming.
<es>

@452
<en>SPLASH!
<es>

@457
<en>{Pierre}\n"Woaaahh!!"
<es>

@458
<en>A huge wave crashed over our heads. At that moment, the boat began to rock with the receding current.
<es>

@459
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Now!"
<es>

@466
<en>{Boys}\n"Hoooooooohhhhh!!"
<es>

@467
<en>We pushed the fishing boat with all our strength.
<es>

@468
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hoooooooohhhhh!!"
<es>

@469
<en>As the waves receded, the boat began to list away. We pushed against it with all our might in that direction.
<es>

@471
<en>Creak...
<es>

@472
<en>The boat moved.
<es>

@473
<en>We pushed it even harder, and once it started moving, it borrowed the force of the waves and budged rather easily.
<es>

@474
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Go!!"
<es>

@479
<en>Creak...creak... WHOM!!
<es>

@480
<en>The fishing boat blocking he dolphin's exit drifted away with the waves. In no time, the trapped dolphin swam out of the inlet and into the ocean.
<es>

@481
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREEEE*
<es>

@482
<en>She must have been happy to see her friend again. The two dolphins looked like they were cuddling and kissing each other.
<es>

@485
<en>{Daigo}\n"W-we did it!"
<es>

@486
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you okay?! Are you hurt?!"
<es>

@488
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREEEE*
<es>

@489
<en>She looked good. But if she stayed here by the rocks too long, it was quite likely the same thing would happen again.
<es>

@490
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, you two get out of here now! Go away!!"
<es>

@491
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREEE*
<es>

@492
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKRRREEEEEE*
<es>

@493
<en>The two dolphins cried out together like they were thanking us for our rescue efforts.
<es>

@496
<en>{Appo}\n"They're so adorable. I've never seen a dolphin this close."
<es>

@501
<en>{Pierre}\n"Me too. Can I touch it?"
<es>

@502
<en>After rescuing the dolphin, we had completely let our guard down.
<es>

@503
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah...!"
<es>

@518
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi!"
<es>

@521
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm? He's not here? He said he was gonna come back and play in his room."
<es>

@522
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Did he go somewhere? Certainly not to pick up girls?"
<es>

@525
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No way, not in this weather. Then, where...?\n...Oh, maybe..."
<es>

@534
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@535
<en>It wasn't that big a wave, but we'd let our guard down.
<es>

@536
<en>Our feet got swept away by the wave and we all lost our balance.
<es>

@537
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wah!!"
<es>

@538
<en>I desperately clung to the nearest rock.
<es>

@541
<en>{Daigo}\n"Ah, wah!!"
<es>

@542
<en>The wave was carrying Daigo's big body away.
<es>

@547
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, grab on!!"
<es>

@548
<en>Daigo grabbed Pierre's hand. Then Appo followed suit.
<es>

@555
<en>{Appo}\n"Daigo, you're fucking heavy!!"
<es>

@556
<en>{Daigo}\n"If I live through this then I'll go on a diet!"
<es>

@557
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We're holding you to that!!"
<es>

@558
<en>Pierre and Appo grabbed onto a nearby rock and tried pulling me and Daigo back in using the rope around our waists.
<es>

@564
<en>{Pierre & Appo}\n"Pull! Pull! Pull!"
<es>

@565
<en>They pulled Daigo's hands as hard as they could and his body gradually rose up from under water. Just a little more!
<es>

@566
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wowwww!!"
<es>

@567
<en>They made their final pull, but my rope hung against the rocks like a pulley, and putting their strength into it proved my undoing.
<es>

@574
<en>Snap!!
<es>

@575
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?!"
<es>

@578
<en>The rope in my hands went limp. It had rubbed against the sharp edge of the rocks and snapped. I felt like I was being hurled through the air.
<es>

@579
<en>I lost all sense of direction.
<es>

@580
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wah! Aahhh!!"
<es>

@581
<en>My body slammed against something hard as it was hurled about in the water.
<es>

@582
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haah..."
<es>

@588
<en>It was a good thing I caught a quick breath. As I fell into the sea, I held my breath and curled up.
<es>

@589
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh..."
<es>

@590
<en>I felt myself losing all sense of direction again as I was tossed around in the undersea currents. I could feel myself plunging into the abyss, though.
<es>

@591
<en>And I could tell I was going down as my ears began to pop.
<es>

@592
<en>{Kazushi}\n(This is not good...)
<es>

@593
<en>An incredible sense of fear welled up from within. I was falling to the dark bottom of the sea.
<es>

@602
<en>{Appo}\n"Hey, Kazushi!"
<es>

@607
<en>{Pierre}\n"Kazushi! Come back!!"
<es>

@614
<en>{Daigo}\n"I-I'll go and get him."
<es>

@615
<en>{Pierre}\n"Stop it! You're gonna drown!"
<es>

@616
<en>The three guys were arguing in panic with each other until Mizuki showed up.
<es>

@622
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you guys doing here? It's too dangerous out here now!"
<es>

@627
<en>{Appo}\n"Mizuki-chan!"
<es>

@628
<en>Mizuki looked around.
<es>

@631

<es>

@635
<en>{Pierre}\n"He..."
<es>

@639

<es>

@642
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What!"
<es>

@643
<en>Mizuki turned pale from the shock.
<es>

@644
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi...Kazushi!!"
<es>

@649
<en>{Appo}\n"Daigo, don't panic!!"
<es>

@651
<en>Appo and Pierre were holding Daigo down, but Mizuki didn't even see. Her eyes were staring at the raging sea in fright.
<es>

@654
<en>{Mizuki}\n"When? When did it happen?"
<es>

@659
<en>{Pierre}\n"U-umm... just now. Not too long ago."
<es>

@662
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Okay... Yes, then he should be fine. He'll be fine. Kazushi's able to swim 50 meters now."
<es>

@666
<en>{Appo}\n"But, we can't just leave him..."
<es>

@669
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm going in."
<es>

@674
<en>{Pierre}\n"What? Mizuki-chan, no..."
<es>

@678
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@681
<en>Mizuki dove into the raging seas.
<es>

@684
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey!!"
<es>

@689
<en>{Appo}\n"This is bad!"
<es>

@693
<en>{Daigo}\n"Hmm? Is this...?"
<es>

@694
<en>Daigo picked up something that washed up by his foot: a necklace with a beautiful stone pendant.
<es>

@700
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Ngggmmmm!!)
<es>

@701
<en>I was tossed about by the current, unable to tell what was going on anymore. All I could do was hold my breath and keep from taking in water.
<es>

@702
<en>{Kazushi}\n(I-I'm gonna die!)
<es>

@703
<en>At this rate, I was going to die. For the first time, the true fear of death struck me.

@704
<en>*skree, skree*

@705
<en>I heard something familiar at that moment.
<es>

@706

@707
<en>Yoink!
<es>

@708
<en>{Kazushi}\n"!!?"
<es>

@709

<es>

@710
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREEEE*
<es>

@711
<en>It's the dolphin. He was lifting me up with my collar in its mouth.
<es>

@712
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKRREEEEE*
<es>

@713
<en>His strong force pulled me up, up and up.

@714
<en>{Mizuki}\n"!!!"
<es>

@715
<en>Ah! Mizuki! Mizuki swam over to me along with the other dolphin.
<es>

@716
<en>Yank!
<es>

@717
<en>Mizuki grabbed me by the arm. I'm saved...
<es>

@723
<en>{Kazushi}\n *Bwech!*
<es>

@724
<en>At last, I reached the ground. It was the edge of the rocky stretch, a good ways away from where I fell.
<es>

@727
<en>{Daigo}\n"Ah! Kazushi!!"
<es>

@729
<en>The guys were running over to me but it was still quite a distance.
<es>

@732

<es>

@733
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay!"
<es>

@734
<en>I clung onto a rock and pulled myself up.
<es>

@735
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haaagh!"
<es>

@736
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hnnnngh!!"
<es>

@738
<en>Mizuki pushed me by my ass, helping me climb up.
<es>

@740
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki! Grab my hand!!"
<es>

@741
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Okay!!"
<es>

@742

<en>{Kazushi}\n"Aah!"
<es>

@744
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uaah!"
<es>

@745

<es>

@747

@750
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh...? The boat!!"
<es>

@751

<es>

@752
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Come on! Hurry up!!"

<en>*SMASH...*
<es>

@765
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@766

@785

<es>

@787
<en>{Doctor}\n"This is terrible... Take her inside! We'll perform surgery right away!"
<es>

@788

@792

<es>

@803

<es>

@804
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No... I can't believe this."
<es>

@805
<en>This was a bad joke. I could almost laugh at it.
<es>

@806
<en>{Doctor}\n"I'll have Miya-san explain the rest to you."
<es>

@809
<en>For some reason, Miya-san took over for the doctor. I wondered why a general store's old man was here, but apparently he was summoned as an alchemist.
<es>

@811
<en>{Miya}\n"Mizuki-chan will never be able to move her legs again."
<es>

@812
<en>Miya-san said the same thing as the doctor. It didn't make any sense.
<es>

@813
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean?"
<es>

@814
<en>The doctor and Miya-san both look perplexed. But I just don't understand it.
<es>

@815
<en>Or maybe I just refuse to understand what they're saying. How can I accept what they are saying?
<es>

@816
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, that's not true. Miya-san, why are you saying that?"
<es>

@819
<en>{Miya}\n"That was the doctor's diagnosis. That's why he asked me to come here as an alchemist."
<es>

@820
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What would an alchemist...?"
<es>

@821
<en>{Miya}\n"On this island, medicine and alchemy are closely linked with each other. The alchemist supports the doctor, and the doctor assists the alchemist."
<es>

@822
<en>{Miya}\n"I have already retired as an alchemist, but I still want to help people, so I continue to study alchemy."
<es>

@823
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, Miya-san, can't you cure her? That's right! Can't you cure her with alchemy?"
<es>

<en>Alchemy's just like magic - it's even believed to be capable of making someone ageless and immortal. If that's true, healing someone's legs should be a no-brainer, right?
<es>

@825
<en>But Miya-san shook his head.
<es>

@828
<en>{Miya}\n"Unfortunately, alchemy isn't perfect. Mizuki-chan's leg injuries are too severe. Her bones were completely shattered."
<es>

@829
<en>A picture of the accident just came to my mind. Her legs were bleeding profusely.
<es>

@830
<en>The image made me feel sick.
<es>

@831
<en>{Miya}\n"In fact, we nearly had to amputate. What I was able to do with alchemy was to repair the bones and skin that were crushed."
<es>

@832
<en>{Miya}\n"Their shape looks good, but I doubt they'll move for her."
<es>

@833
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No..."
<es>

@834
<en>It was just yesterday she was swimming around in the sea. She was so happy with the dolphins.
<es>

@835
<en>{Miya}\n"Depending on the circumstances, it may be best to amputate and have artificial legs fitted. There's a chance she might be able to move more freely that way."
<es>

@836
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No..."
<es>

@840
<en>{Miya}\n"But we can think about that once things have calmed down. We can have the larger hospital on the mainland examine her, get a second opinion, and of course discuss the matter with Mizuki-chan herself..."
<es>

@842
<en>Almost none of Miya-san's explanations reached my mind. To me, they were just noise.
<es>

@843
<en>{Miya}\n"All we can do is to wait for her recovery."
<es>

@844
<en>There was only one thing bothering me...
<es>

@845
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Will Mizuki ever be able to swim again?"
<es>

@848
<en>Miya-san looks down and away. His painful expression told me the answer I did not want to hear.
<es>

@849
<en>{Miya}\n"Not as she is now. However, she may able to swim to some degree with artificial legs."
<es>

@850
<en>My sight was covered in red as I heard those words. Rage with no outlet welled up within me.
<es>

@851
<en>{Kazushi}\n"To some degree..."
<es>

@852
<en>To some degree isn't enough. She has to be able to freely swim the seven seas with the dolphins!
<es>

@853
<en>God gave her the ability to swim. It's a divine gift, and I just couldn't bear to think of her losing it.
<es>

@854
<en>But they said Mizuki would never swim again.
<es>

@855
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't fuck with me..."
<es>

@856
<en>I began to mutter from the anger welling up within me.
<es>

@859
<en>{Miya}\n"Pardon?"
<es>

@860
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I said don't fuck with me!"
<es>

@861
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm telling you, don't fuck with me!"
<es>

@862
<en>I grabbed Miya-san by the collar and rammed him against the wall.
<es>

@868
<en>{Miya}\n"Ugh...!!"
<es>

@869
<en>Miya-san let out a grunt as his back hit the wall. I stared into Miya-san's eyes through the glasses hanging off his face and they blurred.
<es>

@872
<en>{Miya}\n"Haruma-kun..."
<es>

@873
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why did this have to happen to Mizuki-chan?! Tell me what she's done wrong?!"
<es>

@874
<en>That's right. Mizuki didn't do anything wrong. There is no reason for her to have to face this.
<es>

@875
<en>Why is she getting such horrible treatment?!
<es>

@876
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't fuck with me! Fix her damn legs! Please!!"
<es>

@879
<en>{Miya}\n"But..."
<es>

@880
<en>Miya-san fell silent, which pissed me off even more.
<es>

@881
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're an alchemist, aren't you?! Alchemists are supposed to fucking help people, aren't they?! Then fix her!"
<es>

@882
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will do anything! Anything..."
<es>

@884
<en>I could hardly see anything through the tears. I felt my hands letting go of Miya-san as I dropped to my knees.
<es>

@885
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please... I will do anything... I don't need anything else..."
<es>

@888
<en>{Miya}\n"Haruma-kun..."
<es>

@889
<en>I found myself crawling on the floor. Miya-san gently laid his arm across my arched back. His lip was bleeding from when he hit the wall.
<es>

@890
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry..."
<es>

@891
<en>{Miya}\n"That's okay. I am sorry I can't be of any help..."
<es>

@892
<en>I know. No one is to blame. And the one who will suffer most is...
<es>

@893
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does Mizuki know about this?"
<es>

@896
<en>{Miya}\n"No, not yet. The medicine we gave to relieve her pain is still in effect. She probably won't wake up at all today."
<es>

@897
<en>{Miya}\n"In two or three days, the pain should go away. Once the pain is gone and she's off the medicine, she should become fully aware."
<es>

@898
<en>{Miya}\n"That's when we will tell Mizuki-chan about her legs."
<es>

@899
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@900
<en>It's going to be excruciating for anyone to tell her that her legs will no longer move. But we can't keep it a secret from her. Who should be the one to tell her, then...?
<es>

@901
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll tell her."
<es>

@902
<en>{Miya}\n"What?"
<es>

@903
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will tell her about her legs."
<es>

@904
<en>{Miya}\n"But this is very harsh job..."
<es>

@905
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know, but she's the one who's going to suffer most."
<es>

@906
<en>The one who will really suffer is Mizuki. No one can bear it for her.
<es>

@907
<en>I would love to take her place. But unfortunately, I know that's impossible.
<es>

@908
<en>But that's why I wanted to at least bear some of the pain with her.
<es>

@909
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will tell Mizuki."
<es>

@912
<en>{Miya}\n"...Okay. Please do."
<es>

@913
<en>This was horrible. I felt like I was still dreaming. Was everything up to yesterday just a dream? Or did the dream just start?
<es>

@914
<en>I wished everything was just a dream. But tomorrow, reality will sink in... tomorrow, when I have to tell the truth to Mizuki.
<es>

@922
<en>The next day...
<es>

@923
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Man, talk about pathetic. Hospitalized by an accident at sea."
<es>

@925
<en>When I went to visit Mizuki, she was bright and cheerful. Just as Miya-san said, she wasn't feeling any pain anymore. Right after the accident, she went unconscious and remained asleep until the pain was gone.
<es>

@927
<en>I was thankful that at least she wouldn't have to suffer physical pain.
<es>

@928
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Were you okay, Kazushi? You're okay, right?"
<es>

@929
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I was fine. I got off with just a few scratches... thanks to you."
<es>

@930
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Good. Otherwise, my injuries would be pointless, right?"
<es>

@931
<en>Her voice was so cheerful. It was a mystery that she could be so bright. I almost wondered if she'd been cured.
<es>

@932
<en>Maybe Miya-san's alchemy had worked better than he thought, and she had completely recovered...
<es>

@933
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How are you feeling?"
<es>

@934
<en>I was afraid to ask her. I felt like doing so would wake me from this happy dream.
<es>

@935
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Not bad... I can't believe I slept the whole day."
<es>

@936
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? So everything feels okay?"
<es>

@938
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Umm, my legs are a bit strange."
<es>

@939
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Legs?"
<es>

@940
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't move them at all. There's no feeling in them. Is that because of the pain killer or anesthesia?"
<es>

@941
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@942
<en>I found myself thrown into darkness. Her legs hadn't been cured, and this was definitely not a dream.
<es>

@943
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi...\nDid the doctor tell you anything about my legs?"
<es>

@944
<en>I could see the anxiety hidden in her eyes. I should be the one driving her fears away, but I'm the one who has to make her suffer more.
<es>

@945
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, Kazushi?"
<es>

@946
<en>My silence was just exacerbating her fears.
<es>

@948
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Mizuki. Calm down and listen to me."
<es>

@949
<en>My voice may have been shaking. Mizuki's expression drew dark.
<es>

@950
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What is it? You are not gonna propose to me now, are you? It's a little too early."
<es>

@951
<en>She said it with a mischievous look and that's when I knew.
<es>

@952
<en>Mizuki's already caught on that something's wrong.
<es>

@953
<en>Mizuki didn't usually joke like this. She must have realized it, but somewhere she still held out hope.
<es>

@954
<en>And I had to rob her of that hope.
<es>

@955
<en>{Kazushi}\n"About your legs..."
<es>

@956
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, so did the doctor say something? What is going on? I don't feel anything in them."
<es>

@957
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It feels like these aren't really my legs. They're going to be cured, though, right? How long's it gonna take?"
<es>

@958
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That..."
<es>

@959
<en>I couldn't look her straight in the eye. She believed that I won't say anything horrible and her eyes were filled with that absolute trust.
<es>

@960
<en>And now I have to betray her trust in me.
<es>

@961
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Your legs..."
<es>

@962
<en>How do I tell her? I've been thinking all day since yesterday about how to say it. But I'm still dumbstruck and speechless.
<es>

@963
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So it's that bad?"
<es>

@964
<en>Mizuki's tone plummeted. My silence was making her worry even more. I have to tell her...
<es>

@965
<en>But once I tell her...
<es>

@966
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah... it's pretty bad."
<es>

@967
<en>I clenched my teeth as I answered.
<es>

@968
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How long will it take? Is rehab going to be difficult? But they will move like normal again, right?"
<es>

@969
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...It seems not."
<es>

@970
<en>{Mizuki}\n"............What?"
<es>

@971
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They said that with the way it is now, your legs will never move again."
<es>

@972
<en>The silence embraced us momentarily. Then, Mizuki smiled and laughed back at me.
<es>

@973
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You're joking, right!?"
<es>

@974
<en>I have no idea what to tell her. I wanted to say they will be cured, but...
<es>

@975
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@976
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I see. It's true."
<es>

@977
<en>Maybe it hasn't really hit her yet, because instead of crying, she's still got a bit of a smile.
<es>

@978
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They said it would be good to get checked out at the big hospital on the mainland. They might be able to find a treatment."
<es>

@979
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, okay... But I don't get it. Why?"
<es>

@980
<en>{Mizuki}\n"There's not a single scratch on them. Why is that bad?"
<es>

@981
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya-san used alchemy to fix your legs cosmetically, but..."
<es>

@982
<en>{Mizuki}\n"He couldn't make them move..."
<es>

@983
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. It was no good."
<es>

@984
<en>Mizuki kept silent for a while. I couldn't say anything either because what else was there for me to say to her?
<es>

@985
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't swim anymore, can I?"
<es>

@986
<en>Those were the words she muttered.
<es>

@987
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right now... they're not certain."
<es>

@988
<en>I gave her a vague answer, but Mizuki understood what I meant.
<es>

@989
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I see."
<es>

@990
<en>Mizuki lied on her back, covering her eyes with her hands. She fell still.
<es>

@991
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@992
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry. I need time..."
<es>

@993
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......Sure."
<es>

@995
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@996
<en>Mizuki remained still for a while.
<es>

@997
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I see... I can't swim any more, huh..."
<es>

@998
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@999
<en>I put my hand on her shoulder. Then Mizuki held my hand.
<es>

@1000
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Please... hold my hand."
<es>

@1001
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah."
<es>

@1002
<en>I held her hand tight. Mizuki held mine back just as tightly.
<es>

@1003
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I see... Who'd have thought this would happen? If I'd known, I would've gone swimming a bit more."
<es>

@1004
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@1005
<en>I couldn't help but hold her tightly with both arms. Her body felt empty and soulless, like sorrow had consumed her being.
<es>

@1006
<en>No matter how much I hugged her, it still felt like she was empty, so I held her tighter.
<es>

@1007
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, too tight..."
<es>

@1008
<en>Then, Mizuki put her arms around me and hugged me really tight.
<es>

@1009
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I...I..."
<es>

@1010
<en>"I am going to get your legs to move." That's what I really wanted to say to her, but I didn't have that power.
<es>

@1011
<en>I'm just a student. I am not a doctor, nor an alchemist. All I can do is to tell her the truth: the cold, brutal truth.
<es>

@1012
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry..."
<es>

@1013
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Don't make that face, Kazushi. There's no reason for you to apologize. It's not your fault."
<es>

@1014
<en>That day, Mizuki never cried nor complained.
<es>

@1015
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Please come see me tomorrow."
<es>

@1016
<en>She has every right to hold a grudge against me for what happened to her, but she just asked me to come and visit her again. I gave her a smile as that's all I could do.
<es>

@1017
<en>Is there anything I can do for Mizuki?
<es>

@1024
<en>{Miya}\n"I see. You told her, huh? Good work."
<es>

@1025
<en>I stopped by Miya-san's since I didn't want to go straight home.
<es>

@1026
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki just kept smiling. I know she must be terribly hurt and sad."
<es>

@1027
<en>{Miya}\n"It probably doesn't feel real to her yet. But the fact that she is no longer able to walk will gradually torture her."
<es>

@1028
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right."
<es>

@1029
<en>Every time Mizuki goes to do anything, she will be confronted with the reality that her legs won't move.
<es>

@1030
<en>{Miya}\n"There will be more pain and more sorrow as she lives each day. That will be when Mizuki-chan needs your support most, Haruma-kun."
<es>

@1031
<en>{Miya}\n"You are the only one that can support her, Haruma-kun."
<es>

@1032
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Will I be able to do that? No, no matter what happens, I'll stay by Mizuki's side. But, will I be any support to her?"
<es>

@1035
<en>{Miya}\n"When I was treating her legs in the hospital, Mizuki-chan was calling your name in her sleep."
<es>

@1036
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My name?"
<es>

@1037
<en>{Miya}\n"She was the one in pain, and yet she was worried for your safety. It was all in her sleep, though."
<es>

@1038
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see..."
<es>

@1039
<en>Mizuki was worried about me, not herself. What a pathetic man I am! I let her go through this...
<es>

@1040
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I go to see Mizuki tomorrow?"
<es>

@1041
<en>All I can do for Mizuki is to be with her. I can listen and share her pain.
<es>

@1042
<en>{Miya}\n"Of course. Go visit her every day. She must feel quite lonely."
<es>

@1043
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes. I will."
<es>

@1044
<en>{Miya}\n"She may be really down tomorrow. Be sure to support her."
<es>

@1045
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes."
<es>

@1046
<en>I vowed to live my life for her. I would do anything for her - even anything that seems impossible to do.
<es>

@1051
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ugh... I am so hungry."
<es>

@1052
<en>Mizuki seemed fine the next day as well. She was complaining about being hungry.
<es>

@1053
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What would you want to eat?"
<es>

@1054
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm? Something good."
<es>

@1055
<en>A quick answer.
<es>

@1056
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The meals are terrible here. There's no need for a small clinic to mimic a big hospital, let alone their bad food."
<es>

@1057
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think they're imitating it. So you want something good to eat? Then I'll cook it for you!"
<es>

@1058
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Geh?!"
<es>

@1059
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What do you mean 'Geh'?"
<es>

@1060
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well..."
<es>

@1061
<en>Oh, I know what she wants to say. She doesn't think anything I cook is worth eating.
<es>

@1062
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right, I'll go and fix you something for lunch. I hope they'll let me use their kitchen here..."
<es>

@1063
<en>I'll show her my hidden strength. My one and only signature dish - my Lethal Weapon.
<es>

@1064
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You're going to fix my lunch today? There's not enough time, Kazushi."
<es>

@1065
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It won't take long. Just an hour is enough to make it."
<es>

@1066
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, not for you. For me to brace myself..."
<es>

@1067
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about? Just hold on, and I will get you the best meal you've ever tasted in your life."
<es>

@1068
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh... Kazushi... Don't be so desperate."
<es>

@1069
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You just wait, with your stomach empty! I'm going to bring you to tears!"
<es>

@1072
<en>{Mizuki}\n"This is good..."
<es>

@1073
<en>Mizuki seems stunned.
<es>

@1074
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good, huh? I am pretty good at making omurice."
<es>

@1075
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You can never judge a book by its cover, huh? I never knew you had such skill."
<es>

@1076
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, it's limited to omurice..."
<es>

@1077
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's good just like you said, but this is bad. If you're better than me..."
<es>

@1078
<en>"Then what am I supposed to do?" she muttered.
<es>

@1079
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't tell me you can't cook, Mizuki?"
<es>

@1080
<en>I'd seen her in the kitchen before, but...
<es>

@1081
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Of course I can fix something. Next time I'll make... I guess I can't."
<es>

@1082
<en>She sneered at herself as she thought of her legs. She may have realized that it'll take some time before she stands in the kitchen again.
<es>

@1083
<en>No, she may never "stand" again at all.
<es>

@1084
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No rush, Mizuki. I shall wait and look forward to the day you cook for me."
<es>

@1085
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes. You're right. I'm gonna have to study cooking, then."
<es>

@1086
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Starting now?"
<es>

@1087
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can cook? I just meant as review."
<es>

@1088
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@1089
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Don't give me such a suspicious look."
<es>

@1090
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hahah, just getting even."
<es>

@1091
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Jeez, you're such a bad guy, Kazushi. This is why you're not popular."
<es>

@1092
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It doesn't matter as long as I'm popular with one special girl."
<es>

@1093
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Whoa..."
<es>

@1094
<en>Suddenly, both of us found ourselves speechless. That line I just said was too cool, and made me want to bite my tongue.
<es>

@1095
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1096
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh... Why don't you get some rest?"
<es>

@1097
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Y-yes... I will. What about you? Are you okay? You look a little tired."
<es>

@1098
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Me? I'm fine. I got enough sleep last night, and if I have to, I can go three days without sleep at all and still survive."
<es>

@1099
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Really? Well, if you get tired, you can sleep here with me, okay? But no sex."
<es>

@1100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, yes, I know."
<es>

@1101
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Good night."
<es>

@1103
<en>As I listened to Mizuki's quiet breathing in her sleep, I sighed with relief.
<es>

@1104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't be looking tired."
<es>

@1105
<en>I can't look tired in front of Mizuki. I have to keep smiling because Mizuki is trying to keep smiling.
<es>

@1106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not like me... huh?"
<es>

@1107
<en>That's it, I'll scribble on Mizuki's face. Yup, that's like me.
<es>

@1108
<en>..................
<es>

@1109
<en>............
<es>

@1110
<en>Later on, she became really mad at me...
<es>

@1115
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What do you mean, like you?! Jesus, you're not a kid, so think before you act!"
<es>

@1116
<en>She was still upset about yesterday.
<es>

@1117
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry."
<es>

@1118
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, give me your face. I got a marker from a nurse."
<es>

@1119
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Revenge?"
<es>

@1120
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes. Come on! Get your face close to me. I can't move, so don't run away!"
<es>

@1121
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Urk... that's not fair."
<es>

@1122
<en>I had to give in after that.
<es>

@1123
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's right. Stay quiet."
<es>

@1124
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh... Second thought! No!! I don't want it!"
<es>

@1125
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey! Don't run away!!"
<es>

@1126
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No! No way!"
<es>

@1128
<en>*rattlerattle*
<es>

@1129
<en>Suddenly, the door opened.
<es>

@1132
<en>{Pierre}\n"What are you guys doing?"
<es>

@1133
<en>{Appo}\n"You look better than I thought."
<es>

@1134
<en>It was the three guys.
<es>

@1135
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahahah...welcome."
<es>

@1136
<en>They entered in a rather hesitant manner, though they didn't knock first.
<es>

@1137
<en>{Pierre}\n"We heard you two screaming in here... Why 'Mizuki-chan is my life'?"
<es>

@1138
<en>He said, looking at my face.
<es>

@1139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's what you wrote? Aren't you embarrassed to write that?"
<es>

@1140
<en>{Mizuki}\n"S-shut up. Who cares?"
<es>

@1141
<en>{Daigo}\n"Silly lovebirds."
<es>

@1142
<en>{Appo}\n"Sheesh, you guys are embarrassing. Are there any other patients here?"
<es>

@1143
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There's no other patients, and this is a private room."
<es>

@1144
<en>{Daigo}\n"It's not a bad room."
<es>

@1145
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, it is pretty cozy."
<es>

@1146
<en>The three of them stepped in and Mizuki started acting quiet and calm.
<es>

@1147
<en>{Pierre}\n"Uh...are we interrupting something here?"
<es>

@1148
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, it's good that you guys came. Just knock first. You guys have no tact."
<es>

@1149
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahaha."
<es>

@1151
<en>Knock, knock...
<es>

@1152
<en>There was a knock this time.
<es>

@1154
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hello. We came for a visit."
<es>

@1155
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh? You guys are here, too."
<es>

@1156
<en>A few girls also came by to see Mizuki too. The population density just skyrocketed.
<es>

@1157
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All the visits overlapped, huh?"
<es>

@1158
<en>{Sakura}\n"We were all talking about how today might be good day to see Mizuki."
<es>

@1159
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wait, why's 'Mizuki is my life' written on your face?"
<es>

@1160
<en>All the girls then looked at my face.
<es>

@1161
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, Mizuki..."
<es>

@1162
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi just loves me so much that mysterious stigmata appear on his face."
<es>

@1163
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, guys, you weren't making out in the clinic or anything, were you?"
<es>

@1164
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, we're not!"
<es>

@1165
<en>{Appo}\n"We haven't done it in a hospital room. That might be good."
<es>

@1166
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What situation? What's good?"
<es>

@1167
<en>I hope he and Fuusen won't get hospitalized just for the wrong reason.
<es>

@1168
<en>{Rin}\n"Mizuki-chan, are you eating okay? Do you like the food here?"
<es>

@1169
<en>And Eiden Island's #1 Bride, Fujisaki-san, was worried about her diet.
<es>

@1170
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Honestly, not really. I'd rather eat Kazushi's omurice every day."
<es>

@1171
<en>{Sakura}\n"Harucchi's omurice? What, he made that for you?"
<es>

@1172
<en>{Rin}\n"Wow, Haruma-kun. You are so kind!"
<es>

@1173
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sort of tit for tat, you know?"
<es>

@1174
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The omurice was cheekily good."
<es>

@1175
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean, cheekily? Oh-ho? Are you jealous because you can't cook?"
<es>

@1176
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can too cook! Agh, sheesh. It's so frustrating that I can't just make something right now."
<es>

@1177
<en>Everyone around us looked astonished by our conversation and they all smile.
<es>

@1178
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahaha, you seem to be feeling good, Mizuki."
<es>

@1179
<en>{Pierre}\n"Right? If you're going that well, you should be able to attend next semester, right?"
<es>

@1180
<en>Our summer break was drawing to an end. In just a few more days the next semester would begin. However...
<es>

@1181
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahaha, I don't think I will be for a while."
<es>

@1183
<en>There's no telling when Mizuki will be able to return to school. She'll need a wheelchair, but it'll take time to prepare one on this isolated island, and she needs more examinations too.
<es>

@1185
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I may have to go to another hospital on the mainland."
<es>

@1186
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh, then does that mean you might be able to walk again?"
<es>

@1188
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1189
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@1190
<en>We all stood in stunned silence. Everyone knew about her legs, and that they wouldn't move again.
<es>

@1191
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wh-what?"
<es>

@1192
<en>{Ran}\n"Moron."
<es>

@1194
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's okay. They may be able to find a way to treat my legs. Who knows?"
<es>

@1195
<en>{Rin}\n"Yeah, that's right! If you go to a big university hospital, there might be some amazing doctor."
<es>

@1196
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's right. Medical science makes progress every day."
<es>

@1197
<en>{Appo}\n"Yeah. My grandpa was told by the local hospital that he only had three months to live, but after he went to a university hospital he was cured and home in three months."
<es>

@1198
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? That's a great story!"
<es>

@1199
<en>His story held hope for us. But if you get your hopes too high, the shock when they fall though is worse. It's hard to balance them.
<es>

@1200
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well, I won't be getting my hopes up too much. Besides, I know their food'll be worse than here."
<es>

@1201
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I might have trouble cooking for you at a big hospital, too."
<es>

@1202
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Even if I do go to one, Kazushi, you have class. You can't come to the mainland with me."
<es>

@1203
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm going if you are. Missing a few days of class isn't gonna kill me."
<es>

@1204
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It may not be just a few days."
<es>

@1205
<en>Mizuki might get transferred to a bigger hospital for treatment.
<es>

@1206
<en>I'll take her to America or Alaska or wherever if they can cure her legs, but according to Miya-san, the hopes were slim.
<es>

@1207
<en>{Haruka}\n"Can't you go outside?"
<es>

@1208
<en>{Mizuki}\n"They're getting me a wheelchair soon. Then I can go outside."
<es>

@1209
<en>{Rin}\n"When that day comes, let's go out and walk together. Okay?"
<es>

@1210
<en>{Ran}\n"That's a great idea! It's still hot outside now, but it'll cool down soon."
<es>

@1211
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah. Like you said, summer break's almost over."
<es>

@1212
<en>Our summer will soon be over. This was supposed to be a great summer, but why? Why did it have to turn so ugly?
<es>

@1213
<en>Everybody thought that way, and it cast us all into silence.
<es>

@1214
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, take me out for a walk when it cools down outside."
<es>

@1215
<en>Mizuki broke the silence with her cheerful acceptance.
<es>

@1216
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's a good idea."
<es>

@1217
<en>Why did this thing have to happen? I want to wake up from this horrible nightmare.
<es>

@1222
<en>I stepped outside to see everyone off.
<es>

@1225
<en>{Pierre}\n"We're fine here."
<es>

@1230
<en>{Appo}\n"Go back and keep making out with her."
<es>

@1231
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Planned to before you mentioned it."
<es>

@1232
<en>I was glad to have a chance to talk to my friends as I'd talked to virtually no one except Mizuki lately.
<es>

@1237
<en>{Rin}\n"I'm glad to see she's doing well. I'm a bit relieved."
<es>

@1238
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's a very strong girl."
<es>

@1239
<en>She definitely is. She never showed a hint of sadness in front of the others. Not even me.
<es>

@1240
<en>Because of that, in fact, I was even more worried about her.
<es>

@1245
<en>{Haruka}\n"What about you, Kazushi-kun? You've been with her every day, right? Are you getting enough sleep?"
<es>

@1246
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm fine. All I can do is to stay with her."
<es>

@1250
<en>{Ran}\n"Let me know if you need us for anything. I'll give you a discount."
<es>

@1251
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Still charging, huh?"
<es>

@1252
<en>For some reason, Ran's unchanging, wacky personality eased my mind.
<es>

@1253
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll let you know, if need be."
<es>

@1256
<en>{Ran}\n"You can count on us."
<es>

@1261
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi, I've been meaning to give you this."
<es>

@1262
<en>Daigo gave me a little paper bag.
<es>

@1263
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is this?"
<es>

@1264
<en>Inside it was the little pendant I bought for Mizuki.
<es>

@1265
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is..."
<es>

@1272
<en>{Pierre}\n"Mizuki-chan dropped it right before she jumped in the ocean to save you."
<es>

@1273
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see..."
<es>

@1274
<en>{Appo}\n"Give it back to her."
<es>

@1275
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks, guys."
<es>

@1281
<en>{Haruka}\n"Well, we'll be going now. You should head back to her too."
<es>

@1282
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, thanks guys."
<es>

@1284
<en>I went back to Mizuki's room after I saw them off.
<es>

@1290
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1291
<en>Mizuki was looking out the window when I returned. She looked different from how she was just a few moments ago, as a vacant, absent look took over her face.
<es>

@1292
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@1293
<en>I called her name in concern.
<es>

@1295
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, you're already back."
<es>

@1296
<en>She gave me her usual smile. Now I know she looks that sad when she's alone. I have to stay with her as long as I can.
<es>

@1297
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I talked a lot today. It feels like it's been ages since I've seen everybody, even though it's only been a few days."
<es>

@1298
<en>It's natural for her to think that way. Too many things happened in just a short period of time.
<es>

@1299
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Aren't you tired, Mizuki?"
<es>

@1300
<en>{Mizuki}\n"A little bit. Just lying in bed all the time is rather exhausting."
<es>

@1301
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't wait for us to go outside together."
<es>

@1302
<en>We were getting her a wheelchair soon, which would make it easy for us to leave the room.
<es>

@1303
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Honestly, I don't feel like being in a wheelchair."
<es>

@1304
<en>This is the first time I've ever heard such a depressed tone of voice from her.
<es>

@1305
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We can go outside, though..."
<es>

@1306
<en>{Mizuki}\n"People will worry about me if I'm in a wheelchair. I don't want people to keep worrying about me."
<es>

@1307
<en>Everybody knew that Mizuki was an ordinary, active girl just a few days ago.
<es>

@1308
<en>Anyone who knew Mizuki and saw her like that would share her forlorn feelings.
<es>

@1309
<en>Perhaps I would feel the same way if people gave me too much concern and sympathy.
<es>

@1310
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't have to think that way. If that's your reason, they're you're being too concerned about not making them show their concern."
<es>

@1311
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, you're right. It's just so hard..."
<es>

@1312
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, just relax. Don't frazzle your head - I'm here for you."
<es>

@1313
<en>Mizuki gave me a feeble smile.
<es>

@1314
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You don't have to push yourself, Kazushi. You don't have to be bound by me."
<es>

@1315
<en>She sounded gloomy again.
<es>

@1316
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about? I..."
<es>

@1318
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You don't have to stay by my side forever. It's a bother, isn't it?"
<es>

@1319
<en>What's making her feel that way? Is it because she talked with our friends today? Mizuki's never sounded this negative once since her injury.
<es>

@1320
<en>But her behavior's only natural. Now is the time I need to be strong for her.
<es>

@1321
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A bother? Not at all. I want to be with you, Mizuki."
<es>

@1322
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You don't have to force yourself."
<es>

@1323
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not. It's only natural that a man wants to be with the woman he loves, right? Besides, you're my first...you know?"
<es>

@1324
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1325
<en>Both of us were beet red.
<es>

@1326
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's really embarrassing, but thank you. I'm so happy, even if it's not true."
<es>

@1327
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It is true."
<es>

@1328
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But if I become too heavy a burden for you, just tell me. I won't tie you down to me. Besides, you could easily run away from me if you wanted."
<es>

@1329
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Because I can't run after you anymore."
<es>

@1330
<en>Mizuki smiled as she said such a sad thing. The sorrow left my heart feeling empty.
<es>

@1331
<en>{Mizuki}\n"If I was fine, then I'd chase you to ends of the earth if you tried to run, but now that's impossible for me. Ahaha..."
<es>

@1332
<en>Mizuki looked discouraged, which must be attributed to everybody dropping by earlier.
<es>

@1333
<en>She may have compared herself in bed all day to her friends, but that was only natural.
<es>

@1334
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah."
<es>

@1335
<en>I took the necklace out of my pocket and put it around her neck.
<es>

@1336
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah! You found it!?"
<es>

@1337
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You knew you'd lost it, huh?"
<es>

@1338
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Of course. I was touching it every day. But I couldn't tell you that I'd lost it. It was my lucky charm."
<es>

@1339
<en>She sounded like she wanted to say the accident happened because she'd lost her pendant. That wasn't true. I wouldn't want it to be.
<es>

@1340
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then don't lose it again."
<es>

@1341
<en>If it really was a lucky charm, then I wanted it to always protect her.
<es>

@1342
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes. Thank you."
<es>

@1343
<en>I know it's going to take some time for Mizuki to feel better, but I'll be right by her side helping her the whole way through.
<es>

@1348
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right! Take it down!"
<es>

@1351
<en>{Pierre}\n"I'm okay here."
<es>

@1356
<en>{Appo}\n"Easy, easy."
<es>

@1361
<en>{Daigo}\n"There we go!"
<es>

@1364
<en>Mizuki's brand-new wheelchair finally arrived today, and we took her down to the beach in it today. For a little while, this wheelchair was going to replace Mizuki's legs.
<es>

@1365
<en>...or for a long time.
<es>

@1366
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hnnngh. Hnnnngh. Hmm, I don't think it's possible on sand."
<es>

@1367
<en>{Pierre}\n"If only it was 4WD. Don't they have one like that?"
<es>

@1368
<en>{Ran}\n"I wouldn't think so. Do you know what 4WD stands for?"
<es>

@1369
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah, four-wheel-drive, right?"
<es>

@1370
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm. The smell of the ocean... It's been a while."
<es>

@1371
<en>It didn't seem like Mizuki was too traumatized by her coastal accident. She still enjoyed being by the sea and relaxing.
<es>

@1372
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How does it feel to be outside again?"
<es>

@1373
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I feel really good. It feels like my brain cells are finally starting to work, thanks to the wind and the smell of the sea."
<es>

@1374
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah?"
<es>

@1375
<en>We might as well come outside more often, then. It's good for her health too.
<es>

@1376
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREE!*
<es>

@1377
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah!"
<es>

@1378
<en>Mizuki immediately noticed the two dolphins looking out at us from the shallow water.
<es>

@1379
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREE!*
<es>

@1380
<en>{Mizuki}\n"They came here again! Even after the accident! Hey, Kazushi!"
<es>

@1381
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, hold on, Mizuki."
<es>

@1382
<en>I took hold of her wheelchair and pushed it to where the waves lapped against the beach, but I still couldn't take her far enough to reach them.
<es>

@1383
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREE!*
<es>

@1384
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm sorry I can't get there, but thank you for coming to see us. You guys look fine."
<es>

@1385
<en>{Dolphin}\n *SKREE!*
<es>

@1386
<en>The dolphins cried as if they were trying to comfort Mizuki. She must have been quite irritated at not being able to jump in the water with them.
<es>

@1387
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry. I wish I could swim with you guys again."
<es>

@1388
<en>But...no further words came out of her mouth.
<es>

@1389
<en>To Mizuki, being a few meters apart from them was like approaching an infinite distance. With a sorrowful look, Mizuki stared at the dolphins.
<es>

@1390
<en>Today was the last day of the summer holiday and our break was then over.
<es>

@1397
<en>{Mei}\n"Good morning, everyone. Long time, no see...or maybe not."
<es>

@1398
<en>Even after summer break ended, it felt like nothing really changed at school, given that we all lived in the same buildings.
<es>

@1399
<en>Well, not exactly. Something had changed.
<es>

@1400
<en>{Mei}\n"You may have noticed that Hinata-san isn't here with us today. As you all know, she got into a horrible accident during the summer."
<es>

@1403
<en>Mizuki wasn't in our classroom. There was an empty chair right next to me.
<es>

@1404
<en>{Rin}\n"When will Mizuki-chan return to school?"
<es>

@1405
<en>{Mei}\n"That may take some time. It might be quite difficult for her to adjust a new lifestyle, so it'd be great if you could help her out."
<es>

@1406
<en>{Rin}\n"Yes, of course."
<es>

@1407
<en>{Sakura}\n"Will you guys go to see her today?"
<es>

@1408
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh...today may not be a good time..."
<es>

@1412
<en>Mizuki had been feeling blue again ever since she saw the dolphins, so it may be better to give her some time for herself.
<es>

@1417
<en>{Pierre}\n"She must be tired from going outside yesterday."
<es>

@1418
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, it's better that we just let her get some rest today."
<es>

@1422
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Okay, why don't we just take a rain check today and wait until he tells us how she's doing?"
<es>

@1427
<en>{Ran}\n"Good idea. OK, Kazushi-kun?"
<es>

@1428
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay."
<es>

@1434
<en>I could see the door to her room was slightly open.
<es>

@1435
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ugh... You..."
<es>

@1436
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@1437
<en>I could hear a faint voice from inside, so I stopped my hand, which was about to open the door and peered in.
<es>

@1441
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ugh... This..."
<es>

@1442
<en>Mizuki was trying to stand up on her bed. However, she only had her upper body strength and nothing from her legs.
<es>

@1443
<en>It looked like her legs were no longer part of her.
<es>

@1444
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't get it. Why won't they move? What are these legs?!"
<es>

@1446
<en>She smacked her own legs around with her hands to try and jolt them to life, but it doesn't even seem to hurt her at all.
<es>

@1448
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You! You! What?! Can't you feel even a little pain, or anything?!"
<es>

@1450
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ggh...uugh... If I can just stand once, then..."
<es>

@1452
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Come on! Move! What's wrong with you?! You're attached properly! Why... You! You!"
<es>

@1454
<en>She violently beat her legs, but they didn't feel a thing. That made her frustrated, so she beat them again.
<es>

@1456
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are these legs?! These legs?! These!!"
<es>

@1458
<en>Normally it would be impossible to beat one's own body that hard. No matter what you tried, you'd wind up holding back, but Mizuki's legs were red from her beating.
<es>

@1459
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki...!"
<es>

@1460
<en>I couldn't let her do that any longer. I pounced into the room at the moment she lost her balance.
<es>

@1464
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah!!"
<es>

@1465
<en>Mizuki fell from the bed and curled up on the floor.
<es>

@1466
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki!!"
<es>

@1467
<en>I lifted her up. It looked like her elbow and shoulder were bruised.
<es>

@1470
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, huh? ...Ahaha, it didn't work."
<es>

@1471
<en>Mizuki gave me her usual smile with teary eyes. My chest sank.
<es>

@1472
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did you hurt yourself?"
<es>

@1475
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah. I hurt my shoulder and my elbow. They're throbbing a bit."
<es>

@1476
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let me see them."
<es>

@1477
<en>Her elbow was a little sore, but I couldn't see anything on her shoulder.
<es>

@1478
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's have the doctor see them."
<es>

@1479
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I just bumped it a little. I'm fine. I can tell by how bad the pain is - that's how our bodies work."
<es>

@1480
<en>Then Mizuki looked down at her legs.
<es>

@1483
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But these legs don't feel anything... So I have no idea. I don't even know how bad my legs got hurt when I just fell."
<es>

@1486
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahaha, I don't even know if I hurt them. They just won't move at all. It's like you said, Kazushi, I really have become a mermaid."
<es>

@1487
<en>Mizuki lay on her side as I held her in my arms. Her legs flopped around just like the lower half of a mermaid.
<es>

@1488
<en>But they had lost their beauty. There wasn't a trace of the beauty I saw in her legs when we first met left.
<es>

@1489
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry. Can you get me up to bed?"
<es>

@1491
<en>Mizuki seems to have calmed down now.
<es>

@1492
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@1493
<en>As Mizuki reached her hand out to the bed, I continued holding her tight.
<es>

@1496
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah, Kazushi..."
<es>

@1497
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll find a way to do something. I will make sure you can swim again."
<es>

@1498
<en>Until now, I'd intentionally avoided saying these words to her because I knew I couldn't live up to them.
<es>

@1499
<en>But once I said it, I knew I had to do it no matter what.
<es>

@1500
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will make your legs move."
<es>

@1503
<en>{Mizuki}\n"..................Okay."
<es>

@1505
<en>Mizuki's tears rushed out as if the dam had broken. I held her tightly in my arms, telling myself I would make it happen.
<es>

@1512
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I set fire to the burner, and..."
<es>

@1513
<en>Looking at my notes as a guide, I made preparations according to the procedure.
<es>

@1514
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Next is uhh... Argh, I should have paid more attention."
<es>

@1515
<en>It was too late for regrets now. The only thing that would let me have a chance at curing Mizuki's legs was alchemy.
<es>

@1516
<en>However, even Miya-san couldn't cure her. What could I, who has only dabbled in alchemy, possibly do? The thought was dismal.
<es>

@1517
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is still better than doing nothing."
<es>

@1518
<en>Just sitting there wouldn't make a difference - it would just lead to time passing by.
<es>

@1519
<en>If I take some action, however, I may be able to make a difference. Something different - maybe good, maybe bad.
<es>

@1520
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Either way, nothing could be worse than it is now."
<es>

@1521
<en>I have to follow the path I believe in. Mizuki's legs will never be cured if I stay still.
<es>

@1523
<en>Knock, knock...
<es>

@1524
<en>The knocks echoed across the quiet room.
<es>

@1525
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who is it?"
<es>

@1526
<en>Who could it be at this hour? Being a bit surprised, I responded with caution.
<es>

@1527
<en>{Mei}\n"It's me. Ibuki."
<es>

@1528
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, sensei. Please, come in."
<es>

@1529
<en>I sighed with relief. I had to explain my entire plan to her before she'd give me permission to use this lab.
<es>

@1533
<en>{Mei}\n"You're actually doing it, aren't you?"
<es>

@1534
<en>Mei-sensei said that upon entry with a surprised look. I guess she hadn't realized my devotion.
<es>

@1535
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is the least I can do for her."
<es>

@1537
<en>I asked her to take a seat nearby. Sitting in the chair, she looked over the poor set of lab equipment I'd laid out.
<es>

@1538
<en>She was speechless as she looked at them. I guess I flunked...
<es>

@1541
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't think that's true. I'm sure Hinata-san is very afraid right now, so being by her and supporting her is one thing."
<es>

@1542
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I do that during the afternoon, just as I have been. I have school too. That's why I can only work on this at night."
<es>

@1545
<en>{Mei}\n"What? Haruma-kun, are you planning to coop yourself up in here every night?"
<es>

@1546
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes...?"
<es>

@1547
<en>{Mei}\n"When are you going to sleep then?"
<es>

@1548
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I haven't really thought about that, but I think I can handle it."
<es>

@1551
<en>Mei-sensei sighed deeply and looked disappointed.
<es>

@1552
<en>{Mei}\n"I now regret letting you use this room. I gave in to your strong request because you seemed desperate to help Hinata-san."
<es>

@1553
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I really appreciate your help, sensei. It's gonna take some time, but I know I can do this..."
<es>

@1556
<en>{Mei}\n"You're wasting too much time."
<es>

@1559
<en>Suddenly, Mei-sensei stood up and started taking away my lab equipment.
<es>

@1560
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey?! What are you doing?!"
<es>

@1563
<en>{Mei}\n"All of this is useless!"
<es>

@1564
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Useless...? But I have to do something, useless or not!"
<es>

@1565
<en>{Mei}\n"You will destroy your health like this. I can't let you keep doing it."
<es>

@1566
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No..."
<es>

@1567
<en>{Mei}\n"If you're going to do it, then do so in way that might actually work."
<es>

@1568
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1569
<en>Before I knew it, Mei-sensei had rearranged all my lab equipment.
<es>

@1570
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh, sensei, is this...?"
<es>

@1573
<en>{Mei}\n"The way you were trying to do it had absolutely no chance of success. It's foolish to waste your life on that."
<es>

@1574
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, do you mean...?"
<es>

@1575
<en>Mei-sensei nodded.
<es>

@1578
<en>{Mei}\n"I'll agree to help you."
<es>

@1579
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You? Help me?"
<es>

@1582
<en>{Mei}\n"I will be rough with you, so be ready."
<es>

@1583
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ye-yes! Thank you!"
<es>

@1584
<en>I have no idea how I can do this, but I'm going to give it a try!
<es>

@1590
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey! How are you!!"
<es>

@1591
<en>Our morning classes ended at noon. I rushed over to the clinic to see Mizuki.
<es>

@1596
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahh..."
<es>

@1597
<en>Mizuki was awake in bed. She tried to get up when she saw me, but when she remembered she couldn't, she uncomfortably gave me a smile.
<es>

@1598
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You came again today?"
<es>

@1599
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm? Of course? Why do you say that?"
<es>

@1600
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Because yesterday..."
<es>

@1601
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yesterday? ...Oh."
<es>

@1602
<en>I'm dense. Mizuki cried her heart out to me yesterday. I thought she must have been worried about it.
<es>

@1603
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Am I too much for you?"
<es>

@1604
<en>She asked in a weak voice. She must have really been worried about it.
<es>

@1605
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I've told you, you're not."
<es>

@1606
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's not true. We just started seeing each other, and this happens... you must be fed up with it too, Kazushi."
<es>

@1607
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I told you, I'm not."
<es>

@1608
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You can tell me the truth. I don't want to be a burden on you. Don't make me be such a wretched woman."
<es>

@1609
<en>Her words were humble, but her tone was aggressive. She looks really upset today.
<es>

@1610
<en>She may not be able to control the emotions that she's been repressing for a while. I'm sure the other day was the trigger.
<es>

@1611
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm really okay by myself. I can go anywhere I want to in the wheelchair."
<es>

@1612
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But you can't go to the beach by yourself."
<es>

@1613
<en>During low tide, the beach was at the bottom of a long set of stairs.
<es>

@1614
<en>Besides, her wheelchair couldn't go across sand and rocks well, even with someone pushing her from behind.
<es>

@1616
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's fine. I don't want to see the ocean anymore."
<es>

@1617
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1618
<en>I couldn't believe those words came out of Mizuki's mouth. She didn't want to go and see the ocean?
<es>

@1619
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about? The ocean? Hello?"
<es>

@1620
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't care. I can't swim any more anyway. Looking at the sea only makes me depressed."
<es>

@1621
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Depressed? You were happy the other day."
<es>

@1622
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I realized when we got back that there's no place for me there anymore."
<es>

@1623
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Besides, I became crippled because of the sea. I never want to see it again!"
<es>

@1624
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But..."
<es>

@1625
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't want to hear any more 'buts'! Don't you understand how I feel? Do you ever?"
<es>

@1626
<en>She shouted in an angry voice. Her dream isn't in the ocean anymore?
<es>

@1627
<en>I mean, it is where that accident happened. I could understand not wanting to go or see it ever again.
<es>

@1628
<en>But that's if she were a normal person.
<es>

@1629
<en>Mizuki has always loved the sea. She loved being in the water more than on the ground. The girl who really was like a mermaid doesn't want to see the sea anymore?
<es>

@1630
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're lying."
<es>

@1631
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How am I lying?"
<es>

@1632
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's a lie that you don't want to see the ocean anymore. There's no way you would think that."
<es>

@1633
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How is it a lie?! What do you know about how I feel?!"
<es>

@1634
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. Because I know you."
<es>

@1635
<en>Mizuki gave me a fierce, sharp look.
<es>

@1637
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, you don't know how I truly feel! Then, tell me how I feel now! How do I feel about not be able to move my own legs!!"
<es>

@1638
<en>Mizuki's face was red with her anger.
<es>

@1639
<en>How does she feel about not moving her legs? Honestly, I don't know. I can't say that I do.
<es>

@1640
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@1641
<en>{Mizuki}\n"See? You can't say anything! So don't ever say you know how I'm feeling!"
<es>

@1642
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry. But, Mizuki..."
<es>

@1644
<en>Knock, knock...
<es>

@1645
<en>Right then, a light knock broke the tense air.
<es>

@1648
<en>{Ran}\n"Yoohoo! We're here to see you!"
<es>

@1649
<en>It was Ran. And Haruka was there too.
<es>

@1650
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hmm? Is everything okay?"
<es>

@1651
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahh..."
<es>

@1652
<en>Mizuki fell silent. I sensed a few others behind them. They were all here to see Mizuki.
<es>

@1653
<en>{Appo}\n"What? What? Hey, are we bothering you two, by any chance?"
<es>

@1654
<en>{Pierre}\n"Was Kazushi doing something naughty again, Mizuki? He's not a very delicate guy, you know."
<es>

@1655
<en>{Daigo}\n"Ah, maybe we should come back at some other time?"
<es>

@1656
<en>Nobody was sure of what was going on...
<es>

@1657
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1658
<en>Mizuki turned around and looked down. We all fell into an awkward silence. They came at the worst possible time.
<es>

@1659
<en>It may be better for them to just leave today.
<es>

@1660
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Guys, look..."
<es>

@1661
<en>I lowered my voice at the door so that Mizuki wouldn't hear.
<es>

@1662
<en>{Pierre}\n"Bad time, huh?"
<es>

@1663
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah...not now..."
<es>

@1664
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You should go too, Kazushi."
<es>

@1665
<en>Mizuki shouted at my back. Everyone turned their eyes over to her.
<es>

@1666
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry, guys. I know you're all worried about me. But please don't. I'd rather you didn't."
<es>

@1667
<en>Everyone looked puzzled by Mizuki's harsh words.
<es>

@1668
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sorry we barged in on you like this, Mizuki."
<es>

@1669
<en>{Daigo}\n"She's right. We'll come back some other time."
<es>

@1670
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You don't have to! Please leave me alone."
<es>

@1671
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Mizuki..."
<es>

@1672
<en>No longer able to ignore her, I cut in. It hurt me to see Mizuki so uncontrollably upset.
<es>

@1673
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What?"
<es>

@1674
<en>With teary eyes, Mizuki threw me a fierce look. I was too shocked to say anything else.
<es>

@1675
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't ask you guys to leave me alone? You guys all have it nice! You can go wherever you want, whenever you want!"
<es>

@1676
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But I can't even move from here. Even if I want to be alone, I can't go anywhere. All I can do is tell you not to come!"
<es>

@1677
<en>Mizuki's anger escalated as the tears began dropping down her face.
<es>

@1678
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know, Mizuki. We all know that."
<es>

@1679
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Don't just say you know so lightly! You're on their side anyways! You're just like them!"
<es>

@1680
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please, don't say it like that. I'm..."
<es>

@1681
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's enough!"
<es>

@1682
<en>Mizuki yelled at us with a strong sense of rejection. It was like watching her spirit withering away.
<es>

@1683
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's enough..."
<es>

@1684
<en>And Mizuki repeated herself under her breath. She was deflating like a balloon.
<es>

<en>{Mizuki}\n"Please leave me alone... You, too, Kazushi. Please go. I want to be alone."
<es>

@1686
<en>I could hear the sobs in her voice. Mizuki finally began to cry.
<es>

@1687
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@1688
<en>No one knew how to approach her. And even if any of us did know, all we would have done was hurt her instead.
<es>

@1689
<en>All we could do was to watch her cry.
<es>

@1696
<en>{Pierre}\n"Sorry, man."
<es>

@1697
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Me too, dude."
<es>

@1698
<en>I also left the room as Mizuki insisted.
<es>

@1703
<en>{Ran}\n"You don't have to worry about us. But what are you going to do now, Kazushi?"
<es>

@1710
<en>{Haruka}\n"Maybe we should just leave her alone like she asked?"
<es>

@1711
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. I won't leave her alone."
<es>

@1712
<en>Haruka may be right, but I just couldn't leave Mizuki by herself. It didn't matter how she felt - I wanted to stay there right by her side.
<es>

@1713
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She doesn't have the slightest idea of how much I need her."
<es>

@1714
<en>It wasn't just sympathy. The only reason I wanted to stay with her is because I wanted her to be with me.
<es>

@1717
<en>{Ran}\n"I guess it goes to show how stubborn she can get."
<es>

@1718
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not just Mizuki. I can be pretty stubborn as well."
<es>

@1721
<en>{Haruka}\n"You too?"
<es>

@1722
<en>Of course. I wasn't just going to back off.
<es>

@1725
<en>{Ran}\n"You look like you're about to do something."
<es>

@1729
<en>{Appo}\n"Why not? Just let him do whatever he wants."
<es>

@1730
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't just stop like this."
<es>

@1731
<en>I won't leave her alone. I won't.
<es>

@1736
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It should be around here."
<es>

@1737
<en>I set up camp on the roadside near the clinic where I could see the window to Mizuki's room. Now I'm still by her side.
<es>

@1738
<en>Mizuki told me not to visit, so I won't. But I'm too stubborn to follow her instructions to the letter. In this way, I'm showing my intention of always being with her.
<es>

@1739
<en>She may get mad if I go in her room, but she can't say anything about me being on the roadside.
<es>

@1740
<en>I got permission from the doctors at the clinic, as well as from Mei-sensei and Yagami-sensei because I wouldn't be coming to class for a while.
<es>

@1741
<en>All the arrangements had been made.
<es>

@1742
<en>In this way, I could be close to Mizuki. She'd be within reach and I could run over there any time if need be.
<es>

@1743
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm turning into a stalker."
<es>

@1744
<en>I've got to show her how determined I am. I can't just back off and say goodbye. I will stay here all day, every day.
<es>

@1747
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, is it that time already?"
<es>

@1748
<en>I saw the light in her room turn off. It was time for lights out.
<es>

@1749
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did she go to sleep?"
<es>

@1750
<en>Was she able to go to sleep quickly? Was she having nightmares?
<es>

@1751
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess I can't chase her into her dreams."
<es>

@1752
<en>Besides, there's other things I have to do. Things I wanted to do while Mizuki slept.
<es>

@1758
<en>*CRASH*
<es>

@1759
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wah?!"
<es>

@1760
<en>The flask shattered into pieces. Today's experiment...failed.
<es>

@1763
<en>{Mei}\n"Your failures are always so flashy. At least it's easy to tell."
<es>

@1764
<en>Mei-sensei sneered through her comment. She said that usually nothing happens at all when an experiment fails, but whenever I do, a flask breaks or it catches fire.
<es>

@1765
<en>It was easier to tell when something visible like that happened, but it was a bit scary too.
<es>

@1768
<en>{Mei}\n"Are you okay? You didn't get hurt?"
<es>

@1769
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm fine. But why do I always blow up things?"
<es>

@1770
<en>{Mei}\n"You have the sense to pick out two substances and make them react. Maybe it's a natural-born talent? But you don't know how to control the process yet."
<es>

@1771
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do I really have that kind of sense?"
<es>

@1772
<en>It was rather hard to believe.
<es>

@1775
<en>{Mei}\n"The only way to get a grasp on the right feeling is repetition. So in that sense, even your mistakes have value, so keep failing."
<es>

@1776
<en>Mei-sensei's words were so encouraging.
<es>

@1777
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If we need failures, then leave it to me!"
<es>

@1780
<en>{Mei}\n"Except you can't approach it with the intention of failing."
<es>

@1781
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, you're right. Ahaha..."
<es>

@1784
<en>{Mei}\n"On that note, I think that's enough for one night. Let's call it a day."
<es>

@1785
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're right. Thank you very much."
<es>

@1786
<en>I have to admit, I felt bad for Mei-sensei staying so late with me.
<es>

@1787
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you getting enough sleep, sensei? Is your skin going to be alright?"
<es>

@1790
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh? Does it look bad to you?"
<es>

@1791
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, not at all."
<es>

@1792
<en>Mei-sensei was as brilliantly beautiful as always.
<es>

@1795
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, I have MEIkeup on now, so it probably looks better than it is. After all, it's MEIkeup."
<es>

@1796
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah, ahaha... you seem fine."
<es>

@1799
<en>{Mei}\n"What about you, Haruma-kun? Your eyes are a little red. You need to at least sleep until morning."
<es>

@1800
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am, but no one's ever died from lack of sleep. I'll fall asleep naturally when I can't endure anymore, right?"
<es>

@1801
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, but... Don't push yourself too hard, okay?"
<es>

@1802
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I understand. Thank you."
<es>

@1804
<en>I'm not pushing myself too hard. I'm doing what my heart tells me to do.
<es>

@1809
<en>I ran back to the clinic after cleaning up at the lab.
<es>

@1810
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Brr... It's so cold."
<es>

@1811
<en>I went to camping in Karuizawa one summer, and it was similar to that. In short, it can get pretty cold in the morning, even in summer.
<es>

@1812
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, the sun's coming up."
<es>

@1813
<en>Instantly, the sun began lighting up the entire island. Morning was here.
<es>

@1814
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, the sunshine feels so warm. How great the sun is!"
<es>

@1815
<en>I also hoped that Mizuki would soon bathe herself in the bright sunlight. She had to get out of that tiny, disinfectant-scented room.
<es>

@1816
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess Mizuki won't be up for a while."
<es>

@1817
<en>I could see the curtain drawn in her window. She must still be in bed.
<es>

@1818
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I'd better go get some breakfast while she's still asleep."
<es>

@1820
<en>{Nurse}\n"Rise and shine, Mizuki-chan!"
<es>

@1821
<en>The nurse opened the curtains and the bright sunlight beamed in through the window.
<es>

@1822
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm..."
<es>

@1824
<en>Mizuki opened her eyes slowly. She wasn't very awake. She'd been sleeping poorly every night, so it didn't feel like she'd slept at all.
<es>

@1825
<en>Today she didn't even know if she had slept or not. All that stuff happened just yesterday for one thing.
<es>

@1826
<en>{Nurse}\n"You still look sleepy. I don't mind, but let me take your temperature at least."
<es>

@1827
<en>The nurse pressed the thermometer towards her, and Mizuki helplessly put it under her arm and sat still.
<es>

@1828
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1829
<en>She was only staying still because she didn't have the will to move. Nothing mattered to her anymore. She was alone now.
<es>

@1830
<en>After taking it out on everyone like that, she'd already given them cause to hate her. Even Kazushi...
<es>

@1831
<en>{Mizuki}\n"............*sniff*"
<es>

@1832
<en>Mizuki just barely held back her sobs.
<es>

@1833
<en>She didn't want to cry anymore. Doing so would only make her miserable.
<es>

@1834
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Nothing matters anymore."
<es>

@1835
<en>Just then, Mizuki looked out the window.
<es>

@1836
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@1837
<en>Mizuki's mouth dropped open in sheer astonishment.
<es>

@1842
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, heeeeey! You're awake?!"
<es>

@1843
<en>It was Kazushi! He was right there on the side of the road grilling some fish! He was blowing away the black smoke with a fan.
<es>

@1844
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What's he doing there?"
<es>

@1845
<en>Mizuki's thoughts froze up as she looked upon that sight.
<es>

@1846
<en>No anger, no laughter. No feelings. Her mind was blank.
<es>

@1847
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I just caught this fish for breakfast. You want to try some?"
<es>

@1848
<en>{Mizuki}\n"..................what is he talking about?"
<es>

@1849
<en>In no time, some emotion boiled up inside of Mizuki's blank mind. It was her anger.
<es>

@1850
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wooooow! This is great! Mizuki, this is delicious!!"
<es>

@1851
<en>Mizuki flew into a rage as she watched Kazushi chomping down on freshly grilled fish.
<es>

@1852
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm suffering through all this on my own. What the hell is he smiling at?"
<es>

@1853
<en>Mizuki looked away from Kazushi and sank into bed, throwing the sheets over her head.
<es>

@1854
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, you idiot! Stupid Kazushi!"
<es>

@1855
<en>To her surprise, Mizuki still had the strength left to throw curses at him.
<es>

@1862
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1863
<en>Night fell early on the clinic and it was already time for her to go to bed. The nurse had already drawn the curtains, but Mizuki was looking past them.
<es>

@1864
<en>She was able to see him there the whole time before the curtains were drawn. She wondered if he was still out there.
<es>

@1865
<en>{Mizuki}\n"...you're an idiot. I'm going to sleep."
<es>

@1866
<en>Mizuki thought it would be a waste of time to even think about Kazushi. She tucked herself in.
<es>

@1867
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, you idiot... good night..."
<es>

@1868
<en>..................
<es>

@1869
<en>............
<es>

@1870
<en>Mizuki soon feel asleep.
<es>

@1871
<en>That night, Mizuki slept soundly for the first time since the accident.
<es>

@1874
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is she asleep now?"
<es>

@1875
<en>I had a feeling before. Even though the curtains were drawn and the lights out, she was still up until now.
<es>

@1876
<en>I heard the sounds of her rustling around, her sighs, her coughs, and I knew she was awake. But now they were gone.
<es>

@1877
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good night, Mizuki."
<es>

@1878
<en>I uttered it under my breath. There wasn't any response, of course.
<es>

@1879
<en>I just felt happy to know she's right there with me. I'm not here just for her sake in general, but so that she doesn't feel so lonely.
<es>

@1880
<en>It dawned on me, however, that maybe I was the one fighting off their loneliness.
<es>

@1881
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I guess that's because she told me not to visit her anymore..."
<es>

@1882
<en>I felt so lonely. That's why I started acting like a stubborn child and going about this roundabout method.
<es>

@1883
<en>{Kazushi}\n"God... I'm so childish... and so is Mizuki."
<es>

@1884
<en>I'm sure it's not easy for her to be honest. But if I can get her legs to move again, then I'm sure she'll be back to normal.
<es>

@1885
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I have to hang in there."
<es>

@1886
<en>After double checking that she was asleep, I headed to the lab.
<es>

@1891
<en>It was drizzling. The autumn came a bit closer every time it rains, and the rain made it extra chilly today.
<es>

@1893
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi! He's drenched!"
<es>

@1894
<en>Kazushi was standing under the clinic's eaves, but he still wasn't completely sheltered from the rain.
<es>

@1895
<en>He was pretty soaked, and yet he didn't seem to even care.
<es>

@1896
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't care if it's summer, he can still catch a cold."
<es>

@1897
<en>God, he's so stupid. Why doesn't he just come inside the clinic and stay in the waiting room or something?
<es>

@1898
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Is he trying to show off?"
<es>

@1899
<en>As she watched Kazushi getting wet in the rain, she grew more and more irritated. She couldn't take it anymore and opened the window.
<es>

@1901
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey!"
<es>

@1902
<en>She shouted at him.
<es>

@1905
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh! This is rare! You don't usually call out to me first."
<es>

@1906
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you doing there, all soaking wet? Are you trying to show me how pitiful you are?"
<es>

@1907
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Pitiful?"
<es>

@1908
<en>Kazushi looked perplexed by what she said. It seemed he has no idea what she meant.
<es>

@1909
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What the hell are you doing out there? It's raining."
<es>

@1910
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is the only spot I can see your room from."
<es>

@1911
<en>He answered like it was nothing special.
<es>

@1912
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Are you trying to show off or something?"
<es>

@1913
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Not really. Rain doesn't bother me at all. It's just water, remember?"
<es>

@1914
<en>Kazushi said that with honesty, which only made her worry.
<es>

@1915
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I know it's not so cold now, but your body will get cold if you stay out there when you're wet! Don't blame me when you catch a cold!"
<es>

@1916
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Are you worried about me, Mizuki?"
<es>

@1917
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? No. No way!"
<es>

@1921
<en>Slam!
<es>

@1922
<en>Mizuki slammed the window shut. Her face was warm. Was it because blood had rushed to her head, or...?
<es>

@1923
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But I kind of feel good after I yell."
<es>

@1924
<en>Before she knew it, she felt refreshed. She also wondered how many days it had been since she last spoke to Kazushi as she peeked out the window.
<es>

@1925
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Aaaaaahhhh......"
<es>

@1926
<en>Kazushi looked up at the sky with his mouth open, drinking in the rain.
<es>

@1927
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Stupid..."
<es>

@1928
<en>Mizuki tried to suppress her smile.
<es>

@1931
<en>It had become my daily routine to work at the lab as soon as the lights turned off in Mizuki's room.
<es>

@1936
<en>{Mei}\n"Let's try this one next."
<es>

@1937
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, ma'am."
<es>

@1938
<en>Mei-sensei was still helping me until late at night, though not all the way to morning. I was truly grateful for her help.
<es>

@1941
<en>{Mei}\n"We already know that the substances generated from these can revitalize nerves and cells. However, reviving nerves that have completely died..."
<es>

@1942
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is pretty difficult?"
<es>

@1943
<en>{Mei}\n"Miya-san tried almost everything we can do. There's not much we can do to try and top Miya-san either, so we'll just have to spend time trying things we haven't done before."
<es>

@1944
<en>{Mei}\n"This will require much time and patience."
<es>

@1945
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I understand."
<es>

@1946
<en>Even with sensei's help, the situation was rather grave. I was still thankful to have her with me, though.
<es>

@1949
<en>{Mei}\n"That's why you can't rush. You have to get your rest too, Haruma-kun."
<es>

@1950
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're right."
<es>

@1951
<en>I understood it in my head, but my heart pushed me to work hard and fast so that I could get her legs cured.
<es>

@1952
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, you'll just have to follow your own instinct. But in exchange, I will stop you from continuing if I see it taking too much of a toll on you. Okay? That's why I'm here."
<es>

@1953
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thank you."
<es>

@1955
<en>At that moment, the door opened.
<es>

@1961
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi!"
<es>

@1962
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Daigo?"
<es>

@1963
<en>Daigo burst through the door, and Pierre and Appo were there with him.
<es>

@1970
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh, there he is. He really is here."
<es>

@1973
<en>{Appo}\n"Huh? Mei-chan's here too? Why?!"
<es>

@1974
<en>The three guys just barged into the room. I was dumbfounded.
<es>

@1975
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why are you all here?"
<es>

@1976
<en>I didn't tell these guys about my work in the lab.
<es>

@1977
<en>I should have, but I didn't want them worrying about me.
<es>

@1978
<en>That's why I told them I was spending my nights at the clinic.
<es>

@1979
<en>{Daigo}\n"Hey, rumor has it there's a ghost in the lab."
<es>

@1980
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A ghost? Here? Are you sure?"
<es>

@1981
<en>That gave me the creeps. I felt like someone was watching me from the darkness.
<es>

@1982
<en>{Appo}\n"No, you're the ghost, Kazushi!"
<es>

@1983
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Me?"
<es>

@1984
<en>{Pierre}\n"There's been lights on in the lab every night, so..."
<es>

@1985
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, because I've been here working?"
<es>

@1991
<en>{Mei}\n"I didn't even know that such a rumor was going around..."
<es>

@1996
<en>{Daigo}\n"So we came here to check."
<es>

@1997
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see."
<es>

@2001
<en>{Appo}\n"Well, we figured it was you."
<es>

@2002
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How did you know I was here?"
<es>

@2003
<en>{Daigo}\n"We knew as soon as you tried to sneak around doing something. You can't hide anything from us, Kazushi."
<es>

@2004
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, you're right."
<es>

@2005
<en>It wouldn't be the first time I thought I was working hard on my own only to have someone helping me without my knowledge. I'm not alone.
<es>

@2006
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks, guys."
<es>

@2013
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, it's too early to thank us. Hold onto that thought until you get Mizuki's legs cured."
<es>

@2014
<en>{Daigo}\n"So, what should we do?"
<es>

@2015
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do? Are you all helping too? If you start now it'll take until morning?"
<es>

@2018
<en>{Pierre}\n"If it takes two until morning, then with five people we'll have it done before breakfast."
<es>

@2021
<en>{Daigo}\n"That doesn't sound much different."
<es>

@2022
<en>{Appo}\n"If we left you to do it on your own, who knows how long it'd take before Mizuki-chan's legs were healed. This ain't for you, it's for her."
<es>

@2027
<en>{Pierre}\n"Okay. Let's get to work!"
<es>

@2029
<en>The three of them began to start working.
<es>

@2030
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Guys..."
<es>

@2033
<en>{Mei}\n"Haruma-kun, you have good friends."
<es>

@2034
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I do."
<es>

@2039
<en>The next day...
<es>

@2045
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi-kun!"
<es>

@2050
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You've been treating us like strangers!"
<es>

@2051
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@2052
<en>A lot of the girls came by the lab.
<es>

@2057
<en>{Pierre}\n"Well, I wound up telling the girls our tale of camaraderie to demonstrate that we're great guys who are willing to sacrifice ourselves for a friend."
<es>

@2058
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So because you wanted some action..."
<es>

@2062
<en>{Ran}\n"For what it's worth, we're here to help too. And considering the situation, I'll let you pay me back when you make it big."
<es>

@2067
<en>{Rin}\n"Haruma-kun, don't listen to her, okay? We're not going to charge you."
<es>

@2071
<en>{Sakura}\n"No, Ran definitely wants to..."
<es>

@2072
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're all here to help out?"
<es>

@2077
<en>{Haruka}\n"Of course. Have some crackers."
<es>

@2082
<en>{Andou}\n"We also want Mizuki-chan to get well soon. So this isn't for you. We want to help Mizuki-chan."
<es>

@2083
<en>Mizuki doesn't have just me, but all these beautiful friends.
<es>

@2084
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks, guys."
<es>

@2088
<en>{Fuusen}\n"But even Miya-san failed to do it, right? How could we do it then?"
<es>

@2089
<en>Fuusen said that a bit discouragingly. Yes, what we're trying to do is incredibly difficult.
<es>

@2095
<en>{Haruka}\n"Miya-san's an excellent alchemist, even though he doesn't look like it. My grandma saw talent in him and brought him to the island. It seems like he's been a lot, so now he's retired, but..."
<es>

@2100
<en>{Pierre}\n"That Miya-san?"
<es>

@2105
<en>{Appo}\n"So even a top-rate alchemist threw in the towel. Can alchemy really accomplish this?"
<es>

@2109
<en>{Daigo}\n"But we can do it if we put our heads together, right?"
<es>

@2110
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah. Unity can make a difference when each individual cannot."
<es>

@2115
<en>{Haruka}\n"Unity...What do you think, Kazuko-chan?"
<es>

@2120
<en>{Fuusen}\n"I'm not sure. If we split up and run all the burners, we'd be able to experiment with all kinds of combinations, so that would be logical."
<es>

@2124
<en>{Ran}\n"But, sorry, I won't be much help."
<es>

@2128
<en>{Daigo}\n"Me neither. I'm not very confident..."
<es>

@2129
<en>Also, if we split up, it doesn't change the fact that everyone's working on their own, so there's not much point.
<es>

@2133
<en>{Pierre}\n"We may come up with something good if we all keep throwing ideas out."
<es>

@2140
<en>{Appo}\n"This isn't a matter of addition, right? I think that something impossible for one person may become possible if they do it with someone else."
<es>

@2141
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I agree."
<es>

@2142
<en>My guy friends have made a lot of things possible that I wouldn't have achieved solo, though a lot of what we've done has also failed in the end.
<es>

@2143
<en>But it's not uncommon for a different result to occur when we don't handle it alone.
<es>

@2149
<en>{Natsume}\n"There may be truth to that."
<es>

@2150
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm? Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@2151
<en>When did she get here?
<es>

@2152
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How long have you been sitting there?"
<es>

@2156
<en>{Pierre}\n"Right? You didn't notice her either?"
<es>

@2161
<en>{Appo}\n"She is small..."
<es>

@2165
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hissss!!!"
<es>

@2168
<en>{Appo}\n"She's threatening me?"
<es>

@2172
<en>{Ran}\n"She's so relaxing."
<es>

@2173
<en>But this is no time to relax.
<es>

@2176
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Natsume-chan, what did you mean by that?"
<es>

@2179
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yeah. You said, 'There may be some truth to that'."
<es>

@2184
<en>{Natsume}\n"Do you remember what Hisae did?"
<es>

@2185
<en>{Haruka}\n"My grandma?"
<es>

@2190
<en>{Fuusen}\n"She means that, right? That time we were asked to watch the fire?"
<es>

@2191
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah."
<es>

@2192
<en>That was when Natsume-chan showed up. She nodded in agreement.
<es>

@2196
<en>{Natsume}\n"Can you explain what happened then, Ao?"
<es>

@2197
<en>Ao? Who?
<es>

@2202
<en>{Haruka}\n".................."
<es>

@2203
<en>Oh, it's Haruka.
<es>

@2206
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, she's ignoring me."
<es>

@2207
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She doesn't know who you're referring to. Haruka, she wants to know what you think."
<es>

@2210
<en>{Haruka}\n"What? Me? Ao?... Oh, I get it... Ao, huh..."
<es>

@2211
<en>Haruka looked out into the distance at first and then refocused on us.
<es>

@2214
<en>{Haruka}\n"I did try to figure out... what my grandma was doing back then."
<es>

@2217
<en>{Natsume}\n"Then you know now?"
<es>

@2218
<en>Haruka nodded suggestively, but she was having trouble giving us her answer.
<es>

@2219
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it that the principal was trying to do? If it has any hints for curing Mizuki's legs, then please tell me."
<es>

@2222
<en>{Haruka}\n"Okay... it's not a direct hint, though. It just means there's meaning in all of us working together."
<es>

@2226
<en>{Ran}\n"Even me?"
<es>

@2230
<en>{Haruka}\n"You all understand that alchemy seeks to create the ideal substance by fusing a male element with a female element to eliminate all faults, right?"
<es>

@2232
<en>{Haruka}\n"A male element and a female element. Both of these are just properties, but they can also be replaced directly with men and women. Furthermore, every alchemic process is a project of our mental world."
<es>

@2234
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Our mental world?"
<es>

@2235
<en>{Haruka}\n"By uniting our mental worlds, our hearts, our feelings, and our desires on a higher dimension, it is possible an entirely new phenomena will occur."
<es>

@2240
<en>{Daigo}\n"So then if we all work together, it's possible something different may happen?"
<es>

@2241
<en>{Haruka}\n"Right?"
<es>

@2245
<en>{Natsume}\n".........Uh-huh."
<es>

@2246
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@2247
<en>I think this may have given me hope. No, I'll pull up as much hope as I need. No matter what, I'm going to cure Mizuki's legs.
<es>
