<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wow, it's still so slimy...and this smells..."
<es>

@11
<en>Mizuki scoops up my semen from her body and smells it. It's a little embarrassing for me to see her doing it.
<es>

@14
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, you have the tadpoles in here then? Wow, I drank this, didn't I? So the tadpoles are now swimming in my stomach?"
<es>

@17
<en>{Mizuki}\n"... ... ..."
<es>

@18
<en>She is visualizing it.
<es>

@21
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Whew, yuck..."
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You didn't have to force yourself to drink it."
<es>

@25
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You never know until you give it a try, you know? And it was not so bad."
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@27
<en>I don't think I would drink it for myself. I guess after all love conquers all, huh? She damn loves me.
<es>

@30
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you snickering at?"
<es>

@31
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, nothing..."
<es>

@32
<en>Today, again, we walked up one step toward the adulthood.
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's hot again today."
<es>

@38
<en>I guess I will go swimming with Mizuki. I'm a better swimmer now.
<es>

@41
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!"
<es>

@42
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Perfect timing!"
<es>

@43
<en>Mizuki runs up to me but she looks a bit panicky.
<es>

@44
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's going on?"
<es>

@45
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You can't believe this! Come with me now!"
<es>

@50
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is that?"
<es>

@51
<en>I see something moving in and out of the sea. Some sort of back fins? And they are quite big, too.
<es>

@52
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No shit..."
<es>

@55
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I know!"
<es>

@56
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sharks?"
<es>

@59
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Nooooo! Dolphins! They are dolphins!"
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow! Dolphins!!"
<es>

@63
<en>{Mizuki}\n"They finally came! Oh my god!!"
<es>

@64
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good! They came finally!!"
<es>

@65
<en>Mizuki said she'd never seen dolphins. But now this is really happening.
<es>

@66
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Amazing! I just told you about them not too long ago, Kazushi! I'd never seen them since I came here. But right after I told you, they just came!"
<es>

@67
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Did you bring them here?"
<es>

@68
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's just a coincidence, but I'm happy for you, Mizuki."
<es>

@71
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Thank you! Uh!!"
<es>

@73
<en>Splashes.
<es>

@75
<en>The dolphins bounce up in the water. There are two of them in the sea. As the sunlight and splashes cross, the rainbow arches over them.
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, this is just like a dolphins' show!"
<es>

@79
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So cute! Look, they look like a couple, don't they?"
<es>

@80
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No idea. But they surely look good together."
<es>

@81
<en>The two dolphins are swimming through together as if they were making out in the water.
<es>

@84
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I am gonna swim now."
<es>

@86
<en>Mizuki takes off all of her clothes.
<es>

@87
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, wait..."
<es>

@88
<en>I don't know why, but I look away from her. Although I have seen her in the nude before, but I guess because to the different circumstances.
<es>

@91
<en>Wait a minute, she is not naked! She has her swimsuit on. Oh, so it was not on a whim...
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She is gone..."
<es>

@95
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No...please don't go away!"
<es>

@96
<en>The dolphins are going away. At a distance, they are peering around, swimming around Mizuki.
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You should not have jumped in. You scared them."
<es>

@98
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Come on! Don't act like this is someone else's problem. Come here with me and help me get them over here."
<es>

@99
<en>Jumping in and out of water, Mizuki invites me in.
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, your tits are also jumping up and down."
<es>

@101
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wh-What are you looking at? Come on in, Kazushi!"
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think It's gonna make any difference."
<es>

@103
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What was all the swimming training for? It is the time to show what you got!"
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You may be right."
<es>

@105
<en>I was able to swim just today. Then such a great opportunity comes right before me! Lucky me! Sea-goddess blesses me or what!
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will be right there!"
<es>

@107
<en>I take off my clothes and am ready to jump into the sea.
<es>

@108
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No! You don't have to take all of your clothes!"
<es>

@109
<en>Gee, she is very demanding. It's rather a shame to put the underwear back on now. But I guess I have to...
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow. I've never been in the water with the underwear on."
<es>

@115
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The men's underwear and swimsuit look all the same. Anyway, come on, Join me to call them. Ryu, ryu, ryu, ryu...!"
<es>

@116
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ryu, ryu, ryu, ryu...!"
<es>

@117
<en>We keep calling them. But is this really the way to do it?
<es>

@118
<en>{Dolphin}\nOne dolphin squeaks.
<es>

@121
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It responded!"
<es>

@122
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow. Is that for real?"
<es>

@124
<en>{Dolphin}\nAnother dolphin squeaks.
<es>

@125
<en>Another dolphin cries too. Are they really responding? One of them is approaching us.
<es>

@126
<en>{Dolphin}\nOne dolphin squeaks.
<es>

@127
<en>The water is too shallow where we are now, so they can't get closer. We are still far apart.
<es>

@128
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki, go ahead."
<es>

@129
<en>I push Mizuki on the back.
<es>

@132
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Only me? You are not gonna come with me?"
<es>

@133
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think I'm ready that far, and I don't want to be in your way. You're gonna be fine."
<es>

@136
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Okay."
<es>

@138
<en>Mizuki slowly swims along in a little awkward way.
<es>

@139
<en>{Dolphin}\nThe dolphins squeak.
<es>

@140
<en>The dolphins cruise around as if they were welcoming Mizuki.
<es>

@141
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki! Yes, they are waiting for you."
<es>

@142
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes!"
<es>

@143
<en>Mizuki takes a deep breath and dives into the water. The dolphins also disappear into the sea.
<es>

@144
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki, good luck!!"
<es>

@145
<en>Neither Mizuki nor the dolphins come back up yet. No idea what is going on down in the water. One minute pass, two minutes passes...
<es>

@149
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi!"
<es>

@150
<en>Mizuki bobs back up with splashes.
<es>

@151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So?"
<es>

@154
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Come down with me!"
<es>

@155
<en>She takes my hand.
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Down? Wow!"
<es>

@159
<en>With incredible strength, Mizuki pulls me down into the water.
<es>

@163
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Woooo!!"
<es>

@164
<en>Incredible strength turns out be the dolphin!
<es>

@165
<en>{Mizuki}\n"They want to play with us!!"
<es>

@166
<en>With a sparkling smile, Mizuki grips the dolphin's back fins with one hand and my hand with the other.
<es>

@167
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is incredible! You've already become friends with them!"
<es>

@168
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So strange! It feels like I've finally met someone I love, who was far away for a long time!"
<es>

@169
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, someone you love...Wait, isn't that supposed to be me?"
<es>

@170
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Haha. Are you jealous?"
<es>

@171
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not really..."
<es>

@172
<en>I pretend to be pouting, looking at Mizuki's brilliant beams of smile.
<es>

@173
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi! Hold here!!"
<es>

@174
<en>Mizuki pulls my hand over to one of the dolphins' fins. I grip it.
<es>

@175
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hold on tight! Don't let go!"
<es>

@176
<en>Mizuki moves to the other dolphin.
<es>

@177
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wowwww!!"
<es>

@178
<en>The water splashes me on the face like millions of small stones hitting - - at amazing speed.
<es>

@179
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi! Take a deep breath!"
<es>

@180
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?!"
<es>

@181
<en>All of a sudden, I am pulled down.
<es>

@184
<en>Splash!!
<es>

@185
<en>Wooow!?
<es>

@186
<en>{Kazushi}\n(God! My eyes! My eyes hurt!)
<es>

@187
<en>But soon...
<es>

@188
<en>{Mizuki}\n(See?)
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Oh, my god!! Damn so beautiful!!)
<es>

@190
<en>Mizuki and I communicate by our expressions and gestures. I am not sure if I get my message across, but pretty sure she knows I am damn excited.
<es>

@191
<en>This is the first time for me to see the sea from inside. It is a totally different world from the ground. I now know why Mizuki gets so attracted by it.
<es>

@192
<en>This sea looks bit different from other seas in the south. The color of water is not emerald green.
<es>

@193
<en>It's blue - total blue. It looks like the universe rather than the sea.
<es>

@194
<en>Everywhere looks all blue, which numbs my sense of direction. All I know is where is bright is above.
<es>

@195
<en>It looks pretty deep down the bottom. The blue gets deeper as the world of the sea gets deeper.
<es>

@196
<en>The natural sense of fear comes over me as I stare at the deep empty space.
<es>

@197
<en>{Mizuki}\n"---!"
<es>

@198
<en>Mizuki holds my hand tight. I even feel her sense of bliss from her hand.
<es>

@199
<en>{Dolphin}\nThe dolphins cry.
<es>

@200
<en>The dolphins dance around us as we swim through with our hands together.
<es>

@201
<en>{Mizuki}\n"---!"
<es>

@202
<en>As Mizuki bobs her head with a smile, I answer with a nod.
<es>

@203
<en>{Dolphin}\nThe dolphins squeak.
<es>

@204
<en>It seems the dolphins smile back to us. This is absolutely a life-changing experience.
<es>

@209
<en>Mizuki is still excited on the way home.
<es>

@212
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The dolphins were so adorable! Look at my hands. I really touched them with my hands!"
<es>

@213
<en>She keeps on talking about the dolphins like a little kid.
<es>

@214
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Inside the see -- It was just amazingly beautiful."
<es>

@217
<en>{Mizuki}\n"This island is a very special place. I don't think there are many seas out there with this beauty."
<es>

@218
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? I was just blown away today."
<es>

@219
<en>Honestly, I feel very lucky I can swim now. I've never been interested in the sea until today.
<es>

@222
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Glad you said that. I contributed a bit then."
<es>

@223
<en>Now I feel that perhaps, I only knew about Mizuki partially, because I didn't know anything about greatness of the sea.
<es>

@224
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe I ought to get a license for scuba diving."
<es>

@225
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Haha. You are on a roll, Kazushi."
<es>

@226
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why don't you get a scuba diving license?"
<es>

@229
<en>{Mizuki}\n"If you want, I will do it too. I was gonna get it someday, but never really had an urge or a chance to do it."
<es>

@230
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I thought you liked scuba diving."
<es>

@231
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I do, but it's not really what I like. I love touching water. So I don't want to wear too many things on me."
<es>

@232
<en>{Mizuki}\n"In other words, I want to be truly myself, like a baby, so that I can face the water just as naturally as possible."
<es>

@233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see your point - - and your particularity."
<es>

@236
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, I'm so particular when it comes to that. Anyways, I really had a great time today. Today can be marked as the historic day for me."
<es>

@237
<en>Sounds a bit exaggerating at first. But to come to think of it, I have to agree that today has made such an impact for her.
<es>

@238
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I wonder if the dolphins come here again. I want to show them to our friends."
<es>

@239
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They will come back if they like here."
<es>

@242
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah. I hope they do."
<es>

@243
<en>Mizuki talks with her sparkling eyes as if she were missing her boyfriend far from her. I feel a bit jealous.
<es>

@244
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Good things have kept happening since you gave this to me, Kazushi."
<es>

@245
<en>Mizuki pulls the necklace out of her shirt. That is the pendant I bought for her at Mr.Miya's store.
<es>

@246
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, you're wearing that, huh?"
<es>

@249
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Of course. This is one of my most important things right now."
<es>

@250
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good to know."
<es>

@251
<en>I feel happy to hear that. Gee, I'm so sensitive that I now no longer feel jealous of the dolphins.
<es>

@252
<en>After all, we humans are sensitive animals.
<es>

@253
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Maybe, this stone made it possible for me to see the dolphins."
<es>

@254
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The stone?"
<es>

@257
<en>{Mizuki}\n"This stone is made of the special kind of stone, right? Plus, isn't it quite expensive?"
<es>

@258
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mr.Miya also said the stone is some kind of a lucky charm, or something."
<es>

@259
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, this stone may have the power to grant our wishes."
<es>

@260
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know."
<es>

@261
<en>I'm not sure if there is such a convenient stone in our world. But, if Mizuki wants to believe it, I won't argue. Let us let it be then.
<es>

@264
<en>{Mizuki}\n"If it's fine tomorrow, why don't we go there again with everyone together? I really want them to see the dolphins."
<es>

@265
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A good idea. I hope it will be fine tomorrow."
<es>

@268
<en>Unfortunately, it is a storm next day.
<es>

@273
<en>{Appo-}\n"We should cancel it today."
<es>

@274
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. It's pretty stormy with a lot of rain."
<es>

@275
<en>Mizuki must be disappointing. This storm ruins her whole plan.
<es>

@276
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, the sea is not gonna disappear. So we don't have to be so discouraged."
<es>

@279
<en>{Appo-}\n"Of course. The sea won't disappear. What are you talking about?"
<es>

@280
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shut up."
<es>

@281
<en>I don't know why, but I've got a very funny feeling about this.
<es>

@282
<en>However, I have no idea what it is.
<es>

@283
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will be out for a while."
<es>

@284
<en>Something tells me to go and check.
<es>

@285
<en>{Appo-}\n"Hey, Kazushi! Where are you going? It's a storm out there! It's too dangerous!"
<es>

@286
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will go see the water. Will be right back."
<es>

@287
<en>{Appo-}\n"The water? You mean the sea? Why? Can't you just check it from here?"
<es>

@288
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. See you later."
<es>

@293
<en>First, I go check the girls' dorm.
<es>

@296
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What a day! Too bad."
<es>

@297
<en>Mizuki is in her room at the dorm. I thought she might have gone to the sea alone. Good. I feel greatly relieved.
<es>

@300
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What's the matter?"
<es>

@301
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are gonna stay inside all today, right?"
<es>

@302
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, I was going to. What are you thinking? Are you gonna come in and stay in my room?"
<es>

@305
<en>{Mizuki}\n"If so, that is not gonna happen. The boys are not allowed here, you know? Though one of your friends with A sneaks in here all the time."
<es>

@306
<en>That's Appo. Soon or later, he will be in a big trouble. Or maybe, he does need a trouble simply to learn a lesson...
<es>

@309
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Will you want to come in for a while? Oh, by the way No sex today, okay?"
<es>

@310
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will pass that too. I was gonna play with Appo in our room anyway."
<es>

@311
<en>I know Mizuki will follow me if I say I'll go and check the ocean. But I don't need her as I plan to be back right away.
<es>

@314
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, I see. I understand building brotherhood is important sometimes."
<es>

@315
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You got it."
<es>

@318
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I will stay here and have a good time with other girls myself today."
<es>

@319
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It sounds better. I want to join too."
<es>

@322
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No way. You will see them at lunch, right?"
<es>

@323
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's right. Let's get together then."
<es>

@324
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Okay."
<es>

@325
<en>Something bothers me. I will get it over with as quickly as possible. Maybe later on, I may get lucky with Mizuki... Yeah. Good idea.
<es>

@331
<en>The water roars with turbulent moves. The high waves even cover my sight to the front.
<es>

@332
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, my God..."
<es>

@333
<en>It is a totally different sea from what I saw yesterday. It is no longer blue in color - - it's muddy, thick gray. It even gives me a wistful feeling.
<es>

@334
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I doubt they are coming on such a day."
<es>

@335
<en>I don't think they even want to come on such a fucked-up day. If they don't come, that's perfectly fine.
<es>

@336
<en>Actually, it's better that way.
<es>

@337
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is that?"
<es>

@338
<en>I see a fish boat out there, and its top of the ship climbs onto the rock.
<es>

@339
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It looks bad. The wind may have driven it away here."
<es>

@340
<en>It's better to tell somebody. Because it may get pushed away and hit somewhere soon.
<es>

@341
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah...!"
<es>

@342
<en>That moment I see something moving in and out of the waves.
<es>

@343
<en>It could have easily been overlooked. But because I was staring at the water, I was able to notice it.
<es>

@344
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The dolphin? The same as yesterday?"
<es>

@345
<en>I try to see it more carefully. It is a dolphin. But there is only one.
<es>

@346
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why today? Did he come alone?"
<es>

@347
<en>Again, I got a very funny feeling. Wait a minute.
<es>

@348
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is he looking for there?"
<es>

@349
<en>The dolphin is not moving much, just swimming around the same spot.
<es>

@350
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is there something out there?"
<es>

@351

@354
<en>I see another dolphin by the rock where the boat gets on.
<es>

@355
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is the other one doing there?"
<es>

@356
<en>Shit. She gets stuck in the inlet.
<es>

@357
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The fish boat must close it up."
<es>

@358
<en>And the other dolphin gets trapped in the tiny space.
<es>

@359
<en>The turbulent waves keep hitting the dolphin against the rock. She is completely trapped - no way to get out.
<es>

@360
<en>{Dolphin}\n(She squeaks loud.)
<es>

@361
<en>I still can hear her cry in agony in the midst of the rumbling of the storm.

@362
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shit. It doesn't look good. She got to be out of there."
<es>

@363
<en>She is not gonna make it if this goes on. I got to get her out of there.
<es>

@364
<en>Plus, the boat is gonna break into pieces. If that happens, it is gonna hurt her pretty bad.
<es>

@365

@415
<en>{Appo-}\n"But this is a pretty big dolphin. How are we gonna get her out of there?"
<es>

@416
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The only way is we scoot over the fish boat first and make the space for her to get out."
<es>

@417
<en>Luckily, the boat is rocking around on the waves. So it must be pretty wobbly now.
<es>

@418
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah. Maybe we could do it."
<es>

@419
<en>We could do it by taking advantage of the current of the rocking waves.
<es>

@420
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We just push it along with the current of waves. But..."
<es>

@421
<en>That's where the wave hits hard. So if a big wave comes, that's it - - they take us.

@477
<en>Grating sound. Wham!!
<es>

@478

<es>

@479

<es>

@480

<es>

@822
<en>The alchemy is juts like magic. It's even believed to make one ageless and immortal. If this is true, heeling the legs should be a no-brainer, right?
<es>

@823
<en>But Mr.Miya shakes his head.
<es>

@826

<es>

<en>{Kazushi}\n"Artificial legs..."
<es>

@838

<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"All we can do is to wait for her recovery."
<es>

@842
<en>Then I ask them about what still bothers me...
<es>

@843
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So Mizuki is not gonna be able to swim any more?"
<es>

@846
<en>Mr.Miya looks down and away. His expression tells me the answer I did not want to hear.
<es>

@847
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"No. Not like that. With artificial legs, however, she may be able to swim, to some degree."
<es>

@848
<en>His comment pushes me to despair again. I tremble with rage.
<es>

@849
<en>{Kazushi}\n"To some degree..."
<es>

@850
<en>No! Not to some degree. Mizuki got to swim with the dolphins in the seas all around the world.
<es>

@851
<en>The God gave her the ability to swim. It's gifted. I just can't think of her losing it.
<es>

@852
<en>But Mizuki is losing that God-giving talent.
<es>

@853
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No way..."
<es>

@854
<en>I mutter in anger welling up from within.
<es>

@857
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Pardon?"
<es>

@858
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No way!"
<es>

@859
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I said no fuckin' way!!"
<es>

@860
<en>I grab Mr.Miya by the collar and push him against the wall.
<es>

@866
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Ugh...!!"
<es>

@867
<en>Being hit on the wall, Mr.Miya grunts. I stare at Mr.Miya with his glasses off the face, and he looks blurred.
<es>

@870
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@871
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why?! Why is it that Mizuki has to go through this?! She did nothing wrong!!"
<es>

@872
<en>That's right. Mizuki did nothing wrong There is no fucking reason Mizuki has to face this.
<es>

@873
<en>What the fuck is going on?!
<es>

@874
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No way I can accept that she is not gonna swim again. Please help her. Cure her legs!! Please!!"
<es>

@877
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"But..."
<es>

@878
<en>Mr.Miya remains silent, which makes me mad again.
<es>

@879
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, you are a fuckin' alchemist, right? Alchemy helps people right? Please help her!"
<es>

@880
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will do anything! I mean anything..."
<es>

@882
<en>I can hardly see things with tears. I let go my hands of Mr.Miya and drop to my knees.
<es>

@883
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please. I will do anything...I don't want anything for myself...so please..."
<es>

@886
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@887
<en>I find myself squatting on the floor. Mr.Miya put his arms around me, looking at me with his lip a bit bleeding.
<es>

@888
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry..."
<es>

@889
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"That's okay. I am sorry I cannot be any help..."
<es>

@890
<en>I know. No one is to blame. Because who suffers most is...
<es>

@891
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does Mizuki know about this?"
<es>

@894
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"We gave her a pain killer. It is going to put her sleep for a day."
<es>

@895
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Her pains will go away in a few days and she will gain consciousness afterwards."
<es>

@896
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Then we will have to tell her about her legs."
<es>

@897
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@898
<en>It's excruciating for anyone to tell her that her legs will no longer move. But we can't keep that a secret from her. Who should tell her then...?
<es>

@899
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will tell her."
<es>

@900
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"What?"
<es>

@901
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will tell her about her legs."
<es>

@902
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"But it is going to be a very touch job..."
<es>

@903
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know, but she is the one who suffers most."
<es>

@904
<en>Since no one can understand what it is like to be her...
<es>

@905
<en>I wish I could. But I know it's not possible.
<es>

@906
<en>And yet I want to carry her pain with her.
<es>

@907
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will tell Mizuki."
<es>

@910
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Okay. Please do."
<es>

@911
<en>This is horrible. Am I having a dream? I've been dreaming until yesterday? Or am I in a dream now?
<es>

@912
<en>I wish everything was just a dream. But reality will hit tomorrow. Yes - tomorrow I will tell her everything.
<es>

@920
<en>Next day - -
<es>

@921
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How pathetic am I! Being hospitalized? An accident in the sea? Gee..."
<es>

@922
<en>Mizuki looks fine, as Mr.Miya said she'd no longer has a pain. She has been asleep since she fell unconscious in the accident.
<es>

@923
<en>It is good that she no longer has to experience a physical pain.
<es>

@924
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Were you okay, Kazushi?"
<es>

@925
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. I was fine. I only got scratches...thanks to you."
<es>

@926
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Good. Otherwise, my injury would not have any point. Right?"
<es>

@927
<en>Her cheerful voice - - it's so strange that I can even see her in the hospital. Has she been cured already?
<es>

@928
<en>Mr.Miya's alchemy might have worked better than he thought.
<es>

@929
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How are you feeling?"
<es>

@930
<en>I feel scared to ask her. I don't want to wake up from a happy dream.
<es>

@931
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Not bad...I can't believe I slept the whole day."
<es>

@932
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So everything feels okay?"
<es>

@934
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh...my legs are a bit..."
<es>

@935
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Legs?"
<es>

@936
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't know why, but I can't move my legs at all. Is it because of the pain killer or anesthesia I got?"
<es>

@937
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@938
<en>I am thrown into darkness. Her legs are not cured. It was not a dream.
<es>

@939
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi...Did the doctor tell you anything about my legs?"
<es>

@940
<en>I can see worries and confusions in her eyes. I wish I could cheer her up by driving her worries away, as opposed to giving more worries.
<es>

@941
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi...?"
<es>

@942
<en>My silence exacerbates the situation.
<es>

@944
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki, listen."
<es>

@945
<en>My voice trembles. Suddenly, her face falls.
<es>

@946
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What is it? You are not gonna propose to me now, are you? It's a little too early."
<es>

@947
<en>She says with a mischievous look and I know now --
<es>

@948
<en>Mizuki already knows something.
<es>

@949
<en>Mizuki doesn't usually behave this mischievously. However, she must have hope - - hope that one day she can still...
<es>

@950
<en>Then I have to rob her of that hope.
<es>

@951
<en>{Kazushi}\n"About your legs..."
<es>

@952
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, so did the doctor say something? What is going on? I don't feel anything."
<es>

@953
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It feels like these are not my legs. They are going to be cured, right? How long will it take?"
<es>

@954
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That..."
<es>

@955
<en>I can't look her straight in the eye. She must have trust that I won't say anything disappointing.
<es>

@956
<en>I now have to betray her trust in me.
<es>

@957
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Your legs..."
<es>

@958
<en>How do I tell her? I've been thinking all day since yesterday about how to say it. But I'm still struck and speechless.
<es>

@959
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So is this that bad?"
<es>

@960
<en>Mizuki sounds very sad. My silence worries her more. I got to tell her.
<es>

@961
<en>But what if I tell her the truth?
<es>

@962
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right...that's bad."
<es>

@963
<en>I clench my teeth.
<es>

@964
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How long will it take to cure? How long is the rehab? The legs are gonna move again right?"
<es>

@965
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No..."
<es>

@966
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What?"
<es>

@967
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Your legs are not gonna move any more."
<es>

@968
<en>Momentarily, silence embraces us. Then, Mizuki smiles back to me.
<es>

@969
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You got to be kidding!"
<es>

@970
<en>I have no idea what to tell her. I wanted to say they will be cured, but...
<es>

@971
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@972
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You are not, huh..."
<es>

@973
<en>Maybe, it hasn't really hit her yet. Because instead of crying,she is smiling slightly.
<es>

@974
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The doctor says it's better to see other doctors soon. They may be able to figure out some better treatment, you know."
<es>

@975
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I see. But I still don't understand."
<es>

@976
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Because they do look all right to me. Nothing seems different..."
<es>

@977
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mr.Miya used alchemy to clean the injury on your leg, but..."
<es>

@978
<en>{Mizuki}\n"He couldn't make them move..."
<es>

@979
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No."
<es>

@980
<en>Mizuki keeps silent for a while. I also couldn't say anything because what else can I say to her?
<es>

@981
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I cannot swim any more, can I?"
<es>

@982
<en>She mutters under her breath.
<es>

@983
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They don't know."
<es>

@984
<en>I give her a vague answer. But Mizuki gets the real message.
<es>

@985
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I see."
<es>

@986
<en>Mizuki lies on her back, covering her eyes with her hands.
<es>

@987
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@988
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry. I need time..."
<es>

@989
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@991
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@992
<en>Mizuki remains still.
<es>

@993
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't swim any more, huh..."
<es>

@994
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@995
<en>I put my hand on her shoulder. Then Mizuki holds my hand.
<es>

@996
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Please hold my hand."
<es>

@997
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@998
<en>I hold her hand tight. Mizuki grabs my hand tightly, too.
<es>

@999
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't believe this is happening to me. I wish I could have been swimming more."
<es>

@1000
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@1001
<en>I can't help but hold her tight with both arms. Her body feels like a soulless, empty feelings of sorrow.
<es>

@1002
<en>I hug her tight as if to keep her soul from flying out.
<es>

@1003
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, too tight..."
<es>

@1004
<en>Then, Mizuki puts her arms around me and hugs me really tight.
<es>

@1005
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I...I..."
<es>

@1006
<en>I am gonna get your legs to move. That is what I really wanted to say to her, but...
<es>

@1007
<en>I am just a student. I am not a doctor, nor an alchemist. All I can do is to tell her the truth - -brutal truth.
<es>

@1008
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry..."
<es>

@1009
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Don't be, Kazushi."
<es>

@1010
<en>That day, Mizuki never cried nor complained.
<es>

@1011
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Please come see me tomorrow."
<es>

@1012
<en>She has the right to grudge against me for what happened to her, but she just asks me to come again. I give her a smile as that's all I can do for now.
<es>

@1013
<en>Is there anything I can do for Mizuki?
<es>

@1020
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"You told her, huh?..."
<es>

@1021
<en>I stopped by Mr.Miya's since I didn't want to go home straight.
<es>

@1022
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki just kept smiling. I know she is terribly hurt and sad."
<es>

@1023
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Maybe she doesn't feel real. But the fact that she is no longer able to walk will gradually torture her."
<es>

@1024
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right."
<es>

@1025
<en>Mizuki will have to face the reality - reality that her legs don't help her do all the activity.
<es>

@1026
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"There will be more pain and more sorrow as she lives each day. Then what Mizuki needs is your support, Kazushi."
<es>

@1027
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"You are the only one that can support her, Kazushi."
<es>

@1028
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. What can I do for her? How can I support her? I don't know..."
<es>

@1031
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"When I was treating her legs in the hospital, Mizuki was calling your name in her sleep."
<es>

@1032
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My name?"
<es>

@1033
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"She must have been worried about you in the accident."
<es>

@1034
<en>{Kazushi}\n"God..."
<es>

@1035
<en>Mizuki was worried about me, not herself. What a pathetic man I am! I let her go through this...
<es>

@1036
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I go to see Mizuki tomorrow?"
<es>

@1037
<en>All I can do for Mizuki is to be with her. I can listen and share her pain.
<es>

@1038
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Of course. Go visit her every day. She must feel quite lonely."
<es>

@1039
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes."
<es>

@1040
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"She may be really down tomorrow. Stay with her."
<es>

@1041
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes."
<es>

@1042
<en>I vow to live my life for her. I will do anything for her -- anything that even seems impossible to do.
<es>

@1047
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh...I am so hungry."
<es>

@1048
<en>Mizuki seems fine next day as well. She grumbles for hunger.
<es>

@1049
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What would you want to eat?"
<es>

@1050
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm? Something good."
<es>

@1051
<en>A quick answer.
<es>

@1052
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The meals are terrible here. People here in clinic don't have to make the food as bad as big hospitals."
<es>

@1053
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't agree more. Something good to eat? Do you want me to cook?"
<es>

@1054
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, no!?"
<es>

@1055
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What do you mean "oh no"?"
<es>

@1056
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well..."
<es>

@1057
<en>Oh, I know what she wants to say. She doesn't think anything I cook is worth eating
<es>

@1058
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right. I will go fix something for your lunch. I hope they let me use their kitchen here."
<es>

@1059
<en>I got to show her what I can do for cooking. I've got an ace in the hole.
<es>

@1060
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Fixing my lunch? Not enough time, Kazushi."
<es>

@1061
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It won't take long. Just an hour would be enough."
<es>

@1062
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, I mean not enough time for me to accept your offer."
<es>

@1063
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about? Just hold on, and I will get you the best meal you've ever tasted in your life."
<es>

@1064
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh...Kazushi... Don't be so desperate."
<es>

@1065
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You just wait hungry! You will thank me a million!"
<es>

@1068
<en>{Mizuki}\n"This is good..."
<es>

@1069
<en>Mizuki seems stunned.
<es>

@1070
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good, huh? I am pretty good at making fried rice omelets."
<es>

@1071
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You can never judge a book by its cover, huh? I never knew you cook this good."
<es>

@1072
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, a limited offer..."
<es>

@1073
<en>{Mizuki}\n"This means you are a better cook than I am...? No, that's not good..."
<es>

@1074
<en>Finally, she starts to grumble.
<es>

@1075
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait! Can you cook, Mizuki?"
<es>

@1076
<en>I have seen her in the kitchen before but...
<es>

@1077
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Of course I can. I will fix something for you next time...far next time..."
<es>

@1078
<en>She sneers at herself as she may think of her legs. She realizes it may take some time for her to get on her feet in the kitchen.
<es>

@1079
<en>Or it may not be possible for her to get on her feet for good.
<es>

@1080
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No rush, Mizuki. I will wait and look forward to the day you cook for me."
<es>

@1081
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes. You are right. I'm gonna have to study cooking then."
<es>

@1082
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Study? Now?"
<es>

@1083
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes! I can do it. Nothing new. Just review, you know?"
<es>

@1084
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@1085
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Don't give me such a suspicious look."
<es>

@1086
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I got you! We are even now."
<es>

@1087
<en>{Mizuki}\n"God, you naughty boy!! Naughty boys are not popular with girls, you know?"
<es>

@1088
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It doesn't matter as long as I am popular with one girl."
<es>

@1089
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Whoa..."
<es>

@1090
<en>Suddenly, both of us find ourselves speechless. I may have sounded a little too cool and a bit embarrassing...
<es>

@1091
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1092
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh...Why don't you get some rest?"
<es>

@1093
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Y-Yes...What about you? Are you okay? You look a little tired."
<es>

@1094
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am fine. I got enough sleep last night. If I have to do, three days with no sleep - I can still survive."
<es>

@1095
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You can also sleep here with me, if you want. But no sex..."
<es>

@1096
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know..."
<es>

@1097
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Good night."
<es>

@1099
<en>While listening to Mizuki's sleep-breath, I sigh with relief.
<es>

@1100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I have to be strong and look strong."
<es>

@1101
<en>I got to be a strong man! I can't look tired before Mizuki. I got to keep smiling because Mizuki tries to keep smiling.
<es>

@1102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A strong man, huh...?"
<es>

@1103
<en>Heh Heh...let me scribble on her face. Hmm...Yes, this proves I am a strong man.
<es>

@1104
<en>..................
<es>

@1105
<en>............
<es>

@1106
<en>Later on, she became really mad at me...
<es>

@1111
<en>{Mizuki}\n"A strong man? This is such a childish act!"
<es>

@1112
<en>She is still upset about yesterday.
<es>

@1113
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry..."
<es>

@1114
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, give me your face. I got a marker from a nurse."
<es>

@1115
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Retaliation?"

<es>

@1117
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I give up."
<es>

@1118
<en>I decide to give in to her demand...
<es>

@1119

<es>

@1120

@1121

@1122
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No! No way!"
<es>

@1124
<en>Rattling sound.
<es>

@1125
<en>Suddenly, the door opens.
<es>

@1128
<en>{Pierre}\n"What are you guys doing?"
<es>

@1129
<en>{Appo-}\n"You look good, Mizuki."
<es>

@1130
<en>It's the guys standing at the door.
<es>

@1131
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Welcome!"
<es>

@1132
<en>They enter in a rather hesitant manner, though they didn't knock first.
<es>

@1133
<en>{Pierre}\n"We heard you two screaming in here...What? What's on your face, Kazushi? It says "Mizuki is my life"."
<es>

@1134
<en>On my face?
<es>

@1135
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What the hell were you writing on me?"
<es>

@1136
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So what?"
<es>

@1137
<en>{Daigo}\n"Two idiots."
<es>

@1138
<en>{Appo-}\n"Hey, knock it off, guys. Any other patients in here?"
<es>

@1139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is a private room."
<es>

@1140
<en>{Daigo}\n"Not bad."
<es>

@1141
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I like this room. Pretty cozy."
<es>

@1142
<en>Mizuki suddenly becomes quiet.
<es>

@1143
<en>{Pierre}\n"Uh...are we interrupting something here?"
<es>

@1144
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, it is good you guys came. It's just that it is better to knock first. You don't have what's called courtesy, etiquette, good manner, you know?"
<es>

@1145
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hahaha"
<es>

@1147
<en>Someone knocks on the door.
<es>

@1148
<en>This time...
<es>

@1150
<en>{Haruka}\n"How are you, Mizuki?"
<es>

@1151
<en>{Rin}\n"You guys are here too."
<es>

@1152
<en>A few girls also come by to see Mizuki. The Mizuki's room gets crowded, suddenly.
<es>

@1153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All the visits overlapped, huh?"
<es>

@1154
<en>{Sakura}\n"We were just talking that today might be good day to see Mizuki."
<es>

@1155
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wait. What is "Mizuki is my love"on your face for?"
<es>

@1156
<en>All the girls, then, look into my face.
<es>

@1157
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's Mizuki..."
<es>

@1158
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi loves me so much that he even gets this mysterious message to appear on his face."
<es>

@1159
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, guys. You were not making out or anything in the clinic, are you?"
<es>

@1160
<en>{Mizuki}\n"We are not!"
<es>

@1161
<en>{Appo-}\n"Inside a private room of the hospital....Hmm... I've never thought about this situation...This may be good."
<es>

@1162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What situation? What's good?"
<es>

@1163
<en>I hope he and Kazuko won't get hospitalized just for the wrong reason.
<es>

@1164
<en>{Rin}\n"Mizuki, are you eating okay? Do you like the food here?"
<es>

@1165
<en>Rin is concerned about Mizuki's balanced diet.
<es>

@1166
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Honestly, not really. I would rather like the fried rise omelet Kazushi cooked for me."
<es>

@1167
<en>{Sakura}\n"What? The fried rice omelet? Kazushi cooked it?"
<es>

@1168
<en>{Rin}\n"Wow, Kazushi. You are so kind!"
<es>

@1169
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sort of tit for tat, you know?"
<es>

@1170
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The omelet was shockingly good."
<es>

@1171
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shockingly? Uh...Are you jealous? Is it because you can't cook?"
<es>

@1172
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes, I can! It's so frustrating that I can't show it to you now."
<es>

@1173
<en>Everyone around us looks astonished by our conversation and they all smile.
<es>

@1174
<en>{Ran}\n"You seem to be feeling good, Mizuki."
<es>

@1175
<en>{Pierre}\n"You can come to school in the 2nd semester then."
<es>

@1176
<en>The summer is drawing to an end soon. It's only a few days away before the 2nd semester begins. But...
<es>

@1177
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't think I can go to school soon."
<es>

@1178
<en>There is no telling when Mizuki will go to school. It will take a fair amount of time to get her a wheelchair. She will also need more medical check-ups.
<es>

@1179
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I may have to go to another hospital in the mainland."
<es>

@1180
<en>{Sakura}\n"So will you be able to walk again?"
<es>

@1182
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1183
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@1184
<en>We all stand in stunned silence. So everyone knows about her legs.
<es>

@1185
<en>{Sakura}\n"What?"
<es>

@1186
<en>{Ran}\n"You stupid."
<es>

@1188
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's okay, Sakura. They may find out some better ways to treat my legs. Who knows?"
<es>

@1189
<en>{Rin}\n"Yeah, right! There may be a lot of good doctors in the mainland."
<es>

@1190
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's right. Medical science makes progress everyday."
<es>

@1192
<en>{Appo-}\n"Yeah. My grandpa was told by the doctor that he'd only have three months to live, but then went to a bigger hospital where he was treated. It turned out that he got completely cured in the three months in the end."
<es>

@1194
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? That's a great story!"
<es>

@1195
<en>A good story gives hope. But too much expectation may turn things around to be of no avail. So it's hard to balance out.
<es>

@1196
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well, I will keep expectations not so high. Besides, I know their food is not so good."
<es>

@1197
<en>{Kazushi}\n"In the big hospital, I might have the trouble to cook for you."
<es>

@1198
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Before all things, Kazushi, you have to go to school. You can't go with me."
<es>

@1199
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If you go, I will go. Missing a few days is not gonna kill me."
<es>

@1200
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You will never know how long it will take. It may not be a few days."
<es>

@1201
<en>Mizuki might get transferred to a bigger hospital for treatment.
<es>

@1202
<en>I don't mind going with her anywhere and everywhere if I have to. But Mr.Miya said the outlook of her condition is hopeless.
<es>

@1203
<en>{Haruka}\n"Can't you go outside?"
<es>

@1204
<en>{Mizuki}\n"They will get me a wheelchair soon. Then I can go outside."
<es>

@1205
<en>{Rin}\n"When that day comes, let's go out and walk together. Okay?"
<es>

@1206
<en>{Ran}\n"A good idea! It's still hot outside now, but will cool down soon."
<es>

@1207
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, yeah. The summer break is getting over soon."
<es>

@1208
<en>The summer is over soon. This is supposed to be a great summer. But why? Why did it have to turn so ugly?
<es>

@1209
<en>Everyone thinks that way and this thought puts us all in silence.
<es>

@1210
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Okay, take me out for a walk when it gets cool down outside."
<es>

@1211
<en>Mizuki breaks the silence by saying cheerfully,
<es>

@1212
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's a good idea."
<es>

@1213
<en>Why did this thing have to happen? I want to wake up from this horrible nightmare.
<es>

@1218
<en>We are outside the clinic.
<es>

@1221
<en>{Pierre}\n"We are fine here."
<es>

@1226
<en>{Appo-}\n"Go back and keep making out with her."
<es>

@1227
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. Even without your permission."
<es>

@1228
<en>I am glad to talk to my friends as I have not talked to virtually anyone else except Mizuki lately.
<es>

@1233
<en>{Rin}\n"It was good to see Mizuki looks fine."
<es>

@1234
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She is a very strong girl."
<es>

@1235
<en>Definitely, she is. She never shows us her sad look. She never has -- even to me.
<es>

@1236
<en>Because of that, in fact, I am more worried about her.
<es>

@1241
<en>{Haruka}\n"What about you, Kazushi? You have been with her all day, right? Are you getting enough sleep?"
<es>

@1242
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm fine. All I can do is to stay with her."
<es>

@1246
<en>{Ran}\n"Let me know if you need us for anything. We will give you a discount."
<es>

@1247
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Still charging, huh?"
<es>

@1248
<en>For some reason, Ran's never-changed-wacky-personality eases my mind.
<es>

@1249
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will let you know, if need be."
<es>

@1252
<en>{Ran}\n"You can count on us."
<es>

@1257
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi, I've been meaning to give you this."
<es>

@1258
<en>Daigo gives me a little paper bag.
<es>

@1259
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is this?"
<es>

@1260
<en>Inside is that little pendant I bought for Mizuki.
<es>

@1261
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is..."
<es>

@1268
<en>{Pierre}\n"Mizuki dropped it right before she jumped in the sea to save you."
<es>

@1269
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@1270
<en>{Appo-}\n"Give it back to her."
<es>

@1271
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks, guys."
<es>

@1277
<en>{Haruka}\n"We are going now. Please go back."
<es>

@1278
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks guys."
<es>

@1280
<en>After I see them off, I am headed back to Mizuki's.
<es>

@1286
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1287
<en>When I return, Mizuki is looking out the window. She now looks different from when she was just a while ago. It's a very vacant, non-emotional look.
<es>

@1288
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@1289
<en>I call her name.
<es>

@1291
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, you are already back."
<es>

@1292
<en>She gives me a usual smile. I now know she looks that sad when she is alone. I have to be with her as long as I can.
<es>

@1293
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I talked a lot today. It feels like it's been a while to see them, though it was only a few days."
<es>

@1294
<en>It is natural she thinks that way. Too many things happened in just a short period of time.
<es>

@1295
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Aren't you tired, Mizuki?"
<es>

@1296
<en>{Mizuki}\n"A little bit. Just lying in bed all the time is rather tiring."
<es>

@1297
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't wait for us to go outside together."
<es>

@1298
<en>We are getting a wheelchair soon, which makes it easy for us to go out there.
<es>

@1299
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Honestly, I don't feel like being in a wheelchair."
<es>

@1300
<en>This is the first time I have ever heard of such a depressing voice from her.
<es>

@1301
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We can go outside though...?"
<es>

@1302
<en>{Mizuki}\n"People worry about me if I am in the wheelchair. I don't want them to keep worrying about me."
<es>

@1303
<en>People know that Mizuki was just an ordinary, active girl only a few days ago.
<es>

@1304
<en>It's only natural for people to sympathize with her.
<es>

@1305
<en>Perhaps I would feel the same way if people gave me too much of concern and sympathy.
<es>

@1306
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But you don't have to think that way. The fact of matter is you are the one that worries too much about them so that they don't worry about you."
<es>

@1307
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah. You are right. It's so difficult."
<es>

@1308
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, just relax. Don't boggle your mind. I am with you."
<es>

@1309
<en>Mizuki gives me a feeble smile.
<es>

@1310
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi. Please don't push yourself too hard. I don't want you to feel obligated. You have your own life."
<es>

@1311
<en>She sounds gloomy again.
<es>

@1312
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about?"
<es>

@1314
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You don't have to stay with me. It's too much for you."
<es>

@1315
<en>What makes her feel that way? Is it because she talked to the friends today? Mizuki has never sounded so negative.
<es>

@1316
<en>But her behavior is only natural. Now is time I got to be strong for her.
<es>

@1317
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Too much? Never! I want to be with you, Mizuki."
<es>

@1318
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Don't push yourself too hard."
<es>

@1319
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not. It's pretty natural that man wants to be with the woman he loves, right? Besides, you are my first...you know?"
<es>

@1320
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1321
<en>Both of us are flushed.
<es>

@1322
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Thank you. I'm so happy...even if that is not true."
<es>

@1323
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It is true."
<es>

@1325
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But if you feel that I am too much for you and you want to run away, I want you to tell me. Because I don't want you to feel obligated. Well, if you want to run away, it is not too difficult for you to do that."
<es>

@1327
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't run after you anymore."
<es>

@1328
<en>Mizuki gives me a sad smile, which causes a great deal of sorrow in my heart.
<es>

@1329
<en>{Mizuki}\n"If my legs were fine then, I'll chase after you. But that is not possible now. Hahaha."
<es>

@1330
<en>Mizuki looks discouraged, which must be attributed to the meeting with her friends earlier.
<es>

@1331
<en>She may have compared herself in bed all day to her friends.
<es>

@1332
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah."
<es>

@1333
<en>I take that necklace out of my pocket and put it around her neck.
<es>

@1334
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah! You found it?!"
<es>

@1335
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You knew you'd lost it, huh?"
<es>

@1336
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Of course. I was touching it everyday. But I couldn't tell you that I'd lost it. It was my lucky charm."
<es>

@1337
<en>Probably, she wanted to tell me the accident happened because she had lost her pendant.
<es>

@1338
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't lose it."
<es>

@1339
<en>But if this is really a lucky charm, I want it to protect her.
<es>

@1340
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes. Thank you."
<es>

@1341
<en>I know it is going to take some time for Mizuki to feel better. But I will be right by her side and help her.
<es>

@1346
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right! Take it down!"
<es>

@1349
<en>{Pierre}\n"I'm okay here."
<es>

@1354
<en>{Appo-}\n"Easy, easy"
<es>

@1359
<en>{Daigo}\n"There we go!"
<es>

@1362
<en>We finally got her wheelchair, which we put down on the beach with Mizuki in it today. This wheelchair is going to replace Mizuki's legs for a while.
<es>

@1363
<en>Or a long time...
<es>

@1364
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm. It's difficult to make it move on the sands."
<es>

@1365
<en>{Pierre}\n"I wish this one had a four-wheel drive engine on it. Don't they have one like that?"
<es>

@1366
<en>{Ran}\n"I wouldn't' think so. Do you know what a four-wheel drive means anyway, Mr.?"
<es>

@1367
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah. 4WD. Right?"
<es>

@1368
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm. The smell of the ocean...It's been a while."
<es>

@1369
<en>It doesn't seem Mizuki is much traumatized by the accident in the sea. She simply enjoys being by the sea and feels relaxed.
<es>

@1370
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How are you feeling now?"
<es>

@1371
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I feel really good. It feels like my brain being stimulated by the wind and smell of the sea."
<es>

@1372
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah?"
<es>

@1373
<en>We might as well come outside more often then. It's good for her health too.
<es>

@1374
<en>{Dolphin}\nThe dolphins cry.
<es>

@1375
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh!"
<es>

@1376
<en>Mizuki immediately notices the two dolphins looking out here from shallow water.
<es>

@1377
<en>{Dolphin}\nThe dolphins squeak loud.
<es>

@1378
<en>{Mizuki}\n"They came here again! Even after the accident!"
<es>

@1379
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hold on, Mizuki."
<es>

@1380
<en>I lift up her wheelchair and take it out by the water. But still, the dolphins are not reachable.
<es>

@1381
<en>{Dolphin}\nThe dolphins squeak.
<es>

@1382
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry, I can't get there. But thank you for coming to see us. You guys look fine."
<es>

@1383
<en>{Dolphin}\nThe dolphins reply.
<es>

@1384
<en>The dolphins cry as if they try to comfort Mizuki. She must be quite irritated not being able to jump in the water for them.
<es>

@1385
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry. I wish I could swim with you guys again."
<es>

@1386
<en>But...no further words come out from her mouth.
<es>

@1387
<en>To Mizuki, a few meters apart from them are an infinite distance. With a sorrowful look, Mizuki stares at the dolphins.
<es>

@1388
<en>Today is the last day of the summer holiday and our break is over.
<es>

@1395
<en>{Mei}\n"Good morning, everyone. Long time, no see....or maybe not."
<es>

@1396
<en>Even after the summer break, we feel nothing really changed in school since we all live in the same building.
<es>

@1397
<en>Well, not exactly. Something did change.
<es>

@1398
<en>{Mei}\n"Mizuki is not here with us today. As you all know, she got a horrible accident during the summer."
<es>

@1401
<en>Mizuki is not in our classroom. There is an empty chair right next to me.
<es>

@1402
<en>{Rin}\n"When will Mizuki return to school?"
<es>

@1403
<en>{Mei}\n"That may take some time. It might be quite difficult for her to adjust a new life style. So it'd be great if you could help her out."
<es>

@1404
<en>{Rin}\n"We are happy to do that."
<es>

@1405

<es>

@1406
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh...today may not be a good time..."
<es>

@1410
<en>Ever since she met the dolphins, she has gotten blues again. So it may be better to give her time for herself.
<es>

@1415
<en>{Pierre}\n"She must be tired from going outside yesterday."
<es>

@1416
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. It's better we just let her get some rest today."
<es>

@1420
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Okay, why don't we just take a rain check today and wait until he tells us how she is doing?"
<es>

<es>

@1426

@1435
<en>I can hear a small voice from inside. I look inside through the opening of the door.
<es>

@1439
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ugh...This..."
<es>

@1440
<en>Mizuki is trying to get up on the bed. However, she can only get the strength from the upper part of her body, not from her legs.
<es>

@1441
<en>It looks like her legs no longer being part of her.
<es>

@1442
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Damn. I can't move these legs."
<es>

@1444
<en>She hits her own legs with her hands hard. But it doesn't seem it hurts her at all.
<es>

@1446
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Damn, legs! You don't feel anything!!"
<es>

@1448
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Just once - - only once. Let me get up on my feet..."
<es>

@1450
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Come on! Move! You stick to my god damn body! So move it!"
<es>

@1452
<en>She bursts out her frustration. However, neither of her legs moves. She hits the legs again.
<es>

@1454
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Useless, fuckin' legs!!"
<es>

@1456
<en>Mizuki keeps beating her legs intensely. Normally, you can't keep hurting your own body like that. She does it - - because her legs don't feel anything.
<es>

@1457
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki...!"
<es>

@1458
<en>I can let her do that any longer. I jump in the room. That moment, she loses balance.
<es>

@1462
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah!!"
<es>

@1463
<en>Mizuki falls from the bed.
<es>

@1464
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki!!"
<es>

@1465
<en>I lift her up. It seems her elbow and shoulder are hurt.
<es>

@1468
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh...Kazushi...Ha Ha Ha. It didn't work."
<es>

@1469
<en>Mizuki gives me a usual smile with teary eyes. My heart hurts.
<es>

@1470
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did you hurt here?"
<es>

@1473
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah. I hurt my shoulder and elbow. They are a bit throbbing."
<es>

@1474
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let me see them."
<es>

@1475
<en>Her elbow is a little sore. I don't see anything on her shoulder.
<es>

@1476
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's have the doctor see them."
<es>

@1477
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm fine. I can tell how bad it is by the pain. That's how our body works."
<es>

@1478
<en>Then Mizuki looks down at her legs.
<es>

@1481
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But these legs don't feel anything...So I have no idea. I don't even know how bad my legs hurt when I just fell."
<es>

@1484
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hahaha. I don't get it. They just don't move at all. Like you said, Kazushi, I am now really like a mermaid."
<es>

@1485
<en>As I hold her in my arms, Mizuki is lying on her side. Her legs certainly look like the lower half of the mermaid.
<es>

@1486
<en>Mizuki's legs have lost the beauty and grace that I first witnessed for the first time I saw.
<es>

@1487
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry. Can you get me up to bed?"
<es>

@1489
<en>Mizuki seems to be clam now.
<es>

@1490
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@1491
<en>As Mizuki reaches her hand over to bed, I hold her tight.
<es>

@1494
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah, Kazushi..."
<es>

@1495
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will get you to swim again."
<es>

@1496
<en>Up to now I have intentionally not said these words to her because I knew I could not live up to it.
<es>

@1497
<en>But once I said it, I have got to do it, no matter what.
<es>

@1498
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will make your legs move."
<es>

@1501
<en>{Mizuki}\n"..................Thank you, Kazushi."
<es>

@1503
<en>Mizuki breaks out crying. Holding her tight in my arms, I am determined..."I will make it happen, no matter what".
<es>

@1510
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I set fire on the furnace, and...."
<es>

@1511
<en>As reading the notes, I am busy setting up things for my experiment devices.
<es>

@1512
<en>{Kazushi}\n"And...What's next? Gee, I should have studied more."
<es>

@1513
<en>It's too late to feel sorry. All I have left is alchemy.
<es>

@1514
<en>Having said that, however, I feel depressed by the fact that even Mr.Miya couldn't save her and that I only have very little knowledge about alchemy.
<es>

@1515
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No turning back. I must take some action."
<es>

@1516
<en>Just sitting there won't make any difference. Only time passes by.
<es>

@1517
<en>If I take some action, however, I may be able to make a difference. Something different - maybe good, maybe bad.
<es>

@1518
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nonetheless, nothing is gonna be worse than now."
<es>

@1519
<en>I have got to move on. I must do something. I must make something happen in order to bring Mizuki's legs back to normal.
<es>

@1521
<en>Someone knocks on the door.
<es>

@1522
<en>The knocks echo across the quiet room.
<es>

@1523
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who is it?"
<es>

@1524
<en>Who would that be at this time? Being a bit surprised, I respond with caution.
<es>

@1525
<en>{Mei}\n"It's me...Ms. Ibuki."
<es>

@1526
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah. Ms. Ibuki... Please come in."
<es>

@1527
<en>I sigh with relief. Before getting permission to use this room from Ms. Ibuki, I had to explain to her my whole plan.
<es>

@1531
<en>{Mei}\n"You are really serious about this, huh?"
<es>

@1532
<en>Upon entry, Ms. Ibuki says with a surprised look. I guess she didn't realize I was this serious.
<es>

@1533
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is at least I can do for her."
<es>

@1535
<en>I ask her to take a seat nearby. Sitting in the chair, she looks at a poor set of the laboratory devices I have.
<es>

@1536
<en>Ms. Ibuki looks speechless in surprise. I guess I flunked....
<es>

@1539
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm not sure that's true. I'm sure there are other things you can do for Mizuki. Being with her is definitely one thing."
<es>

@1540
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I continue to do that during the day. I go to school too. So I can only work here at midnight."
<es>

@1543
<en>{Mei}\n"What? Are you gonna be here all night?"
<es>

@1544
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes..."
<es>

@1545
<en>{Mei}\n"When are you gonna sleep then?"
<es>

@1546
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I have not thought much about that...But I think I can handle it."
<es>

@1549
<en>Ms. Ibuki sighs deeply and looks disappointed.
<es>

@1550
<en>{Mei}\n"I now regret letting you use this room. I gave in to your strong request because you seemed desperate for trying to help Mizuki, you know."
<es>

@1551
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I really appreciate your help, Ms. Ibuki. It is gonna take some time, but I know I can do this. I will make something happen..."
<es>

@1554
<en>{Mei}\n"You are wasting your time, Kazushi!"
<es>

@1557
<en>Suddenly, Ms. Ibuki stands up and starts to take my lab devices away.
<es>

@1558
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ms. Ibuki, what are you doing?!"
<es>

@1561
<en>{Mei}\n"It is all useless!"
<es>

@1562
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Useless...? But I got to do something, even though it's useless!"
<es>

@1563
<en>{Mei}\n"You will damage your health. I can't let you keep doing it."
<es>

@1564
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ms. Ibuki..."
<es>

@1565
<en>{Mei}\n"If you want to do it, do it more effectively and efficiently!"
<es>

@1566
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1567
<en>Before I knew it, all my lab devices were being placed differently.
<es>

@1568
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh...Ms. Ibuki...?"
<es>

@1571
<en>{Mei}\n"You can't make anything happen that way, and you are only wasting your time if you are not doing correctly."
<es>

@1572
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, do you mean...?"
<es>

@1573
<en>Ms. Ibuki nods.
<es>

@1576
<en>{Mei}\n"I will help you."
<es>

@1577
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You? Help me?"
<es>

@1580
<en>{Mei}\n"I will be rough with you. So be ready."
<es>

@1581
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ye-Yes! Thank you!"
<es>

@1582
<en>I have no idea how I can do. But I will give it a try.
<es>

@1588
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey! How are you!!"
<es>

@1589
<en>The class is over by noon. I rush into the clinic to see Mizuki.
<es>

@1594
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahh..."
<es>

@1595
<en>Mizuki is awake in bed and gives me a smile.
<es>

@1596
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Glad to see you, Kazushi."
<es>

@1597
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm? What's up, Mizuki?"
<es>

@1598
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Because yesterday..."
<es>

@1599
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yesterday? ...Oh"
<es>

@1600
<en>Oh, shit. That's right. Mizuki cried her heart out on me yesterday. I think she is worried about it.
<es>

@1601
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Am I too much for you?"
<es>

@1602
<en>She says in a thin voice.
<es>

@1603
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No...I told you at many times, Mizuki."
<es>

@1604
<en>{Mizuki}\n"We just started to see each other...then. You must feel burned by me."
<es>

@1605
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. Come on! Stop it."
<es>

@1606
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Tell me the truth, Kazushi. I don't want to be a burden in your life. Please don't make me feel so pathetic."
<es>

@1607
<en>Mizuki sounds humble, and yet aggressive. She looks really upset today.
<es>

@1608
<en>She may not be able to control her emotions that have been repressed for a while.
<es>

@1609
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm really okay alone. I can go anywhere I want to go in the wheelchair."
<es>

@1610
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But you can't go to the beach by yourself?"
<es>

@1611
<en>During low tide, She will need to take long stairs down to the sea.
<es>

@1612
<en>She can't go to the beach and rocky stretch in her wheelchair all by herself. Someone has to push her from behind.
<es>

@1614
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't want to go see the ocean any more."
<es>

@1615
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1616
<en>I can't believe what she said. She doesn't want to go see the ocean?
<es>

@1617
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about? The ocean? Hello?"
<es>

@1618
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't care. I can't swim any more anyway. Looking at the sea only makes me depressed."
<es>

@1619
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Depressed? You were happy the other day."
<es>

@1620
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I realized at that time that there is no place for me in there any more."
<es>

@1621
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Besides, I became crippled because of the sea. I don't want to see it any more!"
<es>

@1622
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But..."
<es>

@1623
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't want to hear any more "buts"! Okay? Don't you understand how I feel? Do you ever?"
<es>

@1624
<en>She shouts in an angry voice. Her dream is not in the sea any more?
<es>

@1625
<en>I understand how she feels. You don't want to go back where the accident occurred.
<es>

@1626
<en>But, I just can't believe that's her true feeling.
<es>

@1627
<en>She has loved the sea. She has loved being in the sea more than being on the ground. She was a real mermaid. But she is telling me she hates to even see it.
<es>

@1628
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are lying."
<es>

@1629
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Am I lying?"
<es>

@1630
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are lying about your feeling I don't believe you don't want to see the ocean any more. That's not true. You never want that."
<es>

@1631
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm not lying! What do you know about how I feel?!"
<es>

@1632
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. Because I know you."
<es>

@1633
<en>Mizuki gives me a fierce, sharp look.
<es>

@1635
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, you don't know how I truly feel! Then, tell me how I feel now! How do I feel about not moving my fucking own legs!!"
<es>

@1636
<en>Being flushed, Mizuki shouts in a rage.
<es>

@1637
<en>How does she feel about not moving my legs? Honestly, I don't know. I can't say I do.
<es>

@1638
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@1639
<en>{Mizuki}\n"See? You can't say anything! So don't ever say you know my feeling!"
<es>

@1640
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry. But, Mizuki..."
<es>

@1642
<en>Someone knocks on the door.
<es>

@1643
<en>Who is there in the midst of this?
<es>

@1646
<en>{Ran}\n"Hello! How are you?"
<es>

@1647
<en>It's Ran. And Haruka is there too.
<es>

@1648
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hmm? Is everything okay?"
<es>

@1649
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahh..."
<es>

@1650
<en>Mizuki falls silent. I see a few other people behind them.
<es>

@1651
<en>{Appo-}\n"What? What? Hey, are we bothering you two, by any chance?"
<es>

@1652
<en>{Pierre}\n"Was Kazushi doing something naughty again, Mizuki? He is not much of a delicate guy, you know."
<es>

@1653
<en>{Daigo}\n"Ah, maybe we should come at some other time?"
<es>

@1654
<en>They are not sure what's going on...
<es>

@1655
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1656
<en>Mizuki turns around and looks down. We fall into an awkward silence. It was a bad timing they came in.
<es>

@1657
<en>It may be better they just leave today.
<es>

@1658
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Guys, look..."
<es>

@1659
<en>I lower my voice at the door not to let Mizuki hear.
<es>

@1660
<en>{Pierre}\n"Bad time, huh?"
<es>

@1661
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah...not now..."
<es>

@1662
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You also leave, Kazushi."
<es>

@1663
<en>Mizuki shouts at my back. Everyone turns their eyes to Mizuki.
<es>

@1664
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry, guys. I know you all worry about me. But please don't. You don't have to worry about me any more. I feel better that way."
<es>

@1665
<en>Everyone looks puzzled by Mizuki's harsh words.
<es>

@1666
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sorry, we barge in on you like this, Mizuki..."
<es>

@1667
<en>{Daigo}\n"Right, we will come at some other time."
<es>

@1668
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You don't have to! Please leave me alone."
<es>

@1669
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki."
<es>

@1670
<en>Not being able to ignore, I cut in. It hurts me to see Mizuki mad uncontrollably.
<es>

@1671
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What?"
<es>

@1672
<en>With teary eyes, Mizuki throws me a fierce look. I am too shocked to say any more.
<es>

@1673
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't ask you guys to leave me alone? You guys can go anywhere you want by yourselves. But I can't!"
<es>

@1674
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't leave here. I can't go anywhere even to be alone. So that's why I asked you to just leave me alone!"
<es>

@1675
<en>Mizuki escalates her anger with her tears almost dropping down on her face.
<es>

@1676
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know, Mizuki. We all know that."
<es>

@1677
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No you don't, Kazushi! You are on their side! You are like them!"
<es>

@1678
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki, please don't say...I am..."
<es>

@1679
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's enough!"
<es>

@1680
<en>Mizuki yells with a strong rejection. It looks like her spirit withering away.
<es>

@1681
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's enough..."
<es>

@1682
<en>And Mizuki mutters under her breath. She is just like a deflating balloon.
<es>

@1683
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Please leave me alone...You, too, Kazushi. Please go. I want to be alone."
<es>

@1684
<en>Mizuki begins to sob.
<es>

@1685
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@1686
<en>No one knows how to approach her. Because we all know even if we do, it will hurt her instead.
<es>

@1687
<en>All we can do is to watch her cry.
<es>

@1694
<en>{Pierre}\n"Sorry, man."
<es>

@1695
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Me too, dude."
<es>

@1696
<en>I also left the room as Mizuki insisted.
<es>

@1701
<en>{Ran}\n"You don't have to worry about us. But what are you going to do now, Kazushi?"
<es>

@1708
<en>{Haruka}\n"Maybe, we just leave her alone?"
<es>

@1709
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. I won't leave her alone."
<es>

@1710
<en>Haruka may be right. But I just can't leave her alone. It doesn't matter how she feels. I want to stay with her.
<es>

@1711
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She doesn't know how much I need her."
<es>

@1712
<en>Sympathy is not what it is. I want to stay with her only because I want her to be with me.
<es>

@1715
<en>{Ran}\n"I guess she has just become stubborn."
<es>

@1716
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not only Mizuki. I am also stubborn."
<es>

@1719
<en>{Haruka}\n"You too?"
<es>

@1720
<en>Yeah, I won't just back off.
<es>

@1723
<en>{Ran}\n"What are you trying to do?"
<es>

@1727
<en>{Appo-}\n"That's okay. Let him do whatever he wants to do."
<es>

@1728
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't just stop like this."
<es>

@1729
<en>I won't leave her alone. I won't.
<es>

@1734
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It should be around here."
<es>

@1735
<en>I am standing by the roadside, where I can see the windows of Mizuki's room. Being here, I am still by her side.
<es>

@1736
<en>Mizuki tells me not to come, so I am not. But I am too stubborn to follow exactly what she said. So this is the way I show my intention - always being with her.
<es>

@1737
<en>She may be mad at me in her room. But she can't say anything as long as I am on the roadside.
<es>

@1738
<en>I get permission from the doctors there, and also from Ms. Ibuki and Mr.Yagami because I won't be able to come to class for a while.
<es>

@1739
<en>All the arrangements are being made.
<es>

@1740
<en>In this way I can be close with Mizuki. She can be reached and I can run over there anytime, if need to be.
<es>

@1741
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am almost like a stalker?"
<es>

@1742
<en>I got to show her how stubborn I am. I can't just back off and say goodbye. I will stay put here.
<es>

@1745
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, is that the time?"
<es>

@1746
<en>I see the light in her room turned off. It is time to sleep.
<es>

@1747
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sweet dreams, Mizuki."
<es>

@1748
<en>Can she sleep well? Is she not having a nightmare?
<es>

@1749
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wish I could be in her dreams."
<es>

@1750
<en>But I have a thing to do while she is asleep.
<es>

@1756
<en>Cracking sound.
<es>

@1757
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!!"

<en>Ms. Ibuki comments sneeringly. She said, usually nothing really happens when errors are made.

@1763
<en>But in my case, something noisy always happen - - like blowing up flasks. Such visible effects come about at each experiment I conduct, but truthfully, they are bit scary.

@1770

<es>

@1777
<en>{Mei}\n"To get the real refined sense, you have to do the testing over and over again. That is the only way,so a mistake has its own value. Making errors is important. You keep trying."

<es>

@1813
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's so cold."
<es>

@1814

<es>

@1816

@1817
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, the sunshine feels so warm. What great the sun is!"

<es>

@1825
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm..."
<es>

@1827
<en>Mizuki opens her eyes slowly. She still feels dozy because she has a very light sleep every night.
<es>

@1828
<en>Especially today, she is not sure how long she slept. It is due to what happened to her and her friends.
<es>

<es>

@1839
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh...!"
<es>

@1840
<en>Mizuki utters in a sheer astonishment.
<es>

@1845
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, are you awake?"
<es>

@1846
<en>It's Kazushi. He is right there on the roadside, broiling fish! He is dispersing the black smoke.
<es>

@1847
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What is he doing there?"
<es>

@1848
<en>What she sees totally shocks her.
<es>

@1849
<en>No anger, no laughter - - no feelings she gets in her mind.

@1850
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I just caught this fish for my breakfast. You want to try this?"
<es>

@1851
<en>{Mizuki}\n"..................what is he talking about?"
<es>

@1852
<en>In no time, some emotion drives up inside Mizuki's - anger.
<es>

@1853
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Mizuki! This tastes great! So good!!"
<es>

@1854
<en>Watching Kazushi chomping baked fish, Mizuki is flying into a rage.
<es>

@1855
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm struggling this much alone. What the hell is he smiling at?"
<es>

@1856
<en>Mizuki looks away from Kazushi and sinks into bed, while covering the sheets over her.
<es>

@1857
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, you stupid, Idiot, asshole!"
<es>

@1858
<en>To her surprise, Mizuki still has strength left to throw curses at him.
<es>

@1865
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@1866
<en>Night falls early in the clinic. The nurse came and pulled the curtains a while ago. Mizuki glances at the window.
<es>

@1867
<en>Before the curtains were drawn, Mizuki saw Kazushi right out the window. Is he still out there?
<es>

@1868
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Stupid Kazushi. I don't care. I am gonna sleep."
<es>

@1869
<en>Mizuki thinks it's wasting time to even think about Kazushi. She tucks herself in.
<es>

@1870

<es>

@1871
<en>..................

<en>............
<es>

@1873
<en>Soon, Mizuki feels drowsy.
<es>

@1874
<en>That night Mizuki was able to have sound sleep.
<es>

@1877
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is she asleep now?"
<es>

@1878
<en>I know Mizuki was still awake until a while ago with the lights off.
<es>

@1879
<en>Because I just sensed she was not sleeping. But I now feel she is gone asleep.
<es>

@1880
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good night, Mizuki."
<es>

@1881
<en>I utter under my breath. No response, of course.
<es>

@1882
<en>I feel happy just to feel she is right there with me. I am not simply here just for her, but I am here so that she doesn't feel lonely.
<es>

@1883
<en>It dawns on me, however, maybe it's me that doesn't want to feel lonely.
<es>

@1884
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I guess because I was told not to visit her any more."
<es>

@1885
<en>I felt so lonely. That's why I am stubbornly acting like a little child.
<es>

@1886
<en>{Kazushi}\n"God...I'm so childish...and so is Mizuki."
<es>

@1887
<en>I know this is not gonna be easy. But if her legs are cured, we can get back to normal.
<es>

@1888
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I have to hang in there."
<es>

@1889
<en>I'm now headed to the lab.
<es>

@1894
<en>It is drizzling. This time of the year, rain brings a new season each time it rains. It's a little chilly today.
<es>

@1896
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, he is wet!"
<es>

@1897
<en>Kazushi is under the eaves of the clinic. But he is not completely sheltering from the rain.
<es>

@1898
<en>He is quite wet with rain, but doesn't seem to care.
<es>

@1899
<en>{Mizuki}\n"He may catch a cold , even in summer."
<es>

@1900
<en>God, stupid. Why doesn't he just come inside the clinic and stay in the waiting room or something?
<es>

@1901
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Is he doing on purpose?"
<es>

@1902
<en>Watching Kazushi, Mizuki is getting irritated and she opens the window.
<es>

@1904
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, Kazushi!"
<es>

@1905
<en>She cries out his name.
<es>

@1908
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Mizuki. What's up? It's strange you say hello to me first."
<es>

@1909
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you doing there, dropping wet? Are you trying to show me how pitiful you are?"
<es>

@1910
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Pitiful?"
<es>

@1911
<en>Kazushi looks perplexed by what she said. It seems he has no idea what she meant.
<es>

@1912
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What the hell are you doing in there? It's raining."
<es>

@1913
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is the only spot I can see your room from."
<es>

@1914
<en>He answers just like that - - nothing special.
<es>

@1915
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Are you trying to show off or something?"
<es>

@1916
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Not really. Rain doesn't bother me at all. It is just water."
<es>

@1917
<en>It appears Kazushi is telling her the truth. That even makes Mizuki worry.
<es>

@1918
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I know it's not so cold now. But if you're soaking wet out there long, you will catch a cold!"
<es>

@1919
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you worried about me, Mizuki?"
<es>

@1920
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? No. No way!"
<es>

@1924
<en>The window slams.
<es>

@1925
<en>Mizuki slams the window. She feels warm on her face. Is her blood up or something?
<es>

@1926
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I kind of feel good after I yell."
<es>

@1927
<en>Without noticing it, I feel refreshed. I wonder how long I didn't talk to Kazushi until today. I peep out of the window.
<es>

@1928
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahh---------------......"
<es>

@1929
<en>Kazushi looks up at the sky with his mouth wide open and drink the rain.
<es>

@1930
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Stupid..."
<es>

@1931
<en>Mizuki tries to suppress a smile.
<es>

@1934
<en>It has become Kazushi's daily routine to work at the lab as soon as the lights turn off in Mizuki's room.
<es>

@1939

<es>

@1940

@1946
<en>{Mei}\n"Mr.Miya tried almost everything. It's clear we can't do better than Mr.Miya. We just need to spend more time trying different things."

<en>{Mei}\n"No rush. You need some rest, Kazushi. Okay?"
<es>

@1953
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, but..."
<es>

@1954
<en>I understand it in my head, but my heart pushes me to work hard and fast so that I can get her legs cured.
<es>

@1955
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, you just follow your own instinct. But I have to warn you that I will stop you from doing it if I see it too much for you. Okay? That's why I am here."

<es>

@1978
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wh-What's going on, guys?"
<es>

@1979
<en>I didn't tell these guys about my work in the lab.
<es>

@1980
<en>Because I just didn't want them to worry about me.
<es>

@1981
<en>That's why I told them I would spend the nights in the clinic.

<es>
