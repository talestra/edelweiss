<en>{Haruka}\n"Huh...?"
<es>

@10
<en>Haruka opened her eyes, but her face still looked vacant. She must still be half asleep.
<es>

@11
<en>{Haruka}\n"What was I..."
<es>

@12
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You fell asleep. Aren't you cold?"
<es>

@13
<en>The wind had picked up quite a bit. The long, green blades of grass swayed, making the path of wind clear as day.
<es>

@14
<en>There's nothing but grassy prairie for as far as the eye can see. It's a magnificent view from here, and one we'd never see in Japan.
<es>

@15
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yeah, I am getting a little cold."
<es>

@16
<en>Haruka sat up and cuddled up to me.
<es>

@17
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ahh, so warm!"
<es>

@18
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't use me as your body warmer."
<es>

@19
<en>{Haruka}\n"Why not? What's wrong with it? You're happy to cuddle up with Haruka-chan, aren't you?"
<es>

@20
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not really."
<es>

@21
<en>I teased her because she could see into my mind.
<es>

@22
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh, is that right? Are you bored with me?"
<es>

@23
<en>Haruka took my joke literally and looked sad.
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey."
<es>

@25
<en>I held her hands and pulled her up.
<es>

@26
<en>{Haruka}\n"I had a dream last night, about a long time ago."
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah? To me, every day is like a dream."
<es>

@28
<en>Haruka and I were now in a foreign country together. We made our dream come true, which is why every day feels like a fantasy.
<es>

@29
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yeah, me too."
<es>

@30
<en>Haruka had never left the island once since she was born. I thought she would be worried after suddenly being brought somewhere so far away, but she was enjoying every day.
<es>

@31
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hey, where are we going next?"
<es>

@32
<en>She asked me with her eyes sparkling.
<es>

@33
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, where do you want to go, Haruka?"
<es>

@34
<en>This is a huge continent. We'll eventually make our way somewhere as long as we keep on driving.
<es>

@35
<en>{Haruka}\n"It doesn't matter where as long as I'm with you."
<es>

@36
<en>I can go anywhere I want too as long as I can see her smile. I feel like we can go to places unseen together.
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shall we go, then?"
<es>

@38
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yes. Let's go!"
<es>

@39
<en>Haruka leapt up and dragged me by the hands. We ran around outside, not knowing where our next destination would be.\nBut it doesn't matter, as long as we're together.
