<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's enough......"
<es>

@10
<en>Just when I decided to help her out, Mizuki looked at me like a hunter about to shoot a deer.
<es>

@11
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......?"
<es>

@12
<en>I have a bad feeling about this.
<es>

@16
<en>{Mizuki}\n"O-oh well. If you're going to be that insistent, I'll have to confess."
<es>

@17
<en>Mizuki spoke in a near monotone as she walked toward me and put her arm around mine.
<es>

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"H-hey?"
<es>

@22
<en>She held me closer. Mizuki was trying to let everyone know that we had a special relationship.
<es>

@25
<en>{Mizuki}\n(Help me out here! Play along!)
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure......?"
<es>

@27
<en>I could feel her breasts against my arm.\nThey're so soft...
<es>

@30
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I wanted to keep this quiet, but you saw how insistent they were. You don't mind, do you?"
<es>

@31
<en>Mizuki was making things up to explain herself away.
<es>

@39
<en>{Sakura}\n"Does that mean you two are already...?"
<es>

@40
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry for keeping it quiet. Yeah, we're already going out."
<es>

@43
<en>Again, in nearly a monotone. Of course, none of it was true. Mizuki only picked me because we made eye contact.
<es>

@44
<en>They say a drowning person will even grab out at leaves. In short, she was drowning at that moment, and I was a piece of straw nearby.
<es>

@48
<en>{Haruka}\n"WHHAAAAAAAAAT?! You and Kazushi-kun?! Since when!?"
<es>

@51
<en>{Mizuki}\n"......since yesterday?"
<es>

@52
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Yesterday?"
<es>

@57
<en>{Rin}\n"Since yesterday? Oh, I see. There are a lot of people who use summer break as their chance to start going out."
<es>

@62
<en>{Ran}\n"Are you guys serious?\nKazushi, I don't recall making an arrangement between you and Mizuki."
<es>

@65
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Why would he need your permission?"
<es>

@70
<en>{Mizuki}\n"...wait. Is there something going on between you two!?"
<es>

@71
<en>Mizuki quickly whispered to me in a panic. I shook my head.
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, there's not."
<es>

@75
<en>{Mizuki}\n"......you scared me.\nIs there someone besides me?"
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nope."
<es>

@79
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So, I'm not causing any problems here, am I? Good."
<es>

@80
<en>I'm glad to see you're relieved, but how about the problems you're causing me?
<es>

@85
<en>{Ran}\n"Are you two really going out? You sure don't look like a couple."
<es>

@88
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes, we are. Right, Kazushi?"
<es>

@89
<en>She yanked my arm. It was her sign for me to agree.
<es>

@90
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yup, we are..."
<es>

@91
<en>Congratulations me! I've got my first girlfriend.
<es>

@92
<en>...Is this really okay?
<es>

@99
<en>{Sakura}\n"Harucchi and Mizuki. I didn't expect that, but well..."
<es>

@103
<en>{Rin}\n"She pretended not to be interested, and then she easily got a guy. Pretty girls have all the luck."
<es>

@106
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm just average.\nYou're the pretty one, Rin. Right, Kazushi?"
<es>

@107
<en>Don't ask me that. How am I supposed to answer in this position?
<es>

@108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think you're much prettier, Mizuki."
<es>

@109
<en>......like that?
<es>

@114
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? I'm pretty?"
<es>

@115
<en>She looked astonished. Come on, why are you acting shocked?
<es>

@116
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Hey, quit dazing out! I'm playing along for your sake!)
<es>

@119
<en>{Mizuki}\n(Oh, yeah......)
<es>

@126
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wh-wh-what are you say? Y-y-you're embarrassing me in front of everyone. Jeez, you're so silly, Kazushi!"
<es>

@127
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahahahaha. Not as silly as you, Mizuki."
<es>

@128
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, no, I'm not as silly as you."
<es>

@129
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahahahaha."
<es>

@130
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahahahaha."
<es>

@131
<en>Are we doing all right fooling them?
<es>

@135
<en>{Haruka}\n"Wow...\nYou guys really are going out."
<es>

@136
<en>Yes, it worked.
<es>

@140
<en>{Ran}\n"They still look suspicious."
<es>

@144
<en>{Rin}\n"Well of course they're a little awkward. They just started going out yesterday. But good for you two."
<es>

@145
<en>This is working out pretty well, but will it be OK later on? We've made it so Mizuki's dating me...
<es>

@150
<en>{Mizuki}\n(Don't worry, they'll forget all about this in a hurry.)
<es>

@151
<en>{Kazushi}\n(They'd better...)
<es>
