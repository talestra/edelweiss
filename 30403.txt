@11
<en>{Yagami}\n"We're truly sorry!"
<es>

@12
<en>Yagami-sensei was apologizing for us.
<es>

@15
<en>{Yagami}\n"Hey! You apologize too!"
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, we're bowing our heads too?"
<es>

@17
<en>{Yagami}\n"Of course!"
<es>

@18
<en>Because of the big commotion, we were caught by Yagami-sensei and dragged into the faculty room.
<es>

@21
<en>{Yagami}\n"We really are sorry."
<es>

@22
<en>Yagami-sensei bowed his head deeply once again. Mei-sensei looked perplexed as Yagami didn't even move with his head bowed.
<es>

@25
<en>{Mei}\n"Yagami-sensei, please look up. This isn't your fault."
<es>

@26
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm in charge of them as their teacher, and it's also part of my job to keep an eye on the alchemy labs."
<es>

@27
<en>{Mei}\n"You have nothing to feel responsible about in this matter, Yagami-sensei."
<es>

@30
<en>Yagami-sensei finally looked up as Mei-sensei comforted him. His expression was still stern.
<es>

@31
<en>{Yagami}\n"No, Kazushi is my student. What Kazushi's done is the same as what I've done. I am taking full responsibility for this!"
<es>

@34
<en>{Mei}\n"Yagami-sensei, please don't. My responsibility is greater than yours."
<es>

@39
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahaha, they're fighting for responsibility. Adults must love taking responsibility."
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't make it sound like it's someone else's problem."
<es>

@44
<en>{Ran}\n"Well..."
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ow?!"
<es>

@52
<en>{Ran}\n"Ngah?!"
<es>

@53
<en>I saw stars shooting out of my eyes and felt a shock like a meteorite through my head. I was afraid that my head was being buried in my body.
<es>

@56
<en>{Ran}\n"Ouch!! What are you doing!?"
<es>

@61
<en>{Yagami}\n"You two should think about what you've done!"
<es>

@62
<en>Yagami-sensei would usually never smack a girl around, but I could tell he was pretty serious.
<es>

@63
<en>Mei-sensei may have been against corporal punishment, but even she didn't say anything this time.
<es>

@66
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmph! I took heavy losses myself, so call it even!"
<es>

@69
<en>{Yagami}\n"Huhh?"
<es>

@70
<en>Oh, shit! Yagami-sensei just went into Hammer Mode!
<es>

@71
<en>{Ran}\n"What?!!"
<es>

@72
<en>Ran victoriously glared right back at Hammer Mode Yagami-sensei.
<es>

@73
<en>Ran was getting defiant now that she was penniless.
<es>

@77
<en>{Mei}\n"Kamoike-san. Please take time to think about what you've done."
<es>

@78
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm not going to think about it at all. Thinking about it would be dwelling on the past! I'm always looking at the future!"
<es>

@79
<en>{Mei}\n"You can't grow as a person if you don't reflect upon your past."
<es>

@82
<en>{Ran}\n"But if I dwell on the past, I'll recall my money and want to die!"
<es>

@83
<en>Ran explained and started to cry on my shoulder.
<es>

@84
<en>I kind of wanted to know how much she'd lost, but I felt too scared to actually ask her.
<es>

@85
<en>Given that I lost a million yen myself, I'd rather disappear from existence than cry.
<es>

@88
<en>{Mei}\n"Sheesh, how did you manage to burn down the entire lab?"
<es>

@89
<en>{Ran}\n"That's what I want to know."
<es>

@90
<en>I didn't know how it happened, either. I couldn't understand much about it.
<es>

@93
<en>{Mei}\n"So, what did you do, and in what order?"
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well..."
<es>

@97
<en>I told her what we'd done, starting from the beginning. I did gloss over a few things, like when we had sex and stuff.
<es>

@100
<en>{Mei}\n"You two..."
<es>

@105
<en>{Yagami}\n"You two sure have guts, having illicit sexual relations on campus."
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? I thought I glossed over that?"
<es>

@111
<en>{Ran}\n"You can't lie, Kazushi. It definitely sounded like we did it in the lab."
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you serious? Oh no..."
<es>

@113
<en>The two teachers couldn't do anything but stare at us.
<es>

@117
<en>{Mei}\n"A man and woman's bodily fluid, huh? That kind of method does exist, but it was too early for you guys to use it."
<es>

@122
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh well. I guess we're just typical teenagers for these days."
<es>

@127
<en>{Yagami}\n"Kazushi, you're paying for this later."
<es>

@128
<en>{Kazushi}\n"R-right."
<es>

@129
<en>I should prepare to spend the rest of summer break in hospital.
<es>

@133
<en>{Ran}\n"But I didn't do anything wrong, right? This isn't my fault."
<es>

@138
<en>{Mei}\n"Nothing will happen when the practitioner is unskilled, even if the steps were right."
<es>

@139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But what was that weird pond?"
<es>

@140
<en>It felt like we had wandered into a different world. What was that all about?
<es>

@143
<en>{Mei}\n"That was a world that reflected your subconscious. Some scholars say that many of the phenomenon that occur through alchemy are a reflection of the alchemist's subconscious."
<es>

@144
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So it was our subconscious mind? That's surreal."
<es>

@147
<en>{Mei}\n"It may be because you two were high at the time. If you knew how to control yourselves a bit better, the results could have been 180 degrees from where they ended up."
<es>

@150
<en>{Ran}\n"What, you mean a completely different result?"
<es>

@153
<en>{Mei}\n"The projection of a mental world is a popular phenomenon caused through alchemical processes. In other words, you could call the experiment a success up to that point."
<es>

@156
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh? Really?"
<es>

@157
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So we were actually doing things right?"
<es>

@158
<en>Mei-sensei nodded. Hey, we were pretty good.
<es>

@161
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Is that so! We were almost there!"
<es>

@164
<en>{Mei}\n"But in your case the problem starts way before that! You guys didn't have permission to use the lab!"
<es>

@167
<en>Ran shrugged her shoulders as Mei-sensei stared at her. She pouted her lips.
<es>

@168
<en>{Ran}\n"But you didn't give me permission."
<es>

@169
<en>{Mei}\n"That's because I thought it would be dangerous for just the two of you. Lo and behold, this happened. Though it went a bit... no, quite beyond my predictions."
<es>

@172
<en>Everybody sighed deeply. We'd blown the lab to smithereens and it was the nucleus for our school.
<es>

@173
<en>I wondered if the reason why they were still nagging us about this is because the teachers didn't even know where to begin punishing us.
<es>

@176
<en>{Yagami}\n"Ibuki-sensei, have you reported this to the principal?"
<es>

@181
<en>{Mei}\n"No, not yet. The principal's off campus today."
<es>

@185
<en>{Ran}\n"That's why we decided to act on it today!"
<es>

@188
<en>{Mei}\n"You're very smart when it comes to breaking the rules. Well, at least that's worked out best for everybody at the moment."
<es>

@192
<en>{Yagami}\n"Maybe we should discuss what we can do before you report to the principal."
<es>

@195
<en>The teachers started whispering to each other.
<es>

@198
<en>{Ran}\n"Umm, I have one concern..."
<es>

@199
<en>Ran spoke timidly.
<es>

@204
<en>{Mei}\n"You only have one concern? I have countless concerns and worries."
<es>

@205
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, you're not going to make me pay for the damages, are you? I don't have any money..."
<es>

@208
<en>{Mei}\n"You don't have to worry about that, but you'd better think about what you've done."
<es>

@209
<en>{Ran}\n"Really, please? I'll think about it as much as you want."
<es>

@210
<en>Ran put her hands together in front of her and begged the teachers.
<es>

@213
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't beg us like that. We'll do our best, but..."
<es>

@217
<en>{Yagami}\n"It all depends on what the principal says."
<es>

@221
<en>*RING! RING!*
<es>

@224
<en>The phone in the staff room rang.\n...no, it was the fax machine.
<es>

@226
<en>*Bzzzz...bzzzzz...*
<es>

@227
<en>The phone stopped ringing, and the fax machine started spitting out papers.
<es>

@230
<en>{Mei}\n"I wonder what it is?"
<es>

@233
<en>Mei-sensei picked up the printout.
<es>

@234
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, it's for you, Kamoike-san."
<es>

@239
<en>{Ran}\n"Me?"
<es>

@240
<en>{Mei}\n"What are they talking about? Freezing assets?"
<es>

@243
<en>{Ran}\n"What!?"
<es>

@247
<en>{Yagami}\n"This one says...\nCancellation of patent contract? What's that mean?"
<es>

@250
<en>{Ran}\n"What? What!? What is this all about!?"
<es>

@254
<en>*RING! RING!*
<es>

@257
<en>This time it was the phone ringing. Ran answered it.
<es>

@260
<en>{Ran}\n"Hello!! What? Mom?"
<es>

@263
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh? Reform fraud? They took your money? Why!!"
<es>

@264
<en>It sounded like every problem that could hit Ran's finances was striking now.
<es>

@265
<en>{Ran}\n"No! How can it be? Now I really am penniless!!"
<es>

@266
<en>All her assets were gone in an instant.
<es>

@269
<en>{Ran}\n"That bitch!! She really took all of my property!!"
<es>

@272
<en>*RING! RING!*
<es>

@273
<en>The phone rang again. Ran was startled, but didn't answer the phone - she was scared of any more bad news.
<es>

@276
<en>Yagami-sensei answered the phone for her.
<es>

@279
<en>{Yagami}\n"Hello, Eiden Academy. ......Oh!! Sempai?!"
<es>

@282
<en>Yagami-sensei snapped to attention. I'd never seen him this nervous or serious.
<es>

@283
<en>{Yagami}\n"Yes! I'm doing fine! Oh, no, I'm sorry it has been too long. Is everything going well for you?"
<es>

@287
<en>{Ran}\n"Must be someone he knows. Yagami-sensei seems really nervous. Who could he be talking to?"
<es>

@288
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know."
<es>

@292
<en>{Yagami}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!"
<es>

@293
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@294
<en>Why was Yagami-sensei calling me to the phone?
<es>

@295
<en>{Yagami}\n"It's for you. It's your father."
<es>

@296
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!?"
<es>

@302
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Owww... my ear's still ringing... That damn old man, yelling his ass off over the phone."
<es>

@303
<en>The phone call was from my dad. Of course, it was about the bike.
<es>

@306
<en>{Ran}\n"Your dad knows Yagami-sensei?"
<es>

@307
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Apparently they went to school together and Yagami-sensei was my dad's kohai."
<es>

@308
<en>Actually, that's all I know about them. I've never found out why Yagami-sensei was so afraid of my dad.
<es>

@311
<en>{Ran}\n"What did your dad say? Was he angry?"
<es>

@312
<en>Ran seemed worried about me. I'm sure she could hear him yelling over the phone.
<es>

@313
<en>{Kazushi}\n"He was furious. Well, I knew he would be, but there's a more serious problem."
<es>

@314
<en>{Ran}\n"What?"
<es>

@315
<en>{Kazushi}\n"He told me to come home if all I'm doing is making trouble."
<es>

@316
<en>{Ran}\n"What? To take a break?"
<es>

@317
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. To quit school."
<es>

@320
<en>{Ran}\n"What!? No way!?"
<es>

@321
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really."
<es>

@322
<en>I was ready to get beaten to a pulp, but I didn't expect him to tell me to quit school.
<es>

@325
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh my god. You're not actually going to quit, are you?"
<es>

@326
<en>She asked me timidly. But, I couldn't give her an answer.
<es>

@327
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't want to, but if he wants me to quit school for real, he'll come and take me home by force."
<es>

@330
<en>{Ran}\n"No way..."
<es>

@331
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes way."
<es>

@332
<en>I'm willing to fight against him, but if my dad gets serious, I'm not sure how long I can hold out against him.
<es>

@333
<en>Ran looked down like a wilted flower and stared at her shoes.
<es>

@336
<en>{Ran}\n"I can't take that. I lost all of my money, and now I'm losing you. What am I going to do?"
<es>

@337
<en>I'd never seen Ran so depressed. It moved me to see her like that.
<es>

@338
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't be sad. It's not like I won't be able to see you for the rest of my life. I'll fight him for that."
<es>

@339
<en>Ran still looked sad despite my encouragement. Then she tightened her lips with determination.
<es>

@342
<en>{Ran}\n"Three days... No, give me two days! I'll find us a way out of this!"
<es>

@343
<en>She sounded confident.
<es>

@344
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you going to do?"
<es>

@345
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't know! But, don't worry, I have a plan!"
<es>

@349
<en>Ran started to run as she said that.
<es>

@351
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!? What's your plan!?"
<es>

@352
<en>Ran disappeared before my words could reach her.
<es>

@353
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's gone..."
<es>

@354
<en>What was she going to do?\n...I hope it's not something stupid.
<es>

@358
<en>Then Ran really disappeared for two days.
<es>

@361
<en>Two days later...
<es>

@365
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!"
<es>

@369
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fugah?!"
<es>

@370
<en>I heard someone calling my name and felt a shock as I was laying down.
<es>

@374
<en>{Ran}\n"What do you mean, 'Fugah?!' Quit sleeping and wake up!"
<es>

@375
<en>I found Ran sitting on my stomach. She must have jumped on me.
<es>

@376
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm up, I'm up...\nJeez, don't jump on people like that. You're not a kid anymore, you know?"
<es>

@379
<en>{Ran}\n"No time for that. I found a way to make a fortune in one fell swoop!"
<es>

@380
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A fortune?"
<es>

@381
<en>Uh oh. This sounds bad - very bad. My spider sense is tingling at how bad this is going to be.
<es>

@382
<en>I really don't want to hear this, but I don't think I have a choice.
<es>

@387
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You shouldn't commit any crimes. Don't go stealing anything."
<es>

@388
<en>Of course her plan involved theft. There was a rumor that our school had a treasure buried somewhere on campus. She wanted to find the treasure and claim it for us.
<es>

@391
<en>{Ran}\n"It's not theft. Gold made by alchemy doesn't belong to anyone, right?"
<es>

@392
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Isn't it the alchemist's?"
<es>

@395
<en>{Ran}\n"If you say that then the gold in mines and the dust in rivers belong to nature. It all belongs to the Earth! Hooray for the Earth!!"
<es>

@396
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Calm down."
<es>

@399
<en>{Ran}\n"Does a 10,000 yen bill belong to the mint? No, it doesn't! So it's OK for us to take it!"
<es>

@400
<en>I beg to disagree - I absolutely think it's theft to steal a 10,000 yen bill from the mint.
<es>

@401
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You'd better calm down and think this over. They say 'You may be wearing rags, but your heart wears brocade', you know?"
<es>

@404
<en>{Ran}\n"Your heart wears brocade? I don't understand. I don't mind the ragged cloth, but I need money!"
<es>

@405
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're pretty blunt."
<es>

@408
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, why are you talking like this isn't your problem? You might have to quit school if we don't do something about this!"
<es>

@409
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...you're right."
<es>

@410
<en>My dad hadn't called me since. It was weird, especially since I didn't think he'd let it go like this. Dad tends to get very stubborn...
<es>

@413
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, don't worry. I called him. We still have some time."
<es>

@414
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Who did you call?"
<es>

@417
<en>{Ran}\n"Your dad. I told him that we'll get his bike back, but we'll need some time."
<es>

@418
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? You? Called my house? Did you talk to my dad?"
<es>

@421
<en>{Ran}\n"He's very understanding... for your dad. I asked and he said he'll wait."
<es>

@422
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What else did you talk about?"
<es>

@425
<en>{Ran}\n"He wanted to know who I was, so I made a few things up, you know?"
<es>

@426
<en>What kind of things? I'm scared to ask her.
<es>

@427
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What did he say?"
<es>

@428
<en>I asked her timidly.
<es>

@431
<en>{Ran}\n"He said 'I'm going to kill him' like he really meant it, and your sister said that she needed to have a few words with you as well."
<es>

@432
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see..."
<es>

@433
<en>I can never go home again.
<es>

@436
<en>{Ran}\n"So don't worry. I'll save you, Kazushi. I won't let you quit school."
<es>

@439
<en>Ran held me softly. The hug felt like it was from a goddess, but what she was saying and doing were so different that it didn't move me emotionally.
<es>

@440
<en>{Ran}\n"Let's be happy together. Then we can have lots of sex."
<es>

@441
<en>{Kazushi}\n"S-sex?"
<es>

@444
<en>{Ran}\n"See? You're getting hard. If everything goes well tonight then we can have fun all day tomorrow."
<es>

@445
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Y-yeah! Let's! Let's!"
<es>

@446
<en>Wait a minute... Why am I getting so excited? Maybe I should be having second thoughts...
<es>

@449
<en>{Kazushi}\n"..."
<es>

@450
<en>I'd been here at night a few times before, but it sure did get spooky in the dark. Maybe because of the European architecture...
<es>

@451
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure about the treasure? You'd better have some solid info..."
<es>

@452
<en>Ran seemed strangely reliable tonight. She turned around and gave me a smile.
<es>

@455
<en>{Ran}\n"The principal's husband was an alchemist. And he's the one who taught her alchemy."
<es>

@456
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The principal married her teacher? What a tantalizing relationship."
<es>

@457
<en>A student and a teacher sounds like a forbidden relationship.
<es>

@458
<en>{Ran}\n"Really? I thought it was common?"
<es>

@459
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not really. It would be like me and Mei-sensei... you know?"
<es>

@462
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahaha! That is SO not happening!"
<es>

@463
<en>She was easily convinced. I guess it wasn't happening, but I had mixed feelings about that...
<es>

@466
<en>{Ran}\n"Anyway, the principal established the academy so her husband could work on alchemy. It was an alchemic gift."
<es>

@467
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A gift? That seems like way too much to be a mere gift."
<es>

@468
<en>I looked around the dark room. How much time and money did it take to create something like this? And then to give it away like that?
<es>

@469
<en>I've heard of rich businessmen buying condos for their mistresses, but this was like buying her a whole apartment building.

<en>{Ran}\n"Well, the president's loaded. They say that the entire island belongs to the Aozora family, so she must be wealthy."
<es>

@471
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She must be! How can you be that rich?"
<es>

@474
<en>{Ran}\n"How did the Aozora family end up with that much wealth? It is hard to say. The family has a long history, but they haven't had any job in particular."
<es>

@475
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You investigated that much?"
<es>

@476
<en>What kind of sources did she have? It bordered on the obsessive.
<es>

@477
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So what you're saying is that the Aozora family established their wealth using alchemy?"
<es>

@480
<en>{Ran}\n"You got it. It's kind of like having your own personal mint inside the house. You can make all the money you ever wished for."
<es>

@481
<en>{Ran}\n"In that case, nobody will mind if we take a little bit, don't you think?"
<es>

@482
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know about that."
<es>

@483
<en>I still think stealing is a no-no, but knowing that they can create more to replace it lifted some of the guilt off of my shoulders.
<es>

@484
<en>...no it didn't.\nRan's way of thinking was starting to poison me. I had to watch out and make sure she didn't go too far.
<es>

@487
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't know if there's really a treasure here, but there's definitely SOMETHING underground for sure."
<es>

@488
<en>She kicked the floor with her toes.
<es>

@489
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is there a secret underground lair on this campus? I've never heard of that."
<es>

@492
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes, there is. No one knows about it, but it's on the blueprints."
<es>

@493
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You examined the blueprints?"
<es>

@494
<en>I was impressed, rather than shocked. Couldn't she use this kind of energy for something positive?
<es>

@495
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't know what kind of treasure lies ahead, but it's got to be massive. It'll be enough to cover my losses and your million yen and still have something left over."
<es>

@496
<en>Ran was so excited by our school's treasure.
<es>

@497
<en>{Ran}\n"You better be ready, Kazushi! We are gonna be RICH by tomorrow morning!"
<es>

@498
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I just hope everything goes as planned..."
<es>

@501
<en>{Ran}\n"What're you talking about? I'll make it go as planned. Don't you worry about that!"
<es>

@504
<en>{Ran}\n"Let's go!"
<es>

@506
<en>Ran started to walk bravely. I had no idea what lay up ahead.
<es>

@511
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow..."
<es>

@512
<en>I couldn't believe there was a space like this under the academy.
<es>

@513
<en>{Ran}\n"See? I told you so. Don't you think they've got to be hiding something down here?"
<es>

@514
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. There might be some ghosts down here too..."
<es>

@515
<en>I felt warm, humid air blowing on us. Where's it coming from? Spooky...
<es>

@516
<en>{Ran}\n"Never mind about the ghosts. Look for treasure. Treasure."
<es>

@517
<en>Ran seemed so excited that she was almost skipping along the path.
<es>

@518
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey! Don't go too far. It's dangerous to walk alone!"
<es>

@519
<en>{Ran}\n"It's OK. I can handle it..."
<es>

@521
<en>............
<es>

@522
<en>.........
<es>

@523
<en>What? Ran disappeared.
<es>

@524
<en>{Ran}\n"K-Kazushiiiiiiii!!"
<es>

@525
<en>I heard a pathetic voice coming from below.
<es>

@526
<en>{Kazushi}\n"H-hey, Ran!?"
<es>

@527
<en>{Ran}\n"Help me!!"
<es>

@528
<en>I heard her voice reverberating against the floor. Sure enough, Ran was hanging onto the edge of a big hole.
<es>

@529
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm falling!"
<es>

@530
<en>She was barely hanging onto the edge.
<es>

@531
<en>{Kazushi}\n"H-hold on! I'll pull you up!!"
<es>

@532
<en>{Ran}\n"Please hurry!"
<es>

@537
<en>{Ran}\n"What's with this hole!?"
<es>

@538
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, it seems like a trap."
<es>

@540
<en>We looked into the hole. There was a huge forest of spears and the bleached bones of some corpse...
<es>

@543
<en>{Ran}\n"Is that an animal?"
<es>

@544
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mmm...maybe a dog or a cat? Though it's big enough that it could even be a small bear..."
<es>

@547
<en>{Ran}\n"It's shaped kinda like a monkey. Ahahahahaha..."
<es>

@548
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ha ha..."
<es>

@551
<en>{Ran}\n"..."
<es>

@552
<en>Is it OK to keep going like this? What kind of traps are we going to encounter?
<es>

@555
<en>{Ran}\n"A-are you scared? Don't you want money? Which is more important to you, money or your life!?"
<es>

@556
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're more important to me, Ran."
<es>

@557
<en>{Ran}\n"You're such a wuss! How do you expect to get by in this dog eat dog world?"
<es>

@560
<en>{Ran}\n"Wait? What did you say? Did you say I'm more important?"
<es>

@561
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We don't need the money. We should go back if you're going to be in danger like that again."
<es>

@564
<en>{Ran}\n"O-oh, your lip service is good! How much are you trying to swindle out of me!?"
<es>

@565
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I'm not trying to take anything..."
<es>

@568
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, 500 yen, no, maybe I can pay one thousand yen for that. Oh, I remembered! I'm penniless!!"
<es>

@570
<en>She looked into her purse and was depressed all over again. But was she really going to pay me for that?
<es>

@573
<en>{Ran}\n"Argh, I hate this! It's such a pain to not have any money at all! I really need this treasure!"
<es>

@576
<en>{Ran}\n"OK. Let's go, Kazushi!"
<es>

@578
<en>Ran became even more excited, took my hand, and started to walk.
<es>

@579
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm telling you, it's too dangerous."
<es>

@582
<en>{Ran}\n"Then it'll be your job to protect me. Now come on! Hurry up!"
<es>

@583
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok, Ok."
<es>

@584
<en>She wasn't listening to me. I'd just have to protect her if something happens, just like she said.
<es>

@588
<en>*Step step step*
<es>

@589
<en>How long have we been walking for?\nI could hear our footsteps repeating over and over.
<es>

@592
<en>{Ran}\n"How far does this tunnel lead?"
<es>

@593
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are we lost? It seems like we're going round in circles."
<es>

@594
<en>{Ran}\n"Are you sure? Well, we can't reach anywhere like this. It's strange."
<es>

@597
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you want to go back?"
<es>

@600
<en>{Ran}\n"Well... Let me try something before that."
<es>

@601
<en>Ran stopped and started running her hands against the wall.
<es>

@602
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What're you looking for?"
<es>

@605
<en>{Ran}\n"It's common to find a hidden door or a hidden switch. Let me give it a try."
<es>

@606
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's only in the movies..."
<es>

@608
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@609
<en>Ran's hand slid into the wall up to her wrist.
<es>

@613
<en>{Ran}\n"I-I pushed something!"
<es>

@614
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What kind of switch was it!?"
<es>

@615
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't know..."
<es>

@618
<en>Rrrrrrumble...
<es>

@619
<en>It sounded like the ground was shaking.
<es>

@622
<en>{Ran}\n"Maybe I know what it is."
<es>

@624
<en>Ran pulled her hand out of the wall and grabbed my arm.
<es>

@625
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Me too."
<es>

@626
<en>This sound...
<es>

@627
<en>It was coming from the way we came in. We felt a cool breeze blowing on us from the darkness.
<es>

@633
<en>{Ran}\n"Here it comes!!"
<es>

@638
<en>We saw a wave coming towards us after the breeze as we expected. Waves of water were torrenting towards us through the corridor.
<es>

@639
<en>{Kazushi}\n"R-run!!"
<es>

@642
<en>{Ran}\n"OK!!"
<es>

@644
<en>I took her hand and started to run.
<es>

@646
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah!!"
<es>

@649
<en>Her hand was pulled out of mine by a strong force.
<es>

@650
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@651
<en>I stopped to look back. Ran hit the ground face down. I saw a tidal wave gushing so close to her..."
<es>

@655
<en>{Ran}\n"Ouch... I hit my face..."
<es>

@656
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@658
<en>I threw myself on top of her to cover her from the impact. Next thing I knew, the rushing water slammed into us and we disappeared beneath the wave.
<es>

@665
<en>*drip drip*
<es>

@666
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@667
<en>I woke up to the sound of steadily dripping water.
<es>

@668
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where am I?"
<es>

@669
<en>I couldn't see anything because it was so dark.
<es>

@670
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@671
<en>I looked for Ran in the darkness, but I remembered that she was in my arms the whole time.
<es>

@672
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Phew... Thank god."
<es>

@673
<en>I guess I didn't let go of Ran as the flood washed over us.
<es>

@674
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran! Ran!"
<es>

@675
<en>{Ran}\n"..."
<es>

@676
<en>She was unconscious, but her breathing was fine. I couldn't tell if she was just asleep or worse, but I could hear the rhythm of her breathing.
<es>

@677
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess we weren't in the water too long..."
<es>

@678
<en>I felt relieved that we were both fine. Then my anxiety returned.\nWhere are we?
<es>

@679
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran! Hey, wake up."
<es>

@681
<en>*Slap slap*
<es>

@682
<en>I slapped her cheek.
<es>

@683
<en>{Ran}\n"Mm... Five more yen..."
<es>

@684
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wrong unit. You're thinking of minutes."
<es>

@685
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@686
<en>Ran opened her eyes, but we couldn't see anything because of the darkness.
<es>

@687
<en>{Ran}\n"What? I can't see anything?"
<es>

@688
<en>I guess she woke up. She was surprised to wake up to the darkness as well.
<es>

@689
<en>{Ran}\n"Is that you, Kazushi? Is it you?"
<es>

@690
<en>She was touching my face.
<es>

@691
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, it's me. Are you Ran?"
<es>

@692
<en>I grabbed her tits. On purpose, of course.
<es>

@693
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah!\nHey, don't touch those!"
<es>

@695
<en>*SLAP!*
<es>

@696
<en>She slapped my hand away.
<es>

@697
<en>{Ran}\n"Just because we're penniless doesn't mean you can sneak a feel."
<es>

@698
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that what the problem is?"
<es>

@699
<en>{Ran}\n"I'll make you pay for this when we find the treasure. We should do something we haven't done before for an additional charge as well!"
<es>

@700
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What could that be? I don't even know what it is, but are you sure?"
<es>

@701
<en>I began fantasizing.
<es>

@702
<en>{Ran}\n"Sure, if you can pay for it."
<es>

@703
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow! So it all comes down to money!"
<es>

@704
<en>{Ran}\n"Of course! You can do anything with money."
<es>

@705
<en>I could do anything I wanted if I found the treasure and made it back alive. My dreams lit the darkness in a rainbow of colors.
<es>

@706
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But we can't do anything in this darkness. We need some light."
<es>

@707
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, did you bring a lighter?"
<es>

@708
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, but I've got a match. I tried to snag a lighter from the cafeteria, but I got caught and they gave me a match instead."
<es>

@709
<en>Good thing I put it in a plastic bag so it wouldn't get wet.
<es>

@710
<en>{Ran}\n"A match? Who uses a match these days? It'll go out in a second."
<es>

@711
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We need something to burn. Is there anything around here?"
<es>

@713
<en>*Rustle*
<es>

@714
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@715
<en>I reached out and felt some dry paper with my fingertip. Is this a rubbish bin? I felt more paper in neat stacks.
<es>

@716
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok, we should burn this."
<es>

@717
<en>{Ran}\n"Hurry, hurry."
<es>

@719
<en>I struck the match. A small flame lit up the room, but it was too small and we couldn't see very far.
<es>

@720
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Give me some distance."
<es>

@722
<en>I picked up more litter and started burning it as well. The flame grew larger and started to light the room.
<es>

@723
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow, we can see!"
<es>

@731
<en>The flame grew bigger before we knew it and lit up the room.
<es>

@734
<en>{Ran}\n"Good thing we found some rub-..."
<es>

@737
<en>Ran suddenly fell silent.
<es>

@738
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, what are you burning?"
<es>

@739
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? It's just some ru - Gyah!"
<es>

@740
<en>I'm caught by surprise again. I thought it was some litter, but it was a wad of bills - 10,000 yen bills!
<es>

@743
<en>{Ran}\n"That's a 10,000 yen bill if I'm not mistaken!"
<es>

@744
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What the--? What's going on? What's all this money doing here?"
<es>

@745
<en>I could only laugh at this point. All this money was catching on fire and burning well.
<es>

@746
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahahahahahaha."
<es>

@747
<en>{Ran}\n"...!!"
<es>

@748
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hhhhh?!"
<es>

@749
<en>The devil! The devil is here! Am in hell?!
<es>

@750
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I couldn't see at all in the dark! It's not my fault! Ran, you didn't notice it either!"
<es>

@753
<en>{Ran}\n"No, no!! We're burning money!! No!!"
<es>

@754
<en>She regressed mentally for a moment. Ran started bawling and threw a tantrum on the ground like a kid being told no in a toy store.
<es>

@755
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran! We need to think positive! If there's all this money scattered over here, we should be able to find some more over there!"
<es>

@758
<en>{Ran}\n"Really?"
<es>

@759
<en>Ran looked up with tears in her eyes. Her face looked like the devil incarnate a moment ago, but now resembled a small innocent child.
<es>

@760
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah! The fortune you were talking about shouldn't be this little, right?"
<es>

@761
<en>{Ran}\n"... Yeah, I guess so."
<es>

@762
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well then, this is just the start of it. There must be more treasure somewhere else."
<es>

@765
<en>{Ran}\n"You think? ...You're right."
<es>

@766
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure, there must be! Believe me!"
<es>

@769
<en>{Ran}\n"Ok! I believe you! There must be more! We must find it!"
<es>

@773
<en>Ran found a piece of wood and put it to the flame, making an instant torch.
<es>

@774
<en>{Ran}\n"Alright! Treasure, here we come!"
<es>

@776
<en>She stepped forward, but stopped suddenly. Ran raised the torched and peered into something. It appeared to be a dead-end.
<es>

@779
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi... Kazushi!"
<es>

@780
<en>She reached her hand back to me while looking forward.
<es>

@781
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@782
<en>The torch shined on her face and it looked as pale as paper.\nI wonder what she's looking at...
<es>

@783
<en>{Ran}\n"What do you think that is?"
<es>

@784
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@786
<en>They were all lined up along the wall, flickering in the light of the torch.
<es>

@790
<en>There was a shelf along the wall with a series of glass jars on it. It looked like lab specimens.
<es>

@791
<en>Inside the jars were corpses of small animals, organs from something... just what you'd expect from a biology lab, but in frightening supply.
<es>

@792
<en>{Ran}\n"What is this? This is gross."
<es>

@793
<en>Ran hid behind my back. She didn't usually get emotional, but this was too creepy for her.
<es>

@794
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What happened here?"
<es>

@795
<en>I've seen something like this before. It was when we went to visit the graveyard at our local temple.
<es>

@796
<en>There had been countless Buddhist statues for the dead with no one to pay their respects.
<es>

@797
<en>The glass jars lined up like that made me recall that memory.
<es>

@800
<en>{Ran}\n"This is a dead end, right? So, where's the treasure?"
<es>

@801
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This can't be the treasure..."
<es>

@804
<en>{Ran}\n"Stop it. This can't be treasure. Or do you think I could sell it at a premium to some maniac?"
<es>

@805
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't get worked up over that. I don't like the idea that anything's alright so long as you profit..."
<es>

@808
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm joking. Jeez, you sound like someone's mother-in-law."
<es>

@809
<en>Because it sounds serious when she says it.
<es>

@810
<en>{Ran}\n"I really hope the treasure isn't the money burning over there."
<es>

@811
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this an alchemy lab or something? If so, maybe we can find something made with alchemy hidden here."
<es>

@814
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah, you're right. We shouldn't be that far off the mark, right?"
<es>

@815
<en>We stuck together and looked around.
<es>

@816
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@817
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it this time?"
<es>

@818
<en>Ran was peering into a hole in the rocky wall.
<es>

@821
<en>{Ran}\n"See? There's something written in there."
<es>

@822
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@824
<en>We lit up the wall with a torch. I could see something written up there.
<es>

@825
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I l o v e y o u...?"
<es>

@826
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's that supposed to mean?"
<es>

@829
<en>{Ran}\n"I love you, right?"
<es>

@830
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah. It sure does."
<es>

@833
<en>{Ran}\n"Hold on. There's more underneath."
<es>

@834
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Hi...sa...it's blurry, I can't see it all."
<es>

@835
<en>{Ran}\n"Isn't it a name?"
<es>

@836
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So it's a message to someone."
<es>

@837
<en>I love you...
<es>

@838
<en>The message doesn't match the environment at all. I wonder who left it here.
<es>

@841
<en>{Ran}\n"But, it doesn't look like there are any treasures..."

@842
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah..."
<es>

@844
<en>We kept wandering around and lighting things up with the torch. We didn't see anything worthy, but then we found it.
<es>

@852
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow! A treasure chest!"
<es>

@853
<en>It looked like a treasure chest out of a pirate novel. It looked so unreal because it was an exact mirror of the stereotypical image.
<es>

@856
<en>{Ran}\n"What is it? What do you think's in there?"
<es>

@857
<en>Ran started opening the box without thinking.
<es>

@858
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait! We'd better take it slow--"
<es>

@861
<en>{Ran}\n"Ei!"
<es>

@862
<en>I was too late. Ran opened the box already.
<es>

@867
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!?"
<es>

@868
<en>At that moment, light so strong I thought it would melt everything came shining out of the box.
<es>

@869
<en>{Ran}\n"What is this!?"
<es>

@870
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran, this way..."
<es>

@871
<en>I felt something weird and tried to grab Ran, but the light was too bright! I couldn't see anything!
<es>

@872
<en>I reached out for Ran who should be standing next to me, but I couldn't reach her.
<es>

@873
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@874
<en>I heard her voice. But I couldn't reach her.
<es>

@879
<en>When I was able to see at last, I found myself at the bottom of the water again. And I saw that girl on top of the water.
<es>

@883
<en>{Ran}\n"You again!"
<es>

@890
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Is the item you dropped this Golden Kazushi? Or this Silver Kazushi?"
<es>

@891
<en>She trapped me at the bottom of the lake again.
<es>

@897
<en>{Ran}\n"Hahan! I'm on to your tricks now! Give me back the real Kazushi!!"
<es>

@898
<en>Wow, she chose me! She did learn from the past!
<es>

@902
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Then this gold Kazushi and this 300,000,000 yen? Which one did you drop?"
<es>

@906
<en>{Ran}\n"What!? 300,000,000 yen?"
<es>

@907
<en>She was responding to that!\nA Golden Kazushi and 300,000,000 yen? Where am I in this equation?
<es>

@910
<en>{Ran}\n"300,000,000 yen... I wonder how much the gold Kazushi would go for in cash. What's the commodities rate for gold right now?"
<es>

@911
<en>She's doing the math? And she's comparing the Golden Kazushi with the money?
<es>

@912
<en>How about me?
<es>

@915
<en>{Ran}\n"...Ah!"
<es>

@916
<en>Yes, she came back!
<es>

@917
<en>{Ran}\n"J-just kidding! I won't make the same mistake twice!"
<es>

@918
<en>It was shaky, but she did it. I'm proud of my girlfriend!!
<es>

@921
<en>{Ran}\n"You can't fool me! Where's Kazushi? I want Kazushi back!!"
<es>

@922
<en>She yelled and picked up a rock by her feet.
<es>

@923
<en>{Ran}\n"I want Kazushi back!!"
<es>

@925
<en>She threw the rock as hard as she could. The rock flew straight at the Fairy of the Spring, hitting her in the face.
<es>

@932
<en>{Ran}\n"Kyah?!"
<es>

@933
<en>The light exploded like a bomb.
<es>

@934
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@935
<en>The light disappeared like it was sucked into something.
<es>

@945
<en>{Ran}\n"What?"
<es>

@946
<en>Ran found herself in an underground room. The Fairy of the Spring was gone. The bonfire we made was still burning and shining in the corner.
<es>

@947
<en>Ran was standing there alone.
<es>

@950
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh? Kazushi? Where are you?"
<es>

@951
<en>She looked around and noticed it. The treasure chest was still there.
<es>

@952
<en>{Ran}\n"Again..."
<es>

@953
<en>She walked toward it cautiously, but the lid was already open and some light was coming out of it.
<es>

@954
<en>{Ran}\n"What is this?"
<es>

@955
<en>She opened it.
<es>

@958
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow, too bright!"
<es>

@959
<en>She found a mountain of treasure inside. There were enough gemstones and gold to make one gasp and become dizzy.
<es>

@960
<en>{Ran}\n"Why? Oh! Is this because I made a honest answer?"
<es>

@962
<en>I honestly told her that I hadn't left the gold or silver Kazushi behind.\nThat's right. The honest person gets rewarded in the stories.
<es>

@964
<en>{Ran}\n"But this isn't right! Where's Kazushi? Kazushi??"
<es>

@965
<en>The treasure didn't please her now. She couldn't find Kazushi, and that was making her worry.
<es>

@966
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Where are you? Kazushi!"
<es>

@967
<en>She walked around. She was on the verge of breaking into tears as she wandered around the room, looking like a lost child.
<es>

@968
<en>{Ran}\n"No, he's gone! Where's Kazushi!? Don't leave me here alone!"
<es>

@969
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!! Hey, Kazushi!!"
<es>

@970
<en>But no matter how much she called, he didn't respond. In his place remained the treasure chest.
<es>

@971
<en>{Ran}\n"Such crap..."
<es>

@972
<en>How much would this be in cash? But even that didn't make Ran happy.
<es>

@973
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! I found the treasure! Look! You've never seen so much treasure before! Kazushi, look at this!"
<es>

@974
<en>The person she wanted to show it to wasn't there. The person she wanted to share this happiness with wasn't there.
<es>

@975
<en>{Ran}\n"What crap..."
<es>

@976
<en>She thrust her hand into the treasure chest. She grabbed the coins and jewels like they were garbage and started emptying the box.
<es>

@977
<en>{Ran}\n"Crap! Crap!"
<es>

@978
<en>She scooped a massive diamond and full gold bar out and threw them away, along with everything else in the box.
<es>

@979
<en>{Ran}\n"I'll give it all back, so give Kazushi back to me!"
<es>

@980
<en>She emptied the entire chest and scattered the contents everywhere until she shook the empty chest up and down.
<es>

@981
<en>{Ran}\n"I want Kazushi back..."
<es>

@982
<en>Nothing happened. She threw the empty chest away and sat feebly on the ground.
<es>

@983
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi... *sniff*... wah, wah..."
<es>

@984
<en>Then she started to cry.
<es>

@989
<en>Wahh, wahh...
<es>

@990
<en>Someone was crying?
<es>

@991
<en>Wahh, wahh...
<es>

@992
<en>Who?
<es>

@993
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@994
<en>{Kazushi}\n"H-huh?"
<es>

@995
<en>What's this?\nI could see something shining in the dark. It was round and copper colored.
<es>

@997
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A ten yen coin?"
<es>

@998
<en>Wahh, wahh...
<es>

@999
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran?"
<es>

@1000
<en>Is that Ran crying? Yes, it is. Where is she?
<es>

@1001
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@1005
<en>What?
<es>

@1006
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I-it's her!!"
<es>

@1007
<en>That bitch again!! She'd taken everything from Ran, but it still wasn't enough?\nIs she trying to take even more money from me?
<es>

@1008
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well too bad for you! I don't have any. You even took my million yen away from me."
<es>

@1009
<en>I felt my pocket and felt the cold coin on my fingertips.
<es>

@1010
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See!? This coin is all I've got!"
<es>

@1012
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"..."
<es>

@1013
<en>But she was still staring at me.
<es>

@1014
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@1015
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"...Kazushi."
<es>

@1016
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Don't talk to me like that."
<es>

@1017
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Kazu...shi...Kazushi..."
<es>

@1018
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you... huh?"
<es>

@1019
<en>Something's not right. Her face looked like she was about to cry, like a lost child.
<es>

@1020
<en>That face reminded me of someone.
<es>

@1021
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran?"
<es>

@1022
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@1023
<en>She called my name. It was Ran. Ran was overlapping with the Fairy of the Spring.
<es>

@1024
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Kazushi... money..."
<es>

@1025
<en>She still wasn't satisfied after taking all that money? She probably never would be.
<es>

@1026
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let it go."
<es>

@1027
<en>I clenched onto the coin in my pocket. It's the coin that saved her when she was lost as a child.
<es>

@1028
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is what you wanted to find!"
<es>

@1029
<en>I threw the coin into the spring and it disappeared in the water.
<es>

@1032
<en>The spring flashed a bright light at that moment.
<es>

@1033
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!!?"
<es>

@1036
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's gone..."
<es>

@1037
<en>The lights disappeared and I found myself in a dark space. Where did the spring and the fairy go?
<es>

@1038
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@1039
<en>I found a small treasure chest at my feet and opened it up.
<es>

@1040
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is..."
<es>

@1041
<en>A bank book? It said "Kamoike Ran" on the front - and there were a lot of them.
<es>

@1042
<en>They were all in Ran's name. I opened one of them and my jaw hit the floor in shock.
<es>

@1043
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow... she's loaded."
<es>

@1044
<en>The numbers made me want to marry her. But why were her bank books here? I thought she was penniless...
<es>

@1045
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, is this the money the fairy took from Ran?"
<es>

@1046
<en>Had the fairy given it back to her? I wasn't sure if this is all her money, but I was sure Ran would be happy about it.
<es>

@1047
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah. I have to find Ran."
<es>

@1048
<en>I started to run.
<es>

@1051
<en>At that moment, I felt a hard shake and I hit the ground.
<es>

@1052
<en>{Kazushi}\n"An earthquake?"
<es>

@1053
<en>{Ran}\n"Fuck you! Asshole!!!"
<es>

@1054
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Ran?"
<es>

@1055
<en>It was Ran's voice.
<es>

@1063
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!"
<es>

@1064
<en>Ran went around breaking everything she saw as she called his name.
<es>

@1065
<en>It felt like a hurricane hitting because of that.
<es>

@1066
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey!!"
<es>

@1069
<en>Ran stopped and listened to his voice.
<es>

@1070
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi? Kazushi?!"
<es>

@1071
<en>She looked around, but no one was there.
<es>

@1074
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!? Where are you?"
<es>

@1075
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Here! Right here!"
<es>

@1076
<en>She looked around, trying to find where the voice was coming from, and located it.
<es>

@1077
<en>{Ran}\n"In the chest?"
<es>

@1078
<en>Under the upside-down treasure chest. That's where his voice was coming from.
<es>

@1079
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@1080
<en>Ran jumped onto the chest. She flipped it over and looked inside.
<es>

@1083
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@1084
<en>Kazushi was inside.
<es>

@1085
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@1086
<en>He was in the chest, but not crammed into the chest. Kazushi was in a dark, square room.
<es>

@1087
<en>The reduced perspective was wrong. Kazushi looked so small and far away in the chest.
<es>

@1088
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@1094
<en>I heard her voice. It was Ran, and her voice was coming from above.
<es>

@1095
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@1096
<en>I looked up and was surprised. The ceiling was dark, but now Ran was looking into the room from above.
<es>

@1097
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@1098
<en>Ran was calling me, but the scale was off. It's like a giant was looking into my room.
<es>

@1099
<en>But it was definitely Ran up there.
<es>

@1100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@1101
<en>I reached my hand above my head. Ran should be able to pull me out.
<es>

@1102
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, hold on!"
<es>

@1103
<en>Ran figured out what I was trying to do. She was hesitant, but reached out her hand towards me.
<es>

@1104
<en>{Ran}\n"Grab on!!"
<es>

@1105
<en>Ran's hand came close. The strange thing was, she may have looked like a giant before, but now her hands were the same size as mine.
<es>

@1106
<en>{Ran}\n"Hurry!"
<es>

@1107
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK!"
<es>

@1108
<en>I grabbed her hand. It made me relaxed, feeling that familiar warmth.
<es>

@1109
<en>{Ran}\n"I'll pull you up!"
<es>

@1110
<en>She grabbed on tightly to my hand and pulled as hard as she could. I felt my body lifting up.
<es>

@1111
<en>{Ran}\n"Kaaazuuuushiii! Hyaaaaaaaahhh!!"
<es>

@1112
<en>My body rose up towards the bright ceiling.
<es>

@1113
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oooooooh!"
<es>

@1114
<en>Then I was pulled out of the square ceiling to the outside world.
<es>

@1123
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@1125
<en>Ran caught my body as I popped out, but I was too heavy and we both hit the ground.
<es>

@1128
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!"
<es>

@1129
<en>Ran held me tightly as we lay on the ground.
<es>

@1130
<en>It was almost too tight, but it made me feel relaxed.
<es>

@1131
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm saved. Thanks."
<es>

@1132
<en>She made me surprised as I looked up and saw her face.
<es>

@1133
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you crying?"
<es>

@1136
<en>{Ran}\n"What?"
<es>

@1137
<en>Ran looked surprised. Her face was covered with tears.
<es>

@1138
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm not crying...huh?"
<es>

@1139
<en>She touched her face and became surprised. She looked at her wet fingertips with confusion.
<es>

@1140
<en>{Ran}\n"No? It can't be."
<es>

@1141
<en>Her tears were gushing out one after another. It was beautiful. I thought her tears were more beautiful than any gemstone.
<es>

@1142
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't cry. I'm fine now."
<es>

@1143
<en>It was my turn to hold Ran.
<es>

@1144
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm fine now."
<es>

@1147
<en>{Ran}\n"Ok... Ok!"
<es>

@1148
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Look. This is yours, right?"
<es>

@1149
<en>I opened the chest I found before.
<es>

@1150
<en>{Ran}\n"This... it's my...!! Yay! Yay! It's my money!!"
<es>

@1151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I thought so."
<es>

@1155
<en>{Ran}\n"How did you get it? Where did you find it?"
<es>

@1156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. You know..."
<es>

@1162
<en>Rrrrrrumble...
<es>

@1163
<en>I was about to explain what happened, but then we heard the ground start rumbling. A moment later, those rumbles turned into violent shaking.
<es>

@1164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1165
<en>{Ran}\n"An earthquake?"
<es>

@1167
<en>The shaking of the ground grew more and more intense. Rocks started falling from the ceiling.
<es>

@1170
<en>{Ran}\n"W-we're in danger!"
<es>

@1171
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's going to collapse!"
<es>

@1172
<en>I bolted to my feet, still holding Ran. It was hard to stand up like this, but this wasn't exactly the moment to complain.
<es>

@1173
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We're running!"
<es>

@1174
<en>{Ran}\n"OK!"
<es>

@1176
<en>I held the chest under my arm to one side and Ran's hand from the other as we started to run.
<es>

@1177
<en>Rocks, small and large, were falling on us from above. The rock ceiling was falling apart.
<es>

@1178
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We're going to get buried alive!!"
<es>

@1181
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, Kazushi! Look down! DOWN!"
<es>

@1184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1185
<en>Ran ordered me to stop as I was looking up and running. She yanked on my hand.
<es>

@1186
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wha-? Hey?!"
<es>

@1187
<en>It felt like my arm was going to come off or something. Ran pulled on my hand as hard as she could, but I could see why she did it.
<es>

@1188
<en>The ground in front of us was splitting with a huge crack.
<es>

@1189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uwah? Waaaaah?!"
<es>

@1190
<en>The crack became a massive sinkhole in the ground, and we saw a mass of blue: the sea.
<es>

@1191
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, uwah, aaaah!"
<es>

@1192
<en>I was running for my life as hard as I could. It was impossible to suddenly stop. I couldn't stop in time and fell towards the water...
<es>

@1195
<en>{Ran}\n"No!!!"
<es>

@1198
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Woah?!"
<es>

@1203
<en>I felt the ground falling apart, and my body was in the air. The sea was underneath, but my body stopped, hanging in the air.
<es>

@1204
<en>{Ran}\n"K-Kazushi!!"
<es>

@1205
<en>Ran wouldn't let go of my hand.
<es>

@1206
<en>{Ran}\n"K-Kazushi! Come on! Climb up!!"
<es>

@1207
<en>She was holding onto my hand with both of hers. But it was the most she could do with her power.
<es>

@1208
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran, take this..."
<es>

@1209
<en>I lifted the chest I held in my left hand. It was the chest with all of her money.
<es>

@1210
<en>{Ran}\n"No! I can't reach it! Just let go of it and climb up."
<es>

@1211
<en>I can't believe she said that.
<es>

@1212
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But this is yours! In the worst case scenario I can always swim. You've got to take this now!"
<es>

@1213
<en>OK so I lied. I can't really swim, but oh well.
<es>

@1214
<en>{Ran}\n"You idiot! Do you know how high up we are? If I drop you, then you'll die!"
<es>

@1215
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I did survive the bridge..."
<es>

@1216
<en>{Ran}\n"You idiot! Do you know how I felt, seeing you fall from that bridge?"
<es>

@1217
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm not letting you go this time. If you're going to fall then I'm going with you!"

<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't say that! Do you know what'll happen if you fell from this height?"
<es>

@1219
<en>{Ran}\n"That's why I'm telling you to let go of the damn box and climb back up!"
<es>

@1220
<en>...Ran called her money "the damn box"?
<es>

@1221
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK. Then I'll let go. Are you sure?"
<es>

@1222
<en>{Ran}\n"Hurry!!"
<es>

@1223
<en>The chest was tiny, barely larger than my hand, but my fingers were frozen with tension at the thought of letting it go. I had to move my fingers with all my might.
<es>

@1224
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Farewell!!!"
<es>

@1225
<en>The chest fell out of my hand and disappeared quickly.
<es>

@1226
<en>{Ran}\n"Hurry up and climb!"
<es>

@1227
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know!"
<es>

@1228
<en>SPLASH!
<es>

@1229
<en>I thought I heard the chest splashing into the water as I climbed up the hole.
<es>

@1230
<en>{Ran}\n"Here! Grab on!"
<es>

@1231
<en>I grabbed into a rock with my left hand to stabilize my body. I wasn't hanging in the air anymore.
<es>

@1232
<en>{Ran}\n"Okay, I'm going to pull! One, two!!"
<es>

@1233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nnnnnnngh!!"
<es>

@1234
<en>Ran pulled as hard as she could. I climbed as hard as I could. And finally, I was able to get out of that hole.
<es>

@1244
<en>{Ran}\n"Phew. I thought we were going to die."
<es>

@1245
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Tell me about it. But..."
<es>

@1246
<en>I looked into the sea. I couldn't find the chest with Ran's money anywhere.
<es>

@1247
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you okay with that? It finally came back?"
<es>

@1250
<en>{Ran}\n"Of course I'm not okay! But I couldn't help it! Anyway, this isn't the time for that!!"
<es>

@1251
<en>The ceiling continued on with its collapse. We'd be buried alive if we didn't get out of there immediately!
<es>

@1252
<en>{Ran}\n"Let's run!"
<es>

@1253
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK!!"
<es>

@1262
<en>We were under the academy, but when we emerged it was at the entrance of a cave.
<es>

@1263
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is where it led out too?"
<es>

@1267
<en>{Ran}\n"Phew. We're safe somehow."
<es>

@1268
<en>{Kazushi}\n"At least we're alive."
<es>

@1269
<en>Our knees were shaking and we both sat down on the ground.
<es>

@1270
<en>We couldn't recover the treasure, but at least we were still alive.
<es>

@1271
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Talk about a real vain effort."
<es>

@1274
<en>{Ran}\n"Not really."
<es>

@1275
<en>Ran opened her coin purse. I saw one pretty big gemstone in there.
<es>

@1278
<en>{Ran}\n"There was more than this, but I threw them all out."
<es>

@1279
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You threw it out? You threw away gemstones?"
<es>

@1280
<en>I couldn't imagine her doing that.
<es>

@1283
<en>{Ran}\n"There were stones, gold, and some cash too. Too bad."
<es>

@1284
<en>She threw the gemstone at me as she said that. I barely caught it, but it was heavier than it looked.
<es>

@1287
<en>{Ran}\n"It's yours, Kazushi."
<es>

@1288
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Me? Are you sure?"
<es>

@1289
<en>This was the only thing she got. If she gave it to me, then it really was all in vain for her.
<es>

@1292
<en>{Ran}\n"Sure. You can get a million yen out of it, can't you? Then you won't have to quit school."
<es>

@1293
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But..."
<es>

@1294
<en>{Ran}\n"No buts. I promised your dad, and I always keep my promises."
<es>

@1295
<en>Ran looked content, even though she hadn't made any money out of it. It felt weird.
<es>

@1296
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What about you, Ran?"
<es>

@1299
<en>{Ran}\n"Never mind me. I don't really care anymore."
<es>

@1300
<en>The results were unexpected, but Ran looked satisfyingly refreshed. She grabbed onto my arm with a happy smile.
<es>

@1303
<en>{Ran}\n"I haven't felt so excited for ages. And I found out that there was something more important to me than money."
<es>

@1304
<en>She looked at me with the sunrise reflecting in her eyes. It made me feel embarrassed.
<es>

@1305
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's more important than money?"
<es>

@1306
<en>Ran smiled.
<es>

@1309
<en>{Ran}\n"That ten yen coin wasn't just ten yen. The reason it was so valuable is that it brought me the person I wanted to see."
<es>

@1310
<en>I'd heard that before. The story about when she became lost...
<es>

@1313
<en>{Ran}\n"That time it was my father, but now..."
<es>

@1315
<en>She clenched my arm and snuggled up closer to me.
<es>

@1316
<en>{Kazushi}\n"W-what?"
<es>

@1317
<en>{Ran}\n"I'll never let you go. I realized that I can't compare you with cash. That alone is a reward."
<es>

@1318
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You should have known that from the start."
<es>

@1319
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahaha, oh well."
<es>

@1320
<en>She laughed and came even closer to me. I felt ticklish, but it did feel comforting. We'll be fine together.
<es>

@1321
<en>I could really feel it.
<es>

@1322
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what do you want to do?"
<es>

@1323
<en>We only scored a single gemstone out of all this, and Ran gave it to me, so she didn't earn a single coin.
<es>

@1324
<en>{Ran}\n"We have to earn some money. But it's fine, I feel like I can make millions with you, Kazushi."
<es>

@1325
<en>She smiles strongly, eyes beaming with confidence.
<es>

@1326
<en>{Ran}\n"But, I'm broke for the time being..."
<es>

@1327
<en>And she reached over and kissed me lightly.
<es>

@1328
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What's that for?"
<es>

@1329
<en>{Ran}\n"Heh, heh. Thank you, come again!"
<es>

@1330
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Geh?! Is that kiss...?"
<es>

@1331
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm putting it on a tab until you cash that rock. I'm going to make money using that money."
<es>

@1332
<en>I smiled wryly at her indomitable comment. I think she's going to be just fine.
<es>

@1333
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't worry. We're gonna be great!"
<es>

@1334
<en>Ran looked straight out over the ocean. She was looking at how it shone like the surface of the jewels she was certain to have in the future.
<es>

@1335
<en>Would our future shine as brightly as this ocean?
<es>

@1336
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess you're right. We'll be fine together."
<es>

@1337
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah! Definitely!"
<es>
