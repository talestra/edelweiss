<es>

@15
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Hey! You guys should do the same!"
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, me too?"
<es>

@17
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Of course!"
<es>

@18
<en>We've been caught by Mr.Yagami, because of the tumult. And we were dragged to the staff room.
<es>

@21
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"I'm really sorry."
<es>

@22
<en>Mr.Yagami apologized once again. Ms. Mei looked perplexed and looked down on Mr.Yagami who bowed his head low.
<es>

@25
<en>{Mei}\n"Mr.Yagami, please look up. It is not your fault."
<es>

@26
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm in charge of them. It is part of my job to manage the science lab as well."
<es>

@27
<en>{Mei}\n"Mr.Yagami has nothing to feel guilty about this matter."
<es>

@30
<en>Mr.Yagami finally looked up as Ms. Mei comforted him. But he looked serious.
<es>

@31
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"But, Kazushi is my student. What Kazushi did is same as what I did. I'm taking all the responsibility for this!"
<es>

@34
<en>{Mei}\n"Mr.Yagami, please... My responsibility is heavier than yours."
<es>

@39
<en>{Ran}\n"Ha Ha! They are fighting for the responsibility. Adult must like taking responsibility!"
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't make it sound like it's someone else's problem."
<es>

@44
<en>{Ran}\n"Well..."
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!?"
<es>

@52
<en>{Ran}\n"Ouch!?"
<es>

@53
<en>A star came out of my eyes. I felt the shock like a meteorite hit my head, and I thought my head will be buried into my body.
<es>

@56
<en>{Ran}\n"Ouch!! What are you doing!?"
<es>

@61
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"You guys should be sorry for what you did!!"
<es>

@62
<en>Mr.Yagami usually never gives a knuckle to a girl, but I could tell it was pretty serious this time.
<es>

@63
<en>Ms. Mei is against corporal punishment, but she didn't say anything this time.
<es>

@66
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey! I lost everything myself. So, make it even!"
<es>

@69
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"What?"
<es>

@70
<en>Oh, shit. Mr.Yagami is going back to his "I used to be a bad ass"mode!?
<es>

@71
<en>{Ran}\n"What!!"
<es>

@72
<en>Ran did not show her weak side as she was stared by Mr.Yagami, and she stared back at Mr.Yagami.
<es>

@73
<en>In the shock of being penniless, Ran is acting up.
<es>

@77
<en>{Mei}\n"Ms. Kamoike, I really want you to understand what you did."
<es>

@78
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm not sorry for what I did. I'm not looking back my past! I'm always looking forward!"
<es>

@79
<en>{Mei}\n"You don't grow as a person, if you don't reflect back on your past."
<es>

@82
<en>{Ran}\n"I want to die if I look back in the past and remember all the money I lost!"
<es>

@83
<en>Ran explained and started to cry on my shoulder.
<es>

@84
<en>I thought about how much is "all the money"she has lost, but I felt scared to know the exact amount. I decided not to ask her.
<es>

@85
<en>I have lost 1,000,000 Yen myself... I'd rather be vanished than crying.
<es>

@88
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, I can't understand how the lab was burned down like that."
<es>

@89
<en>{Ran}\n"That is what I want to know."
<es>

@90
<en>I don't know how it happened. I can't understand few things.
<es>

@93
<en>{Mei}\n"So, what did you do, and in what order?"
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well..."
<es>

@97
<en>I told her what we did in order from the beginning. I made few things blur, like when we had sex and stuff.
<es>

@100
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh my..."
<es>

@105
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"You guys have such a guts to have illicit sexual relationship on campus."
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? How did you know?"
<es>

@111
<en>{Ran}\n"You can't lie, Kazushi. It definitely sounded like we did it in the lab."
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you serious? Oh no..."
<es>

@113
<en>We were stared by two teachers.
<es>

@117
<en>{Mei}\n"Body fluid of a man and a woman... That kind of method does exist. But it is too early for you guys to do."
<es>

@122
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh well. I guess we are typical teenager of these days."
<es>

@127
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Kazushi, I need to talk to you later."
<es>

@128
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure."
<es>

@129
<en>I should prepare to be at least half dead.
<es>

@133
<en>{Ran}\n"But, I didn't do anything wrong, right? It's not my fault."
<es>

@138
<en>{Mei}\n"You can't do anything if the engineer is immature. Even if the method was right."
<es>

@139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What was the weird lake and stuff?"
<es>

@140
<en>It felt like we wondered into a different world. What was it all about?
<es>

@144
<en>{Mei}\n"It could be a world reflected by both of your unconsciousness. Some scholar says, a lot of phenomena happens during the process of alchemy are reflections of alchemist's unconsciousness."
<es>

@146
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, it was our unconsciousness? That's deep."
<es>

@150
<en>{Mei}\n"It maybe because of the weird drug you took. If you guys knew how to control your spirit little better, the result could have been 180 degree different."
<es>

@154
<en>{Ran}\n"What about the result??"
<es>

@158
<en>{Mei}\n"The mental world projection is the thing which is popular for a phenomenon to be caused by a process of alchemy. In other words it may be said that the experiment succeeds to here."
<es>

@162
<en>{Ran}\n"Really?"
<es>

@163
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, we were not wrong about that."
<es>

@164
<en>Ms. Mei nodded. Hey, we were pretty good.
<es>

@167
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Is that so! We were almost there!"
<es>

@170
<en>{Mei}\n"But, In your case, the problem starts way before that. You guys did not have a permission to use the lab."
<es>

@173
<en>Ran shrugged her shoulder as she was stared by Ms. Mei. She was pouting her lips.
<es>

@174
<en>{Ran}\n"Because you didn't give me a permission..."
<es>

@176
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, because I thought it was too dangerous for you two to use the lab yourself. Sure enough, this happened. A little bit...no, it went way over my expectations."
<es>

@180
<en>Everybody sigh deeply. Because the whole lab was blown away, and it is a nucleus of our school.
<es>

@181
<en>Perhaps the reason why they only nag about it is because teachers don't know what kind of punishment to give us at this point.
<es>

@184
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Ms. Mei, did you report this to the principal?"
<es>

@189
<en>{Mei}\n"No, not yet. The principal is out of campus today."
<es>

@193
<en>{Ran}\n"That is why we decided to act on it today!"
<es>

@196
<en>{Mei}\n"You are very smart when it comes down to planning a trick. Well, it worked best for all of us for now."
<es>

@200
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Maybe we should discuss about what we can do before you report to the principal."
<es>

@203
<en>Teachers started to talk in whispers.
<es>

@206
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahh... I have a concern..."
<es>

@207
<en>Ran spoke timidly.
<es>

@212
<en>{Mei}\n"You only have one concern? I have countless concerns and worries."
<es>

@213
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, you are not going to tell me to pay for the damages are you? I have no money at all."
<es>

@216
<en>{Mei}\n"You don't have to worry about it. But you better be sorry."
<es>

@217
<en>{Ran}\n"Are you sure? I'll be sorry if you won't make me pay for it."
<es>

@218
<en>Ran put her hands together in front of her and begged the teachers.
<es>

@221
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't beg us like that. We'll do our best, but..."
<es>

@225
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"It depends on what the Principal will say."
<es>

@229
<en>Ring, Ring!
<es>

@232
<en>The phone in the staff room rang. No, it is a fax.
<es>

@234
<en>fax receiving signal.
<es>

@235
<en>The phone stopped ringing and the machine started to send a paper out.
<es>

@238
<en>{Mei}\n"I wonder what it is?"
<es>

@241
<en>Ms. Mei picked up the sheet from the machine.
<es>

@242
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, it's for you, Ms. Kamoike."
<es>

@247
<en>{Ran}\n"Me?"
<es>

@248
<en>{Mei}\n"What are they talking about? Freezing of a property?"
<es>

@251
<en>{Ran}\n"What!?"
<es>

@255
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"This one says...The cancellation of a patent contract? What are they talking about?"
<es>

@258
<en>{Ran}\n"What? What!? What is this all about!?"
<es>

@262
<en>Ring, Ring!
<es>

@265
<en>The phone is ringing this time. Ran answers the phone.
<es>

@268
<en>{Ran}\n"Hello!! What? Mom?"
<es>

@271
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh? A reform fraud!? They took your money? Why!!"
<es>

@272
<en>It sounds like all the problem attacking Ran is about the money.
<es>

@273
<en>{Ran}\n"No! How can it be? I'm really a penniless now!!"
<es>

@274
<en>All her property are gone in a moment.
<es>

@277
<en>{Ran}\n"That bitch!! She really took all of my property!!"
<es>

@280
<en>Ring, Ring!
<es>

@281
<en>The phone rang again. Ran startled, but not answering the phone. She is scared of additional bad news.
<es>

@284
<en>Mr.Yagami answered the phone.
<es>

@287
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Hello, Eiden Gakuin. Oh!! Is this ...!?"
<es>

@290
<en>Mr.Yagami straightens posture. I have never seen him this nervous, and serious.
<es>

@291
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Yes! I'm doing fine! Oh, no, I'm sorry it has been too long... Is everything going well for you, sir?"
<es>

@295
<en>{Ran}\n"It must be an acquaintance. Mr.Yagami seems nervous. Who could he be talking to?"
<es>

@296
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know."
<es>

@300
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!"
<es>

@301
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@302
<en>Mr.Yagami is calling me for some reason.
<es>

@303
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"It's for you. Your father."
<es>

@304
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!?"
<es>

@310
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ouch... My ear is still hurting... That ass hole. How could he be yelling that much over the phone?"
<es>

@311
<en>The phone call was from my dad. Of course, it was about the bike.
<es>

@314
<en>{Ran}\n"Your dad knows Mr.Yagami?"
<es>

@315
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess they went to school together. And Mr.Yagami was my dad's junior."
<es>

@316
<en>Actually, that is all I know about them. I don't understand why Mr.Yagami is so afraid of my dad.
<es>

@319
<en>{Ran}\n"What did your dad say? Was he angry?"
<es>

@320
<en>Ran seems to be worrying about me. I'm sure she could hear him yelling over the phone.
<es>

@321
<en>{Kazushi}\n"He was furious. Well, I knew he would be. But, there is a problem."
<es>

@322
<en>{Ran}\n"What?"
<es>

@323
<en>{Kazushi}\n"He told me to come home if I'm only making the troubles."
<es>

@324
<en>{Ran}\n"What? To take a break?"
<es>

@325
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. To quit school."
<es>

@328
<en>{Ran}\n"What!? No way!?"
<es>

@329
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really."
<es>

@330
<en>I was ready to be beaten but I didn't expect him to tell me to quit school.
<es>

@333
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh my god. You are not going to quit, are you?"
<es>

@334
<en>She asked me timidly. But, I couldn't give her an answer.
<es>

@335
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't want to. But, if he wants me to quit school for real, he'll come and take me home physically."
<es>

@338
<en>{Ran}\n"No way..."
<es>

@339
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes way."
<es>

@340
<en>I'm willing to fight against it, but if my dad gets serious, I'm not sure how much I can hold against him.
<es>

@341
<en>Ran looked down like a wilted flower and stared at her shoes.
<es>

@344
<en>{Ran}\n"I can't take that. I lost all of my money, and now I'm losing you. What am I going to do?"
<es>

@345
<en>I have never seen Ran so depressed, and it moved me to see her like that.
<es>

@346
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't be sad. It's not like I can't see you for rest of my life. I'll fight against him."
<es>

@347
<en>Ran looked sad even if I said that to her. Then she tightens her lips with some kind of determination.
<es>

@350
<en>{Ran}\n"Three days... No, give me two days! I'll do something about it!"
<es>

@351
<en>She sound definite.
<es>

@352
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you going to do?"
<es>

@353
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't know! But, don't worry, I have a plan!"
<es>

@357
<en>As she said that, Ran started to run.
<es>

@359
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!? What is your plan!?"
<es>

@360
<en>Ran disappeared so fast.
<es>

@361
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's gone..."
<es>

@362
<en>What is she going to do? I hope its not something stupid.
<es>

@366
<en>Ran disappeared for two days for real.
<es>

@369
<en>Two days later --
<es>

@373
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!"
<es>

@377
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@378
<en>I heard someone calling my name and felt a shock as I was laying down.
<es>

@382
<en>{Ran}\n"Duh! Don't be a sleepyhead. Wake up!"
<es>

@383
<en>I found Ran sitting on my stomach. She must have jumped on me.
<es>

@384
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm up... Don't jump on people like that. You are not a kid anymore, you know?"
<es>

@387
<en>{Ran}\n"What ever! I found a way to make a fortune at one swoop!"
<es>

@388
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A fortune?"
<es>

@389
<en>Oh, this sound very bad. My very accurate sixth sense is telling me as well.
<es>

@390
<en>I really don't want to listen if I have a choice.
<es>

@395
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not doing anything illegal. Not even stealing."
<es>

@396
<en>What she came up was a stealing. This school has a rumor that some fortune is buried on campus. She wants to find that fortune and make is ours.
<es>

@399
<en>{Ran}\n"It is not stealing. A gold made by an alchemy does not belong to anyone, don't you think?"
<es>

@400
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Isn't it the alchemist's?"
<es>

@403
<en>{Ran}\n"If you say that, then the gold in a gold mine and the gold dust belong to the nature! It's all belong to the earth! Hurray to the earth!!"
<es>

@404
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Calm down."
<es>

@407
<en>{Ran}\n"Does 10,000 Yen bill belong to the Mint Bureau? No, it does not! Therefore, it is OK for us to take it!"
<es>

@408
<en>I think it is a stealing, if you take 10,000 Yen bill from the Mint Bureau.
<es>

@409
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You better calm down and think about this. They say "you may be wearing a rag, but your heart wears a brocade". You know?"
<es>

@412
<en>{Ran}\n"Your heart wears a brocade? I don't understand. I don't mind the ragged cloth, but I need money!"
<es>

@413
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't believe you."
<es>

@416
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, why are you sounding like it doesn't concern you! You might have to quit school if you don't do anything about this!"
<es>

@417
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are right."
<es>

@418
<en>My dad hasn't called me since. It is weird. But, I don't think he will let it go like this. He is very stubborn.
<es>

@421
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't worry. I called him. We still have some time."
<es>

@422
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Who did you call?"
<es>

@425
<en>{Ran}\n"Your dad. I told him we will give his bike back, so we need some time."
<es>

@426
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? You? Called my house? Did you talk to my dad?"
<es>

@429
<en>{Ran}\n"He is very understanding for your dad. He said he'll wait, when I asked him."
<es>

@430
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What else did you talk about?"
<es>

@433
<en>{Ran}\n"He wanted to know who I was, so I made things up, you know?"
<es>

@434
<en>What kind of things? I'm scared to ask her.
<es>

@435
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What did he say?"
<es>

@436
<en>I asked her timidly.
<es>

@439
<en>{Ran}\n"He said "I'll kill Kazushi!"like he really mean it. And then your sister said "I need to talk to him next time"."
<es>

@440
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK..."
<es>

@441
<en>I can't go home anymore...
<es>

@444
<en>{Ran}\n"So, don't worry. I'll save you, Kazushi. I won't let you quit school."
<es>

@447
<en>Ran hold me softly. The hug was like a goddess, but what she is saying and doing are so different, it didn't move me emotionally.
<es>

@448
<en>{Ran}\n"Let's be happy together. Then we can have lots of sex."
<es>

@449
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@452
<en>{Ran}\n"See? It is getting hard. If everything goes well tonight, then let's fuck all day tomorrow."
<es>

@453
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, OK! Sure!"
<es>

@454
<en>Wait a minute. Why am so excited? Maybe I should have a second thought about it?
<es>

@457
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...."
<es>

@458
<en>I've been here at night few times before, but it sure is spooky at night. Maybe because of the European architecture.
<es>

@459
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure about the treasure? You better have some lead."
<es>

@460
<en>She seems reliable somehow tonight. Ran turned around and gave me a smile.
<es>

@463
<en>{Ran}\n"The husband of the principal was an alchemist. And he was the one who taught alchemy to the principal."
<es>

@464
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The principal married her teacher? That is OK?"
<es>

@465
<en>A student and a teacher sounds like a forbidden relationship.
<es>

@466
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, doesn't it sound common?"
<es>

@467
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not really. It's like me and Ms. Mei... You know?"
<es>

@470
<en>{Ran}\n"Ha ha! That is not happening."
<es>

@471
<en>She was convinced easily. I guess it's not happening, but I have a mixed feelings about that.
<es>

@474
<en>{Ran}\n"So, the principal established the school here to have her husband work on the alchemy. It was an alchemistic gift, you know?"
<es>

@475
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A gift? It seems way too much than a gift."
<es>

@476
<en>I looked around in a dark room. How much money and time does it take to make something like this? And then to give it away like that?
<es>

@477
<en>I've heard of people buying a condo for a lover, but this is like buying a whole building or something.
<es>

@478
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, the president is rich. They say this island belongs to the Aozora family. She must be wealthy."
<es>

@479
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She must be! How can you be that rich?"
<es>

<en>{Ran}\n"How did the Aozora family end up with that much wealth? It is hard to say. The family has a long history, but they haven't had any job in particular."
<es>

@483
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You investigated that much?"
<es>

@484
<en>What kind of source does she have? It is an obsession.
<es>

@485
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, you want to say that the Aozora family established their wealth by alchemy?"
<es>

@488
<en>{Ran}\n"That is correct. It's kind of like having own mint bureau in your house. You can get all the money you ever wish for."
<es>

@489
<en>{Ran}\n"In that case, we can steal a little bit. Don't you think?"
<es>

@490
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know about that."
<es>

@491
<en>I still think stealing is a no, no. But, knowing they can create more on their own lifts some guilt off of my shoulders.
<es>

@492
<en>... no, it doesn't. Ran is poisoning me. I have to watch her not to go too far.
<es>

@495
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't know if there are treasures for real, but there is something underground for sure."
<es>

@496
<en>She kicks the floor with her toes.
<es>

@497
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is there an underground on this campus? I've never heard of that."
<es>

@500
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes, there is. No one knows about it, but it is on a plan."
<es>

@501
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You investigated the plan?"
<es>

@502
<en>I was impressed, rather than shocked. Can she use this kind of energy to something else?
<es>

@504
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't know what kind of treasure lies ahead, but it must be a lot of them. It will be enough to cover my loss and your One hundred thousand yen, and still some left."
<es>

@506
<en>Ran is so excited about this treasures on campus.
<es>

@507
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, you better be ready! We'll be so rich by tomorrow morning!"
<es>

@508
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I hope everything goes as we plan."
<es>

@511
<en>{Ran}\n"What are you talking about? I'll make it go as we plan. I'll take care of it!"
<es>

@514
<en>{Ran}\n"Let's go!"
<es>

@516
<en>Ran started to walk. I have no idea what awaits us.
<es>

@521
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh my god..."
<es>

@522
<en>I can't believe this space underground.
<es>

@523
<en>{Ran}\n"See? I told you so. This looks so real, don't you think?"
<es>

@524
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. We might have some ghost too."
<es>

@525
<en>I felt warm, humid air blowing on us. Where is it coming from? It is spooky.
<es>

@526
<en>{Ran}\n"Never mind about the ghosts. Look for treasures. Treasures."
<es>

@527
<en>Ran seems so excited she is almost ready to skip.
<es>

@528
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey! Don't go too far. It's dangerous to walk alone!"
<es>

@529
<en>{Ran}\n"It's OK. I can handle it..."
<es>

@531
<en>.....
<es>

@532
<en>....
<es>

@533
<en>What? Ran disappeared.
<es>

@534
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@535
<en>I heard her upset voice. From underneath?
<es>

@536
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Ran!?"
<es>

@537
<en>{Ran}\n"Help me!!"
<es>

@538
<en>I heard the voice coming out from the bottom of the earth. Sure enough, Ran was hanging onto the edge of a big hole on the ground.
<es>

@539
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm falling!"
<es>

@540
<en>She was barely hanging onto the edge of the hole.
<es>

@541
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait! I'll help you!!"
<es>

@542
<en>{Ran}\n"Please hurry!"
<es>

@547
<en>{Ran}\n"What is this hole!?"
<es>

@548
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, it seems like a trap."
<es>

@550
<en>We looked into the hole. There is a huge frog looking mountains of swords, and bones of something dead...
<es>

@553
<en>{Ran}\n"Is that an animal?"
<es>

@554
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mm, maybe a dog or a cat. Well, it is big enough to be like a small bear?"
<es>

@557
<en>{Ran}\n"The shape is kind of like a monkey. Ha-ha..."
<es>

@558
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ha ha..."
<es>

@561
<en>{Ran}\n"...."
<es>

@562
<en>Is it OK to keep going like this? What kind of traps are we going to encounter?
<es>

@565
<en>{Ran}\n"Are you scared? Don't you want money? Which is more important to you, money or your life!?"
<es>

@566
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think your life is more important to me, Ran."
<es>

@567
<en>{Ran}\n"What a wuss! How do you suppose to fight against all the competitions in the real world..."
<es>

@570
<en>{Ran}\n"What? What did you say? Did you say my life is more important to you?"
<es>

@571
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We don't need money. We should go back if you are going to be in danger like that one more time."
<es>

@574
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, your lip service is good! How much you want from me!?"
<es>

@575
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, no. I don't need any money from you."
<es>

@578
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, 500 yen, no, maybe I can pay one thousand yen for that. Oh, I remembered! I am penniless!!"
<es>

@580
<en>She looked into her purse and she was depressed. But, was she really going to pay me for that?
<es>

@583
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, I hate this! Not having money at all is so hard! I really need this treasures."
<es>

@586
<en>{Ran}\n"OK, Let's go, Kazushi!"
<es>

@588
<en>Ran became even more excited, and took my hand and started to walk.
<es>

@589
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm telling you, it is dangerous."
<es>

@592
<en>{Ran}\n"It is your job to save me. Come on! Hurry up!"
<es>

@593
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok, Ok."
<es>

@594
<en>She is not listening to me. I have to save her if something happens, just like she says.
<es>

@598
<en>sound of footsteps
<es>

@599
<en>How long did we walk? I can hear the footsteps repeating over and over.
<es>

@602
<en>{Ran}\n"How far is it going?"
<es>

@603
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are we lost? It seems like we are going in circles."
<es>

@604
<en>{Ran}\n"Are you sure? Well, we can't reach anywhere like this. It is strange."
<es>

@607
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you want to go back?"
<es>

@610
<en>{Ran}\n"Well... let me try something before that."
<es>

@611
<en>Ran stopped and looking at the wall.
<es>

@612
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What did you see?"
<es>

@615
<en>{Ran}\n"It's common to find a hidden door, or a hidden switch. Let me try some."
<es>

@616
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's only in movies..."
<es>

@618
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow..."
<es>

@619
<en>The hand of Ran disappeared into a wall.
<es>

@623
<en>{Ran}\n"I pushed something!"
<es>

@624
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What kind of switch was it!?"
<es>

@625
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't know..."
<es>

@628
<en>The sound of ground shaking
<es>

@629
<en>It sounds like an earthquake.
<es>

@632
<en>{Ran}\n"Maybe I know what it is."
<es>

@634
<en>Ran got her hand out of the wall and hang onto my arm.
<es>

@635
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Me too."
<es>

@636
<en>This sound...
<es>

@637
<en>It was coming from the way we came in. We felt a cool breeze blowing on us from the darkness.
<es>

@643
<en>{Ran}\n"I knew this was going to happen!!"
<es>

@648
<en>We saw a wave coming to us after the breeze as we expected. Waves of water was gushing to us through the hallway.
<es>

@649
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We got to run!!"
<es>

@652
<en>{Ran}\n"OK!!"
<es>

@654
<en>I took her hand and started to run.
<es>

@656
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh!"
<es>

@659
<en>Her hand was pulled out of my hand with a strong force.
<es>

@660
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@661
<en>I stopped to look back. Ran was falling on the ground face down. I saw a tidal wave gushing so close to her.
<es>

@665
<en>{Ran}\n"Ouch...I hit my face..."
<es>

@666
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@668
<en>I could only lay on top to cover her. The next moment, gushing water came over us and we disappeared into the water.
<es>

@675
<en>Drip... Drip...
<es>

@676
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@677
<en>I woke up to the sound of dripping water.
<es>

@678
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where am I?"
<es>

@679
<en>I can't see around, because it is so dark.
<es>

@680
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@681
<en>I looked for Ran in the darkness, but I remembered that she was in my arms all this time.
<es>

@682
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh... thank god."
<es>

@683
<en>I guess I didn't let her go in all that turmoil.
<es>

@684
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran! Ran!"
<es>

@685
<en>{Ran}\n"..."
<es>

@686
<en>She is unconscious, but her breathing was fine. I can't decide if she is just sleeping, but I can hear her rhythmic breathing.
<es>

@687
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess we weren't in the water too long..."
<es>

@688
<en>I felt relieved that we are both fine. Then, anxiety comes back. Where are we?
<es>

@689
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran! Hey, wake up."
<es>

@691
<en>Slap. Slap.
<es>

@692
<en>I slapped her cheek.
<es>

@693
<en>{Ran}\n"Mm... Five more yen..."
<es>

@694
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The unit is wrong. It should be minutes."
<es>

@695
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@696
<en>Ran opened her eyes. But, we can't see anything because of the darkness.
<es>

@697
<en>{Ran}\n"What? I can't see anything?"
<es>

@698
<en>I guess she woke up. She was surprised to wake up to the darkness as well.
<es>

@699
<en>{Ran}\n"Is this Kazushi? Are you?"
<es>

@700
<en>She was touching my face.
<es>

@701
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, it's me. Are you Ran?"
<es>

@702
<en>I felt for her tits. Of course on purpose.
<es>

@703
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow! Hey, don't touch it!"
<es>

@705
<en>Slap!
<es>

@706
<en>She slapped my hand.
<es>

@707
<en>{Ran}\n"You are so sneaky for a peasant."
<es>

@708
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that what the problem?"
<es>

@709
<en>{Ran}\n"I'll make you pay for this when we find the treasures. We should do something we've never done for an additional charge!"
<es>

@710
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is that? I'm not sure what it is, but are you sure?"
<es>

@711
<en>I'm fantasying...
<es>

@712
<en>{Ran}\n"Sure, if you can pay for it."
<es>

@713
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow! So, it does come down to money."
<es>

@714
<en>{Ran}\n"Of course! It's all about the money."
<es>

@715
<en>I can do anything I want if I find the treasures and come back alive. My dreams colored the darkness.
<es>

@716
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, I we can't do anything in this darkness. We need some light."
<es>

@717
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, did you bring a lighter?"
<es>

@718
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, but I got a match. I try to get a lighter at the cafeteria, but I got caught and gave me a match."
<es>

@719
<en>I put it in a plastic bag, so it did not get wet. That was a lucky thing.
<es>

@720
<en>{Ran}\n"A match? Who use a match in these days? It'll go out in a second."
<es>

@721
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We need something to burn. Is there anything around here?"
<es>

@723
<en>Noise.
<es>

@724
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mm?"
<es>

@725
<en>I felt a dry paper touching my finger tip as I reached out. Is this a trash bin? I felt more paper in stacks.
<es>

@726
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok, we should burn this."
<es>

@727
<en>{Ran}\n"Hurry, hurry."
<es>

@729
<en>I struck a match. A small flame lights up the room. But the flame is too small, we can't see too far.
<es>

@730
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Stay away from me."
<es>

@732
<en>I picked up more trash and burn them also. The flame became larger and started to light the room.
<es>

@733
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow, we can see!"
<es>

@741
<en>The flame was getting bigger and we can now see inside the room.
<es>

@744
<en>{Ran}\n"That's nice to find a trash..."
<es>

@747
<en>Ran shut up all the sudden.
<es>

@748
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, what are you burning?"
<es>

@749
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? It's a trash.... Oh shit!"
<es>

@750
<en>I'm caught by surprise again. I thought it was a trash, but it was a bill. A ten thousand yen bill.
<es>

@753
<en>{Ran}\n"That is a ten thousand yen bill, if I'm not mistaking!"
<es>

@754
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What's going on? Why are all these money doing here?"
<es>

@755
<en>You can only laugh now. All these money are catching on fire and they are burning good.
<es>

@756
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ha ha ha"
<es>

@757
<en>{Ran}\n"....!"
<es>

@758
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh shit!?"
<es>

@759
<en>The devil! That devil again! Is this hell?
<es>

@760
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I couldn't see at all in the dark! It's not my fault! Ran didn't notice it either!"
<es>

@763
<en>{Ran}\n"No, no!! Money is burning!! No!!"
<es>

@764
<en>She regressed mentally for a moment. Ran started baling and threw a tantrum on the ground. It was like a kid in a toy store.
<es>

@765
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran, we should think positive! If all this money are all over the place like this here, we should have some more over there!"
<es>

@768
<en>{Ran}\n"Really?"
<es>

@769
<en>Ran looked up with tears in her eyes. Her face looked like a devil a moment ago, but now looked like a small child.
<es>

@770
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah! The fortune you were talking about shouldn't be this little, right?"
<es>

@771
<en>{Ran}\n"... Yeah, I guess so."
<es>

@772
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well then, this is just a start of it. There must be more treasures somewhere else."
<es>

@775
<en>{Ran}\n"Do you think so?"
<es>

@776
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure, there must be! Believe me!"
<es>

@779
<en>{Ran}\n"Ok! I believe you! There must be more! We must find it!"
<es>

@783
<en>She found a piece of wood, and she put it in a flame. She made an instant torch.
<es>

@784
<en>{Ran}\n"Treasures, here we come!"
<es>

@786
<en>She stepped forward, but stopped suddenly. Ran raised the torch and looking into something. It seems to be a dead-end.
<es>

@789
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!"
<es>

@790
<en>She reached out her hand looking forward.
<es>

@791
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@792
<en>The torch shined her face, and it looked pale like a paper. I wonder what she is looking at?
<es>

@793
<en>{Ran}\n"What do you think that is?"
<es>

@794
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@796
<en>It was displayed along the wall. And it seems to be swaying by the light of the torch.
<es>

@800
<en>There was a shelf along the wall, and many glass jar was placed in it. It looked like a specimen.
<es>

@801
<en>A small dead animal, some kind of intestinal parts... It was something you see in a science lab, but the numbers were outrageous.
<es>

@802
<en>{Ran}\n"What is this? This is gross."
<es>

@803
<en>Ran hid behind my back. She usually doesn't get emotional, but this was too much for her.
<es>

@804
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What happened here?"
<es>

@805
<en>I've seen something like this before. That was when we went to the local temple for the visit.
<es>

@806
<en>I saw numerous gravestones lined up for people without any relatives to pray for their soul.
<es>

@807
<en>The glass jars lined up made me bring back that memory.
<es>

@810
<en>{Ran}\n"So, this is it? Where is the fortune?"
<es>

@811
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This can't be a fortune..."
<es>

@814
<en>{Ran}\n"Stop it. This can't be a fortune. But, wait. Will some maniac person buy this for a lot of money?"
<es>

@815
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, calm down. I don't like that kind of way of thinking..."
<es>

@818
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm joking. You sound like a mother-in-law."
<es>

@819
<en>It sounds serious when she talks like that.
<es>

@820
<en>{Ran}\n"I hope the treasure was not that money burning over there."
<es>

@821
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this an alchemy facility or something? If so, maybe we can find something made with alchemy here."
<es>

@824
<en>{Ran}\n"That's right. We shouldn't be too far off, don't you think?"
<es>

@825
<en>We stuck together and looked around.
<es>

@826
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@827
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it this time?"
<es>

@828
<en>Ran is looking into some whole in a rocky wall.
<es>

@831
<en>{Ran}\n"See? There is some written message."
<es>

@832
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@834
<en>We lighted up the wall with a torch. I can see some script engraved there.
<es>

@835
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A, I, shi, te, ru...?"
<es>

@836
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@839
<en>{Ran}\n"I think it says I love you."
<es>

@840
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah. It sure is."
<es>

@843
<en>{Ran}\n"Hold on. There are more underneath."
<es>

@844
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Hi, sa... It's blur. I can't see it well."
<es>

@845
<en>{Ran}\n"Isn't it a name?"
<es>

@846
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, it is a message to some one."
<es>

@847
<en>I love you...
<es>

@848
<en>This message doesn't match the environment. I wonder who left it here.
<es>

@851
<en>{Ran}\n"But, it doesn't look like there are any treasures..."
<es>

@852
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah..."
<es>

@854
<en>We kept lighting around with the torch. We didn't see anything worthy, but then, we found it.
<es>

@862
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow! A treasure box?"
<es>

@863
<en>It looked like a treasure box you see in a book. It looks unreal because it looks just like the one you imagine of a treasure box.
<es>

@866
<en>{Ran}\n"What is it? What do you think is in this?"
<es>

@867
<en>Ran is opening the box without thinking.
<es>

@868
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait! We better take it slow..."
<es>

@871
<en>{Ran}\n"Here!"

<es>

@877

@880
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran, this way..."
<es>

@882
<en>I reached out for Ran who should be standing next to me, but I couldn't reach her.
<es>

@883

<es>

@884
<en>I heard her voice. But I couldn't reach her.
<es>

@889

@900
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"Did you drop this gold Kazushi? Or this silver Kazushi?"

<en>Wow, she chose me! She did learn from the past!
<es>

@912
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"Then, this gold Kazushi, and this three hundred million yen. Which did you drop?"
<es>

@916
<en>{Ran}\n"What! Three hundred million yen?"
<es>

@917
<en>She is responding to that! A gold Kazushi and three hundred million? Where am I?
<es>

@920
<en>{Ran}\n"Three hundred million yen... I wonder how much this gold Kazushi be in cash. What was the rate for the gold now?"
<es>

@921
<en>She is calculating? And she is comparing Gold Kazushi and the cash.
<es>

@931
<en>{Ran}\n"You can't fool me! Where is Kazushi? I want Kazushi back!!"
<es>

@932
<en>She yelled and picked up a rock by her feet.
<es>

@933
<en>{Ran}\n"I want Kazushi back!!"
<es>

@935
<en>She threw the rock as hard as she can. The rock flew straight to the Lake Fairy, and hit her.
<es>

@942
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow!!?"
<es>

@943
<en>The light exploded like a bomb.
<es>

@944
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@945
<en>The light disappeared like it was sucked into something.
<es>

@955
<en>{Ran}\n"What?"
<es>

@956
<en>She found herself in a underground room. The Lake Fairy is gone. The bonfire we made is still burning and shining around.
<es>

@957
<en>Ran was standing there alone.
<es>

@960
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi? Where are you?"
<es>

@961

<es>

@962
<en>{Ran}\n"Again..."
<es>

@963
<en>She walked toward it cautiously, but the lid was already open and some light was coming out of it.
<es>

@964
<en>{Ran}\n"What is this?"
<es>

@965
<en>She opened it.
<es>

@968
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow, too bright!"
<es>

@969
<en>She found a mountains of treasures inside. There are precious stones and gold. It sure was dazzling treasures.
<es>

@970
<en>{Ran}\n"Why? Oh! Is because I made a honest answer?"
<es>

@971
<en>I told her it wasn't either gold or silver Kazushi honestly. Oh yes. The honest person gets reward.
<es>

@972
<en>{Ran}\n"But, this is not right! Where is Kazushi? Kazushi??"
<es>

@973
<en>The treasures did not please her now. She can't find Kazushi. And that is making her worry.
<es>

@974
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Where are you? Kazushi!"
<es>

@975
<en>She walked around. She is almost breaking into tears, and walking around. It looked like a lost child.
<es>

@976
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh shit. He is gone. Where is Kazushi? Don't leave me here alone."
<es>

@977
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!! Where are you? Kazushi!!"
<es>

@978
<en>Kazushi didn't come back. And the treasure box was left to replace Kazushi.
<es>

@979
<en>{Ran}\n"Such a crap..."
<es>

@980
<en>How much would this be in cash? But it did not make Ran happy.
<es>

@981
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! I found the treasure! Look! You never seen this much of treasures before! Kazushi, look at this!"
<es>

@982
<en>The person she wants to show it is not here. The person she wants to share this happiness is not here.
<es>

@983
<en>{Ran}\n"What a crap..."
<es>

@984
<en>She put her hand into the treasure box. She grabbed the treasures like a trash and kept emptying the box.
<es>

@985
<en>{Ran}\n"Crap! Crap!"
<es>

@986
<en>She scooped out a big diamond and a gold bar, throwing everything out of the box.
<es>

@987
<en>{Ran}\n"I will give it all back, so give Kazushi back to me!"
<es>

@988

<es>

@989

<es>

@1014
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!"
<es>

@1015
<en>That bitch again!! She took everything from Ran and still not enough? Is she trying to take more money from me?
<es>

@1016
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Too bad. I don't have any. You took my hundred thousand yen from me."
<es>

@1017
<en>I touched my pocket. I felt the cold coin on my fingertips.
<es>

@1018
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See! I only have a coin!"
<es>

@1020
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"....."
<es>

@1021
<en>But she is still staring at me.
<es>

@1022
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@1023
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"...Kazushi"
<es>

@1024
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Don't call me like that."
<es>

@1025
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"Kazu, shi... Kazushi..."
<es>

@1026
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@1027
<en>Something is not right. The face looked like she was about to cry, and she looked like a lost child.
<es>

@1028
<en>That face remained me of someone.
<es>

@1029
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran?"
<es>

@1030
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@1031
<en>She calls my name. It is Ran. Ran is overlapping with the Lake Fairy.
<es>

@1032
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"Kazushi...money..."
<es>

@1033
<en>She can't be happy with all that money? She probably can't be happy forever.
<es>

@1034
<en>She can't be happy, and she doesn't know what she really want to be happy. So she is wondering. It's just like a lost kid.
<es>

@1035
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let it go."
<es>

@1036
<en>I clinched a coin in my pocket. This is the coin which saved her when she was a child and lost.
<es>

@1037
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is what you wanted to find!"
<es>

@1038
<en>I threw the coin into the fountain. The coin disappeared into the fountain.
<es>

@1041
<en>The fountain flashed a bright light at that moment.
<es>

@1042
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!!?"
<es>

@1045
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's gone..."
<es>

@1046
<en>The lights disappeared and I found myself in a dark space. Where did that fountain and the spirit go?
<es>

@1047
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mm?"
<es>

@1048
<en>I found a small treasure box at my feet.
<es>

@1049
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is..."
<es>

@1050
<en>A bankbook? It says Ran Kamoike. And more bankbooks.
<es>

@1051
<en>They are all in Ran's name. I opened it and surprised.
<es>

@1052
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow... She have a lot..."
<es>

@1053
<en>I should marry her. But why is her bankbooks here? I thought all of her money was gone...
<es>

@1054
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, is this the money the spirit took from Ran?"
<es>

@1055
<en>Did the spirit gave it back to Ran? I'm not sure if it is all the money, but I'm sure Ran will be happy.
<es>

@1056
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah. I have to find Ran."
<es>

@1057
<en>I started to run.
<es>

@1060
<en>At that moment, I felt a hard shake and I hit the ground.
<es>

@1061
<en>{Kazushi}\n"An earthquake?"
<es>

@1062
<en>{Ran}\n"Fuck you! Asshole!!!"
<es>

@1063
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Ran?"
<es>

@1064
<en>It was Ran's voice.
<es>

@1072
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!"
<es>

@1073
<en>Ran was breaking everything she can put her hands on calling Kazushi's name.
<es>

@1074

<es>

@1075
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey!"
<es>

@1078
<en>Ran stopped and listened to his voice.
<es>

@1079
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi? Kazushi??"
<es>

@1080
<en>She looked around, but no one is there.
<es>

@1083
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!? Where are you?"
<es>

@1084
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Here! Right here!"
<es>

@1085
<en>She looked around trying to find where the voice is coming from and she found it.
<es>

@1086
<en>{Ran}\n"In the box?"
<es>

@1087
<en>Under the upside down box. That is where his voice was coming from.
<es>

@1088
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@1089
<en>Ran jumped onto the box. She picked up the box and looked inside of it.
<es>

@1092
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@1093
<en>She found Kazushi.
<es>

@1094
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@1095
<en>He was in the box, but not crammed into the box. Kazushi was in a dark, square room.
<es>

@1096
<en>The reduced scale is wrong. Kazushi looks so small and far in the box.
<es>

@1097
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@1103
<en>I heard her voice. It's Ran. And the voice is coming from above.
<es>

@1104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@1105
<en>I looked up and surprised. The ceiling was dark but now, Ran is looking into the room from above.
<es>

@1106
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@1107
<en>Ran is calling me, but the scale is wrong. It feels like the giant is looking into the room.
<es>

@1108
<en>But, it sure is Ran over there.
<es>

@1109
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@1110
<en>I reached my hand above my head. Ran should be able to catch me.
<es>

@1111
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, hold on!"
<es>

@1112
<en>Ran knew what I was trying to do. She was hesitant, but reached her hand toward me.
<es>

@1113
<en>{Ran}\n"Grab on!!"
<es>

@1114
<en>Ran's hand came close. The strange thing was that she looked like a giant before, but now her hands are same as my size.
<es>

@1115
<en>{Ran}\n"Hurry!"
<es>

@1116
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK!"
<es>

@1117
<en>I grabbed her hand. It made me relaxed to feel the familiar warms.
<es>

@1118
<en>{Ran}\n"I'll pull you up!"
<es>

@1119
<en>She grabbed my hand tight, and pulled as hard as she could. I felt my body lift up.
<es>

@1120
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Wow!!"
<es>

@1121
<en>My body was lifted up, and the ceiling came closer and closer.
<es>

@1122
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!"
<es>

@1123
<en>Then I was pulled out of the square ceiling to the outside world.
<es>

@1132
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@1134
<en>Ran catch my body I was coming out. But I was too heavy, we both fell on the ground.
<es>

@1137
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!"
<es>

@1138
<en>Ran held me tight as we lay on the ground.
<es>

@1139
<en>It was almost too tight, but it made me feel relaxed.
<es>

@1140
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm saved. Thanks."
<es>

@1141
<en>She made me surprised as I looked up and saw her face.
<es>

@1142
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you crying?"
<es>

@1145
<en>{Ran}\n"What?"
<es>

@1146
<en>Ran looked surprised. Her face was covered with tears.
<es>

@1147
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm not crying...huh?"
<es>

@1148
<en>She touched her face, and surprised. She looked at her wet fingertips confusedly.
<es>

@1149
<en>{Ran}\n"No? It can't be."
<es>

@1150
<en>Her tears were gushing out after another. It was beautiful. I thought her tears are more beautiful than any precious stones.
<es>

@1151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't cry. I'm fine now."
<es>

@1152
<en>It was my turn to hold Ran.
<es>

@1153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm fine now."
<es>

@1156
<en>{Ran}\n"Ok... Ok!"
<es>

@1157
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Look. This is yours, right?"
<es>

@1158
<en>I opened the box I found before.
<es>

@1159
<en>{Ran}\n"This... is mine! Oh my god! It's my money!!"
<es>

@1160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I thought so."
<es>

@1164
<en>{Ran}\n"How did you get it? Where did you find it?"
<es>

@1165
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah.. You know..."
<es>

@1170
<en>Ground shaking
<es>

@1171
<en>I was about to explain what happened, and then we heard the sound of ground shaking. A moment later, the ground started to shake.
<es>

@1172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1173
<en>{Ran}\n"An earthquake?"
<es>

@1175
<en>The shaking of the ground became bigger and bigger. The rocks started to fall from the ceiling.
<es>

@1178
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh my god!"
<es>

@1179
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's going to crush!"
<es>

@1180
<en>I stood up in a second still holding Ran. It is hard to stand up like this but this is not the time to complain.
<es>

@1181
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We got to get out of here!"
<es>

@1182
<en>{Ran}\n"OK!"
<es>

@1184
<en>I held a box under my arm on one side, and held Ran's hand on other side, and we started to run.
<es>

@1185
<en>The rocks small and large are falling on us from above. The rock ceiling is falling apart.
<es>

@1186
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We going to get buried alive!!"
<es>

@1189
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, kazushi! Look down! Down!!"
<es>

@1192
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1193
<en>Ran called me to stop as I was looking up and running. She pulled on my hand.
<es>

@1194
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1195
<en>It felt like my arm would come off or something. Ran pulled my hand as hard as she can. But I see why she did that.
<es>

@1196
<en>The ground in front of us was cracking huge.
<es>

@1197
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!"
<es>

@1198
<en>The crack became a huge hole in the ground, and we saw a blue color. A sea.
<es>

@1199
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow! Shit!!"
<es>

@1200
<en>I was running as hard as I could for my life, it's impossible to stop suddenly. I couldn't stop in time and jumped into the sea...
<es>

@1203
<en>{Ran}\n"No!!!"
<es>

@1206
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!?"
<es>

@1210

<es>

@1211
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@1212
<en>Ran did not let go of my hand.
<es>

@1213
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Come on! Climb up!!"
<es>

@1214

<es>

@1215
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran, take this..."
<es>

@1216
<en>I lifted the box I held in my left hand. It was a box with all of her money.
<es>

@1217
<en>{Ran}\n"No! I can't reach it! Let it go and climb up!"
<es>

@1218
<en>I can't believe she was saying that.
<es>

@1219
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, this is yours! I can swim in the worst case scenario. You got to take this now!"
<es>

@1220
<en>In a real life, I can't swim, but oh well.
<es>

@1221
<en>{Ran}\n"Idiot! You know how high we are? If you drop, you'll be dead!!"
<es>

@1222
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I survived that bridge..."
<es>

@1223
<en>{Ran}\n"Idiot! Do you know how I felt seeing you falling from that bridge?"
<es>

<es>

@1226
<en>{Ran}\n"That's why I'm telling you to let that box go and climb up."
<es>

@1227
<en>Ran is calling her money a "that box"?
<es>

@1228
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK. Then I'll let it go. Are you sure?"
<es>

@1229
<en>{Ran}\n"Hurry!"
<es>

@1230
<en>It is just a small box I need to let go, but my fingers were frozen with the tension. I moved the fingers as hard as I can.
<es>

@1231
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Farewell!!!"
<es>

@1232
<en>The box fell out of my hand. And the box disappeared fast.
<es>

<en>I grabbed onto the rock with left hand to stable my body. My body was not in the air anymore.
<es>

@1239
<en>{Ran}\n"Ok, I'll pull now! Here!!"
<es>

@1240
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mm....."
<es>

@1241
<en>Ran pulled as hard as she could. I climbed as hard as I could. And I finally was able to get out of that hole.
<es>

@1250
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh my god. I thought we would be dead."
<es>

@1251
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Tell me about it. But..."
<es>

@1252
<en>I looked into the sea. I couldn't find Ran's small box anywhere.
<es>

@1253
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure about that? It came back, you know?"
<es>

@1256
<en>{Ran}\n"I am not sure about it!! But what else could I do? Anyway, it is not relevant right now!!"
<es>

@1257
<en>The falling of the ceiling continued. We'll be buried alive if we don't get out right now.
<es>

@1258
<en>{Ran}\n"Let's go!"
<es>

@1259
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK!!"
<es>

@1267
<en>We were in underground of the campus, but when we came out, it was at the entrance of a cave.
<es>

@1268
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is where it was connected?"
<es>

@1272
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh my god. We are saved."
<es>

@1273
<en>{Kazushi}\n"At least we are alive."
<es>

@1274
<en>Our knees were shaking. And we both sad down on the ground.
<es>

@1275
<en>We couldn't get the treasure. But at least we are still alive.
<es>

@1276
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It sure was "great pains but all in vain". Don't you think?"
<es>

@1279
<en>{Ran}\n"Not really."
<es>

@1280
<en>Ran opened her coin purse. I saw a precious stone in there. It's pretty big.
<es>

@1283
<en>{Ran}\n"There was more than this, but I threw it out."
<es>

@1284
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You threw it out? These precious stones?"
<es>

@1285
<en>I can't imagine her doing that.
<es>

@1288
<en>{Ran}\n"There was precious stones, gold, and cash also. Too bad."
<es>

@1289
<en>She said so, and threw a precious stone to me. I barely caught it. It was heavier than I thought it would be.
<es>

@1292
<en>{Ran}\n"It's yours, Kazushi."
<es>

@1293
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Me? Are you sure?"
<es>

@1294
<en>This was only one she got. If she gave it to me, then it really is "great pains but all in vain"for her.
<es>

@1297
<en>{Ran}\n"Sure. You can get one hundred thousand yen out of it, can't you? Then, you don't have to quit school."
<es>

@1298
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But..."
<es>

@1299
<en>{Ran}\n"No buts. I promised your dad. I have to keep my promise."
<es>

@1300
<en>Ran looked refreshed, although she did not make any money out of it. It feels weird.
<es>

@1301
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How about you?"
<es>

@1304
<en>{Ran}\n"Never mind about me. I don't care that much anymore."
<es>

@1305
<en>The result was not what we have expected, but Ran looked refreshed. She grab onto my arm with a happy smile.
<es>

@1308
<en>{Ran}\n"I haven't felt so excited for a while. And I found out that I had something more important than money."
<es>

@1309
<en>She was looking at me with an eyes reflecting a sunrise. It make me feel embarrassed.
<es>

@1310
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@1311
<en>Ran smiled.
<es>

@1314
<en>{Ran}\n"That 10 yen coin was not just a ten yen. It was so valuable because it brought the person I wanted to see."
<es>

@1315
<en>I heard that before. That story about when she became lost.
<es>

@1318
<en>{Ran}\n"That time was my parent, but now..."
<es>

@1320
<en>She grabbed my arm hard, and she got closer to me.
<es>

@1321
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1322
<en>{Ran}\n"I'll never let you go. I realized that I can't compare you with cash. It was nice thing to notice."
<es>

@1323
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You should have known that."
<es>

@1324
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, at least I did!"
<es>

@1325
<en>She laughed and came even closer to me. I felt ticklish, but it did feel relaxing. We'll be fine together...
<es>

@1326
<en>I really feel so.
<es>

@1327
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what do you want to do?"
<es>

@1328
<en>We only have one precious stone out of all this. And Ran gave it to me, so she doesn't have anything left.
<es>

@1329
<en>{Ran}\n"We have to make money. But, it's all right. I feel like I can make millions with you, Kazushi."
<es>

@1330
<en>She smiles strongly. Her eyes were filled with confidence.
<es>

@1331
<en>{Ran}\n"But, I'm penniless for time being..."
<es>

@1332
<en>And she reached over and kissed me lightly.
<es>

@1333
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? So sudden?"
<es>

@1334
<en>{Ran}\n"Aha! Thank you!"
<es>

@1335
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Are you??"
<es>

@1336
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm putting it on a tab until you cash that rock. I'm going to make money using that money."
<es>

@1337
<en>I smiled wryly for her indomitable comment. I really think she'll be fine.
<es>

@1338
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't worry! We'll do just fine!"
<es>

@1339
<en>Ran looks straight at the sea. She may be looking at the shine of the surface as a jewels she'll have in a future.
<es>

@1340
<en>Is our future shine as this ocean?
<es>

@1341
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess you're right. We'll be fine."
<es>

@1342
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah. Absolutely!"
<es>
