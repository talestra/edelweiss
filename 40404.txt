<es>

@15
<en>A pudding is mine now. Natsume glares at me with tearful eyes, but a deal is a deal. I eat it with appreciation.
<es>

@16
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi is kinda foxy, though. Because he was swallowing food without chewing."
<es>

<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Somebody?"
<es>

@50
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, Miya."
<es>

@53

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why are you here?"
<es>

<es>

<en>{Amamiya}\n"As a matter of fact, I'm moving in here from today."
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you really moving in?"
<es>

<es>

<es>

@68
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Well, actually, that is an excuse."
<es>

@69
<en>Suddenly, Miya made a stern face and drooped hid shoulders. Something must've happened to him.
<es>

@72
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Actually, I had a dream of Natsume, and that wasn't good one."
<es>

@73
<en>Miya's face gets more stern. I wonder how bad it was. I start to worry a little bit.
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What kind of dream did you have?"
<es>

@75
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I even hate to talk about, but in the dream, Natsume was shedding her blood."
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh...blood?"
<es>

@77
<en>What I visualized first was stains on the sheet. I hope it's not what I am thinking about....
<es>

@78
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I'm aftraid if something will happen to Natsume....I can't let go whoever hurt Natsume. Thanks to you, Kazushi. I'm ready for anything for her."
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean by you can't let go...?"
<es>

@82
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Look at this, I already got preparation."
<es>

@83
<en>Miya put down a slim paccel he carried on his shoulder. He opens it and I saw a Japanese sword in there.
<es>

@84
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wha-what is it?"
<es>

@88
<en>{Amamiya}\n"This is a noted sword passed down from generation to generation. I know I don't look I was practicing a swordmanship when I was young. But it was only at a school, though."
<es>

@90
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Big thrill...."
<es>

@91
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I can kill anything with this."
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure you can."
<es>

@93
<en>I know even first-timer can do that with it. Oh, no.....If I say I fucked with Natsume, he'll kill me with that sword.
<es>

@94
<en>I know Miya could kill me without hesitation with his fathery attitude he regained.
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I can help caryying your stuff."
<es>

@96
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, thank you."
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can carry that, too."
<es>

@98
<en>I reach out my hand to the sword with a straight face.
<es>

@101
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, I carry this by myself."
<es>

@102
<en>Shoot! He took it first.
<es>

@103
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you ready now?"
<es>

@108
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh, Kazushi."
<es>

@109
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, Natsume, good timing."
<es>

@114
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hey, Natsume. Did you know your dad will work at a purchasing department?"
<es>

@117
<en>{Natsume}\n"Really..?"
<es>

@118
<en>Natsume made a disgusted face.
<es>

@121
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Wha-why do you make the face?Don't you like your dad work at your school?"
<es>

@122
<en>{Natsume}\n"I feel embarrassed when I see my parent at my school."
<es>

@123
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah, I know what you mean."
<es>

@124
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, come on..."
<es>

@127
<en>{Natsume}\n"You got to be invisible for me somewhere at the corner from tomorrow. Okay?"
<es>

@130
<en>{Amamiya}\n"O-okay..."
<es>

@131
<en>I know he came here all the way to protect Natsume. How sad to be a father.How
<es>

@132
<en>I wonder if my dad can be nice like him if I was a girl.
<es>

@133
<en>I know my dad used to buy something to my sister secretly. I wish I was born as a girl.
<es>

@137
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder what Natsume is supposed to buy here."
<es>

@140
<en>{Natsume}\n"I came here to buy the school stuff from tomorrow."
<es>

@141
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@142
<en>Finally, Natsume will start a school. Well, it's gonna be fun.
<es>

@147
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Well, I can buy the stuff you need as a gift. It's gonna be a present from me for your admission. Do they sell school bag here?"
<es>

@148
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think they have the shool bag you talk about because this is not an elementary school."
<es>

@151
<en>{Natsume}\n"This guy had been gone when I needed the school bag. I think his time must have stopped since then."
<es>

@154
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Tell me anything you want from this store. Well, I'm not really rich, but I can give you whatever you want as a gift."
<es>

@155
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You still have to pay, though."
<es>

@156
<en>He is a kind of father who's trying to do a favor for his daughter even he abuses his authority.
<es>

@159
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't want anything, so can you leave now?"
<es>

@162
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What? You feel embarrassing if I'm with you. Why is that?"
<es>

@165
<en>{Natsume}\n"Don't worry about it, just go! Can you pay more attetion here and leave me alone with Kazushi?"
<es>

@166
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Wha-what do you think you are going to do with him?"
<es>

@169
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's nothing wrong to be alone if they are lovers, isn't it?"
<es>

@170
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, Natsume..."
<es>

@173
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You go together....?"
<es>

@174
<en>Oh, no...Miya puts his hand on a sword.
<es>

@175
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I never knew about you, guys. It must be a misunderstanding."
<es>

@176
<en>La-laughing, and being angry...! I didn't know it's possible to do two things at the same time...!
<es>

@179
<en>{Natsume}\n"Is that right? Kazushi has crushed on me, so I gave him a chance to go together with me."
<es>

@180
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? I never knew."
<es>

@184
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hm...I see~. Kazushi likes Natsume ...? I think Kazushi got carried away a little bit."
<es>

@185
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't!"
<es>

@186
<en>FWAP!
<es>

@187
<en>He loosened a sword for immediate use.
<es>

@188
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um...Well...."
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Could you please give me a chance to date with your daughter"
<es>

@191
<en>He bows at his feet and finds a way out with sincerity.
<es>

@192
<en>Wha-what?
<es>

@195
<en>{Amamiya}\n"No way!!"
<es>

@197
<en>THUDDA!!
<es>

@198
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh...."
<es>

@199
<en>I lifted my head since I felt the wind blast, then I saw his sword crossed in front of my face.
<es>

@200
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, shit!"
<es>

@201
<en>He's like an ogre carrying the title of father.
<es>

@205
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi! Run now!"
<es>

@207
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Aaaaaah!!"
<es>

@209
<en>He dashed away as soon as Natsume said.
<es>

@212
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Wait!!!"
<es>

@216
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Worrrh!"
<es>

@217
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh, no, Kazushi!"
<es>

@218
<en>That's how the summer holiday became over.
<es>

@221
<en>A new semester has started.
<es>

@226
<en>{Natsume}\n"What do you mean we are in the diffrent class?"
<es>

@227
<en>Natsume doesn't waste time in getting angry in the new school year. She turns into a scowl, throwing negative aura around her.
<es>

@228
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What can you do that we are in a different grade?"
<es>

@231
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes, we can do something. You give up things too soon, that's why your deviation value is low."
<es>

@232
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't talk about that. It's nothing to with deviation value."
<es>

@237
<en>{Haruka}\n"Take it easy, guys."
<es>

@240
<en>{Natsume}\n"How can I take it easy in this situation? Who should I go to for complaining?"
<es>

@241
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know."
<es>

@242
<en>{Haruka}\n"I think you should go to my grandma."
<es>

@243
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh, Hisae."
<es>

@244
<en>Natsume took a piece of paper from her pocket after thinking for a while. It looks like a flyer from a store.
<es>

@247
<en>{Haruka}\n"Do you use it for a scribble?"
<es>

@250
<en>{Natsume}\n"I know you don't want to waste a paper."
<es>

@251
<en>She scribbles on the back of flyer, acting like a petit bourgeois.
<es>

@252
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you do with it?"
<es>

@255
<en>{Natsume}\n"Watch."
<es>

@256
<en>SCRIBBLE....
<es>

@257
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you writing? 'Hisae, dead...' What?!"
<es>

@260
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hahaha....Are you going to kill my grandma?"
<es>

@261
<en>Haruka who just saw a death notice of her family member gave a ironical laugh.
<es>

@262
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not funny."
<es>

@265
<en>{Haruka}\n"Because..."
<es>

@268
<en>{Natsume}\n"Look. I cut this as a shape of monster and give a drop of my blood, then you'll see a moster that can kill Hisae."
<es>

@269
<en>What an awful thing to think...
<es>

@270
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can't do that. Is it alchemy?"
<es>

@273
<en>{Haruka}\n"Alchemy doesn't do that kind of thing. You must be joking, right? It's rather magic, I think."
<es>

@276
<en>{Natsume}\n"Do you know who I am? I am not an ordinary alchemist."
<es>

@279
<en>{Natsume}\n"The misterious stone you've been looking for exsists inside me. Because my blood itself is a mystery of quest for alchemist."
<es>

@282
<en>{Haruka}\n"You sound right. You are awsome, Natsume."
<es>

@283
<en>That's right. I can say Natsume is known for a top alchemist in the world.
<es>

@284
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But you're not saying a piece of paper turns into a monster, are you?"
<es>

@285
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes, I'm talking seriously. It comes out of Natsume's space-time."
<es>

@286
<en>{Haruka}\n"Natsume's space-time?"
<es>

@287
<en>{Natsume}\n"Natsume's space-time means my pocket. Anyway, after the monster eats up Hisae, I can have the same class with Kazushi."
<es>

@288
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hold on! Wait a second!"
<es>

@289
<en>I stop her in a rush. I wish I could see a real monster coming out, but if it happens in real, it's gonna be too chaos.
<es>

@292
<en>{Haruka}\n"I bet you will have good friends in the first grade. So, why don't you give it a try?"
<es>

@293
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's right. You got to challenge a new environment."
<es>

@296
<en>{Natsume}\n"First graders are very childish to me. I'm sure I'll get bored with them."
<es>

@297
<en>Well, Natsume is very immature, too. But I won't say that to her because she may get cross at me again.
<es>

@298
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why don't you go and check inside the classroom? And if you still don't like it, we'll think from there. Don't dislike without even having tried it yet."
<es>

@301
<en>{Natsume}\n"O-okay. I try once and if I don't like it, I won't do that again."
<es>

@302
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, we'll think about it if that happens. Come over to the caffeteria at lunch time and let me know how it goes."
<es>

@303
<en>{Natsume}\n"Okay."
<es>

@307
<en>{Kazushi}\n"In ten minutes."
<es>

@308
<en>There is another ten minutes to go until lunch time. I think I keep watching the clock since this morning.
<es>

@311
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Are you worried about Natsume? I think it's overprotection for her."
<es>

@312
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't worry about Natsume, I worry about the monster going crazy in her classroom."
<es>

@315
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What do you mean?"
<es>

@316
<en>Natsume has very clear-cut personarity, so I wonder she can get along with everybody in the class....I hope nobody would bully her.
<es>

@317
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nine minutes to go...Is that clock keeping correct time?"
<es>

@320
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I think it is correct. Only one minute ahead...Come on, if you are a man, settle down."
<es>

@321
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know, but..."
<es>

@323
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hm?"
<es>

@326
<en>I hear loud noise coming from the hallway.
<es>

@327
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@331
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Who's running there? It is still in the middle of class."
<es>

<en>CLOMP-CLOMP-CLOMP!
<es>

@334
<en>The footsteps sound coming closer.
<es>

@335
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!"
<es>

@336
<en>I heard the person who's running around in the hallway. The person is calling my name.
<es>

@339
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Yoo-Hoo, Kazushi!"
<es>

@340
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry about that."
<es>

@341

<es>

@351
<en>Swinging a parcel of paper napkings in Natsume's hand, she rushed inside the classroom barefacedly.
<es>

@366
<en>{Lower-grade girl 1}\n"Hey, Natsume!"
<es>

@367
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hm?"
<es>

@368
<en>When I look carefully, there are two girls calling Natsume. I wonder they are Natsume's classmates, but look younger than their age.
<es>

@369
<en>They seem they want to come in and stop Natsume from interrupting the class but they are stranded at the door way.
<es>

@370

<es>

@375
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's okay, because this is Kazushi's class."
<es>

<es>

@380
<en>{Pierre}\n"She meant Kazushi would take responsibility for this mess."
<es>

@381
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're joking me. Is that what she meant?"
<es>

@385
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Yeah, I can say so. You come to a faculty office later, Kazushi."
<es>

@386

@511

@516
<en>Finally, the first day of school is over.
<es>

@517

<es>

@518

<es>

@524
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, I'm glad you made some friends."
<es>

@525
<en>I worried about her, but I guess she gets along with the class and grabs the interest of kids in her grade as well as seniors.
<es>

@528
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't know I can call them friends."
<es>

@529
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They are your friends, aren't they? You should remember their names quickly."
<es>

@532
<en>{Natsume}\n"I already knew their names. Hanako and Kaoruko Tanaka."
<es>

@533
<en>For your information, their real names areYae Shimura, and Chicako Suzuki. I'm amazed they are totally different.
<es>

@536
<en>{Natsume}\n"The first grade class was not bad as I thought."
<es>

@537

<es>

@544

<es>

@545
<en>Suddenly, Natsume looked at the sky.
<es>

@546
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's that?"
<es>

@547
<en>{Natsume}\n"The wind stopped."
<es>

@548
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wind?"
<es>

@549
<en>I noticed when she said that. Because the wind used to blow Natsume's hair untill now has gone all of a sudden.
<es>

@551
<en>I start feeling the humid heat in the air that irritates me with my skin sweating.
<es>

@552
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is this smell?"
<es>

@553
<en>There is sweet aroma emitting in the air. That is like a rotten fruit, giving out the luscious scent.
<es>

@554
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think it's because of fall. Well, it may be a liitle bit early to call fall..."
<es>

@557
<en>{Natsume}\n"......................."
<es>

@558
<en>Natsume didn't say anything but looking up at the blue sky of the late summer.
<es>

@563
<en>I haven't realized yet that the color of the sky is very similar that I've seen somewhere else before.
<es>

@564
<en>I had a hard time to go sleep that night.
<es>

@565
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know why I can't go sleep. I'm usually a fast sleeper."
<es>

@566
<en>I was known for a fast sleeper, but I suffer insomnia now. What a promotion I got....
<es>

@567
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know I shouldn't try to sleep forcefully."
<es>

@568
<en>I think I should try taking a walk. It looks nice with breeze outside.
<es>

@572
<en>It was so nice out here. It feels like autumn winds.
<es>

@573
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's already September, isn't it?"
<es>

@574
<en>This summer has passed so quick. I know every summer goes by quickly, but I felt this summer went super fast to me.
<es>

@575
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hm?"
<es>

@580
<en>Oh, Natsume. What is she doing alone?
<es>

@581
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hm?"
<es>

@582
<en>I threw a question at myself. I remember I met Natsume at midnight before like this.
<es>

@583
<en>But, that was only in my dream.
<es>

@584
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder I'm dreaming now."
<es>

@585
<en>And also, the air quality seems to be the same. Suffocatigly sweet aroma...like scent of flower.
<es>

@586
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I hope Natsume is still in real, not in my dream."
<es>

@589
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hm?"
<es>

@590
<en>I think she noticed my voice.
<es>

@591
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi."
<es>

@594
<en>Natsume rushed over me and held my hand as a child needed hand in hand with an adult.
<es>

@595
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you doing alone in this late? I hope this is not a dream."
<es>

@598
<en>{Natsume}\n"No, this is real."
<es>

@599
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see."
<es>

@600
<en>I was relieved.
<es>

@601
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I got flustered when I thought that you went back to the other world again."
<es>

@604
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm here. But..."
<es>

@605
<en>I look up at the sky, wondering where this sweet aroma coming from.
<es>

@608
<en>{Natsume}\n"........"
<es>

@609
<en>Natsume keeps looking at the night sky without a move. And her palm is getting sweaty in my hand for a change, since she doesn't usually sweat much.
<es>

@610
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@613
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't know I should stay here."
<es>

@614
<en>She mumbled to herself. I start worrying about her after fleeting relief.
<es>

@615
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's going on with you?"
<es>

@618
<en>{Natsume}\n"Nothing, really..."
<es>

@619
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure?"
<es>

@622
<en>{Natsume}\n"........"
<es>

@623
<en>She looks in trouble with something. I want to know what's going on with her.
<es>

@624
<en>{Natsume}\n"I wish I could ride your bicycle again."
<es>

@625
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? My bicycle?"
<es>

@628
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hm..."
<es>

@629
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, you can have that anytime you want. Do you wanna ride this weekend?"
<es>

@632
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah."
<es>

@633
<en>But somehow, she sounds the blues. She seems worrying about something. I can't feel happy even I promised her a date.
<es>

@634
<en>What's going on? It must be this sweet aroma causing it.This really stirs emotions.
<es>

@637
<en>Thank for that aroma, I forgot to give her a goodnight kiss.
<es>

@643
<en>RUSTLE!
<es>

@644
<en>A dark shadow passing by through the woods in the deep dark of night. It goes faster in my eyes even in the darkness.
<es>

@645
<en>The shadow is not big, rather a smaller silhoutte. The gray hair standing out in the darkness...
<es>

@648
<en>That is Hisae.
<es>

@650
<en>{Principal}\n"Hm..."
<es>

@651
<en>I din't know when she came to stop, but she did before I knew it. She looked underneath her feet and looked around her.
<es>

@652
<en>She seems checking something.
<es>

@655
<en>{Principal}\n"......."
<es>

@656
<en>Satisfied with the spot, Hisae dropped something down there. A white flower standing out in the darkness.
<es>

@658
<en>Walking around the woods, Hisae plants flowers here and there. And if they bloom, that would make a whole circle around the woods.
<es>

@659
<en>Basically, it's going to encircle the Eiden School towering up on the summit.
<es>

@660
<en>An ordinary people can't see the boundary which Hisae made by casting a spell of alchemy. That is for drawing a border inside and outside of the school.
<es>

@661
<en>When it intersects with the begining of the border and the end, it will close it as a full cirlcle.
<es>

@666
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I can't."
<es>

@668
<en>I get up kicking off the blanket. I couldn't sleep with this humid air. I look at the time.
<es>

@669
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's still three in the morining."
<es>

@670
<en>It's an odd time, not the morning yet, and not at night any more...
<es>

@671
<en>{Appo-}\n"ZZZZZ~~~~"
<es>

@672
<en>Appo- has been snoring all night. I can tell he feels hot because his blanket is also kicked out far away and his tummy is uncovered.
<es>

@673
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why is so hot?"
<es>

@674
<en>Why does it have to be this humid even when the middle of autumn is near?
<es>

@675
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I don't hear any bugs tonight."
<es>

@676
<en>I remember Natsume said it was tunnel of bugs the other night. But, so quiet tonight.
<es>

@677
<en>This quietness could be one of the reasons why I can't sleep.
<es>

@678
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What could it be?"
<es>

@682
<en>I went ouside impatiently. When I feel breeze, it's still bearable, but without it, it is outrageously humid.
<es>

@683
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think it's real, right?"
<es>

@684
<en>I doubt I might be in a dream because I feel this is out of touch of the reality.
<es>

@685
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It could be only my imagination."
<es>

@686
<en>I know Appo-'s sleeping in the room. If you are talking about that world, it should be only Natsume, but that Natsume isn't there any more.
<es>

@687
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah, Natsume."
<es>

@688
<en>I worried about Natsume. I have a bad feeling just becauase I didn't give her a goodnight kiss tonight.
<es>

@689
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think I should go and check with a girl's dorm."
<es>

@694

<es>

@695

<es>

@696

<es>

@705
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You're not goning inside Natsume's room, are you?"
<es>

@706
<en>This is another side of Amamiya, let's call this side B. He glares at me filled with paternal love which freaks me out.
<es>

@707
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no. Not at all."
<es>

@708
<en>I shook my head as hard as I could for denial.
<es>

@709
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, to be honest, I worry about Natsume sincerely."
<es>

@712
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Are you, too?"
<es>

@713
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I guess you are, too, Miya?"

@716
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I don't know why I have a bad feeling about her."
<es>

@717
<en>He strokes his chest as if he could rid of his frustration by doing that.
<es>

@720
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I thought I was too nervous about it, but if you feel the same way I do, it must be something wrong."
<es>

@721
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you mean anything happened to Natsume?"
<es>

@722
<en>Miya looked up at girl's dorm anxiously.

<en>KNOCK-KNOCK
<es>

@729
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume~, Natsume~"
<es>

@730
<en>I called her quietly. I don't feel anything bad happening in this quietness.
<es>

@733
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume, are you sleeping?"
<es>

@734
<en>We keep calling her, there is no answer.
<es>

@735

<es>

@738
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Okay."
<es>

@739

<es>

@743
<en>Going inside.
<es>

@746

<es>

@747

<es>

@748
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume uses the top bunk."
<es>

@751
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Okay.... But, how do you know that?"
<es>

@752
<en>The eyes gleams in the darkness as an evil eye.
<es>

@753
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, because she told me."
<es>

@756
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, I see....I guess I'm too nervous."
<es>

@757
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I understand your situation. Anyway, she is not here."
<es>

@758
<en>She wasn't at the top bunk, either. This room is completely empty.
<es>

@761
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I think she used the bed tonight. That means she was asleep, but she got up and left for somewhere."
<es>

@762
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where did she go in this late."
<es>

@763
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I don't know. She may be outside for getting fresh air."

<es>

@765

<es>

@766

<es>

@767

<es>

@772
<en>{Rei}\n"It's fire! Fire!"
<es>

@775
<en>It's Andou's voice. With the voice, there is sudden commotion going outside the room.
<es>

@776
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Fire?"
<es>

@777
<en>I smell something burnt, wondiring where it comes from?
<es>

@780
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Kazushi, let's go outside."
<es>

@781
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure!"
<es>

@785
<en>There was full of dark smoke out here. What a heat. It feels I'm in a steamed sauna.
<es>

@786
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It was nothing happening a little while ago."
<es>

@787
<en>It means flame must be spreadking quickly. I don't have a good view with dark smoke, but I can see flickering flame behind the smoke.
<es>

@790

@929

<es>

@930
<en>The woods are in raging flame, I feel burning heat just standing here.
<es>

@931
<en>I found a small figure behind the flame.
<es>

@934
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae ..."
<es>

@935
<en>It was Hisae, not Natsume. When I call her quietly, the small figure turns around.
<es>

@940
<en>{Principal}\n"Are you Miya?"
<es>

@941
<en>On the contrary to Amamiya's expectation, Hisae was in her right mind.
<es>

@942
<en>Although I thought she became out of her mind and started fire in the woods, but she looks too calm, which makes me rather terrifying.
<es>

@943
<en>I don't think Amamiya can understand that even she looks fine, but she uses the entire school as a giant fire pit.
<es>

@944
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae , please, don't do that."
<es>

@945
<en>It's not too late at this point. If she puts out the fire and stops refining, we're going to be okay, but if she keeps going...

<es>

@951

<es>

@952
<en>Amamiya got nervous when he heard Natsume's name suddenly.
<es>

@953
<en>{Principal}\n"The thing she swallowed wasn't completed, but it immersed into her body thoroughly, and she almost sucked in by the power of the stone."
<es>

@956
<en>{Principal}\n"Like father, like son...She definitely succeeded the Amamiya's alchemist's blood."
<es>

<es>

@960

<es>

@961
<en>I felt like my hair standing on end, feeling my body flushed.
<es>

@964
<en>{Principal}\n"She is a living mystery. Every power she has is under her control. But the stone hasn't completed yet, that's what's about now."
<es>

@965

<es>

@966
<en>The edge of her mouth goes up which is kinda smile when she is positve.

@967
<en>This burning forest is a fire-pit for refining. The school as a vessel is a flask as a philosophor's egg.
<es>

@968
<en>The thing that should be refined is a mysterious stone inside Natsume.
<es>

@969
<en>Is she trying to refine a mysterious stone furthermore, even it was in the middle of it?
<es>

@970

<es>

@973

<es>

@974
<en>The balance between Natsume and the stone seems perfect.
<es>

@975
<en>But, once they get unbalanced, we don't know what would happen then.
<es>

@978
<en>{Principal}\n"We will know what's gonna happen if she tries, otherwise nothing will happen for sure."

@981

@982

@983

<es>

@986

<es>

@987

@988
<en>{Principal}\n"If you say it's not human's whereabout, then, what about if I do more than we can do?"
<es>

@989

<es>

@993

@996

<es>

@1024
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's go back once."
<es>

@1028
<en>As soon as we got out, I felt stifling hot air. The dark smoke turned into white, giving a hazy view all over.
<es>

@1031
<en>{Appo-}\n"Whoa....The heat is unblievable."
<es>

@1032
<en>The smell of hot air and burning smoke. Actually, there is another kind of smell which is different from either of them.
<es>

@1035
<en>{Appo-}\n"Hm....What is this smell?"
<es>

@1036

@1038

@1042
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why do you have to bring it up now?"

@1045
<en>{Appo-}\n"Well, because Hu-sen is on .....now"

@1046
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't say it....I don't care."
<es>

@1049
<en>{Appo-}\n"C'mon....well, I guess nobody is here."
<es>

@1050
<en>I look around again. There was too much commotion going on a little while ago, but now it is so quiet without seeing even one person.
<es>

@1051

<es>

@1077
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."

@1079
<en>I wonder if the flame making the night sky red. The darkness of night sky looks red with full of blood.

@1094
<en>{Principal}\n"Oww..."
<es>

@1097
<en>Amamiya dashed himself against Hisae, and she crushed down with her back on the ground. Then, Amamiya stepped over her body quickly.

@1101
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It's all over! You 'd better put out the fire in the pit."
<es>

@1102
<en>Amamiya made it this time. But I saw Hisae giving a grin.
<es>

@1106
<en>{Principal}\n"I think it is a little too late for that."

<es>

@1114
<en>{Principal}\n"It is called rubify."
<es>

@1115
<en>Rubify is the term of alchemy, which is the last stage of procedure. That tells you how far Hisae's refining went through.

@1139
<en>She stood up and started walking with her gleaming eyes looking straight up into the airs.
<es>

@1146
<en>I didn't see because it was too quick. No, I could've noticed it soon. How can I misjudge that figure?

@1172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Appo-....!"
<es>

@1173
<en>I couldn't bring a word in terror. At the same time, I can't move my body, feelling numbness. What's the hell going on now?

<es>

@1194
<en>Natsume points her sword at me with her body.
<es>

@1196

<es>

@1198
<en>SHOOOOM!
<es>

@1199
<en>I feel something sticking through my heart. Then, something small and soft crushed into my chest.

@1207

<es>

@1210
<en>{Natsume}\n"Uh...?"
<es>

@1211

<es>

@1212

@1213
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If you try to believe not hurting, you won't feel you are in pain."

<es>

@1219
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If you really wanted to kill me, you shouldn't have made that painful face. That's why I found out that you didn't want to do an evil thing to me."

@1222
<en>{Natsume}\n"To be honest....it's too hard to kill you even in my dream, Kazushi."
<es>

@1223
<en>That's right. This is only a dream. I've been feeling something is not right. No wonder it could happen only in the dream.
<es>

@1224

<es>

@1225
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's the hell going on here?"
<es>

@1232
<en>{Natsume}\n"The school property is tremendously overlapped with the world down there. There is a big-scale breeding going on worldwide."

<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, this place is same with there?"

@1239
<en>When I look around, Appo-'s head is gone. I hope he really didn't die.

<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, it was dangerous way to handle. I wish she could've done a little gentler."
<es>

@1252
<en>Well, it is exacly like Natsume.
<es>

@1255
<en>{Natsume}\n"You needed to feel as if you were really dead, otherwise you wouldn't get awakening from inside you without that kind of shock treatment."

<es>

@1267
<en>As I told you there is no such a thing as a death in here.

@1292
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Principal!"
<es>

@1293
<en>The principal is wobbling over toward us and stares straight at Natsume.
<es>

@1294
<en>{Principal}\n"How did you come to yourself? Why hasn't a stone in you growing yet?"
<es>

@1299
<en>{Natsume}\n"That's what it is the refining for. But, unfortunately, this stone is the different one that Hisae made."
<es>

@1300
<en>{Principal}\n"What did you say?"
<es>

@1303
<en>{Natsume}\n"I have Kazushi's blood inside me, and we built it together.Besides, he already gave me a wound."
<es>

@1304
<en>I felt happy when Natsume smiled at me. I guess I helped her even a little.
<es>

@1305
<en>{Principal}\n"That's a bullshit."
<es>

@1306
<en>The principal is glaring at Natsume and me, feeling enormous hatred she throws toward us.
<es>

@1310
<en>{Natsume}\n"Do you hate me? I always hated you."
<es>

@1311
<en>{Natsume}\n"I didn't like you since when you visited us to see my dad when I was a little. I felt you would take my dad away from me someday."
<es>

@1312
<en>It could be a female's intuition. After all, it happened exactly what Natsume was feared of.
<es>

@1313
<en>Because Miya had to come to this island, leaving Natsume alone at home.
<es>

@1316
<en>{Natsume}\n"But the situation has changed. I feel sorry for Hisae."
<es>

@1321
<en>{Principal}\n"What did you say?"
<es>

@1322
<en>The pricipal gets angry with what I said. It must've been a huge humiliation for her.
<es>

@1325
<en>{Natsume}\n"She always blames on herself with a compelling reason. That's why I feel sorry for her."
<es>

@1326
<en>{Principal}\n"Don't talk to me like that."
<es>

@1327
<en>The principal looks very upset. I really didn't get what Natsume meant. But, I see the principal is agitated by that.
<es>

@1330
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's so sad. I realized what's happening to her since I met Kazushi. I think she needs to go back there, too."
<es>

@1331
<en>Natsume raises her sword.
<es>

@1335
<en>{Principal}\n"Uh...?"
<es>

@1336
<en>The principal uttered pitifully in front of a bare sword. Without warding off the sword, she closed her eyes offering up her body.
<es>

@1337
<en>{Natsume}\n"See you later..."
<es>

@1343
<en>She cut down with her sword. The principal fell down and vanished away like being absorbed into the earth.
<es>

@1346
<en>{Natsume}\n"You are the last one to go, Kazushi."
<es>

@1347
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, you, too. I won't go home without you."
<es>

@1350
<en>{Natsume}\n"Don't talk nonsense....."
<es>

@1354
<en>Just then, the place is lightened up. The color of sky is changing rapidly from red to fresh blue.
<es>

@1355
<en>The sky is clearing up all of a sudden.
<es>

@1358
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@1362
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is..."
<es>

@1363
<en>It is filled with blooming white flowers with quietness. There is no more sound of blazing fire.
<es>

@1366
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh, no...It has replaced completely."
<es>

@1367
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Replaced...? You mean this is the other world?"
<es>

@1368
<en>The place Natsume and I met at the first time. There is no concept of time. We are closed in completely.
<es>

@1375
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hm...huh?"
<es>

@1376
<en>Amamiya has sprung to his feet and checks his body. But there is no cut slashed by Hisae.
<es>

@1377
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Was it a dream?"
<es>

@1378
<en>Everybody usually think it's a dream, but something is not right. I don't know why I sleep here.
<es>

@1379
<en>{Principal}\n"Hm..."
<es>

@1380
<en>He noticed Hisae next to him.
<es>

@1383
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae?"
<es>

@1384
<en>I called her out, then Hisae opened her eyes.
<es>

@1389
<en>{Principal}\n"Where am I?"
<es>

@1390
<en>She looks around as if she just woke up from the dream. She took a deep sigh, understanding the situation around her.
<es>

@1391
<en>{Principal}\n"I guess I was saved luckily."
<es>

@1392
<en>Then, she reallized that Natsume's real reason for her action was to save her.
<es>

@1393
<en>I was hoping I can get closer to him.
<es>

@1396
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Where is Natsume? Where are they?"
<es>

@1397
<en>Amamiya looks for his daughter. But, no where he can see her.
<es>

@1398
<en>{Principal}\n"I think they are still over there. They must be locked in by now."
<es>

@1401
<en>{Amamiya}\n"No way!!"
<es>

@1402
<en>He is in despair. I failed to save her once again.
<es>

@1406
<en>{Amamiya}\n"No, I'm not done yet."
<es>

@1407
<en>If I give up a hope on her, it would become the same result like before. I promised to Kazushi that I would be a good father for Natsume.
<es>

@1408
<en>I know I can do something else for saving her.
<es>

@1413
<en>We are just standing. That would be a perfect world for a alchemist, besides it is closed in, whick makes it more ideal.
<es>

@1416
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@1417
<en>Natsume gave a grunt, and dropped her rear end on the grass. She keeps sitting still in girl's way.
<es>

@1418
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wlhat happened? Do you hurt somewhere?"
<es>

@1421
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi, I'm sorry."
<es>

@1422
<en>I was puzzled when she suddenly apologized to me because she never did that to me before.
<es>

@1423
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wlhat'wrong? Why did you apologize to me?"
<es>

@1424
<en>{Natsume}\n"I can't send you home with my power any more. I was taken over completely."
<es>

@1425
<en>That's what she has been thinking.
<es>

@1426
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you worry about the thing? It's not your fault, is it?"
<es>

@1429
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes, it's my fault."
<es>

@1430
<en>Natsume droops her head with sadness. I don't think I never saw Natsume feeling down like this before.
<es>

@1431
<en>{Natsume}\n"I could've sent you away as I did to Hisae, but I couldn't do that to you."
<es>

@1432
<en>{Natsume}\n"As a result, I brought you into this chaos."
<es>

@1433
<en>Natsume twisting her mouth tries to endure something. Her lips are trembling, harder and harder.
<es>

@1435
<en>{Natsume}\n"Pwww....www..."
<es>

@1436
<en>She couldn't bear it any longer and starts making guttural voice.
<es>

@1437
<en>{Natsume}\n"I know it's my fault you couldn't go back."
<es>

@1438
<en>Glaring at me, Natsume starts shedding tears.
<es>

@1439
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume..."
<es>

@1440
<en>Natsume is crying. I don't know what to say to her, feeling very upset.
<es>

@1441
<en>{Natsume}\n"I could've sent you away if I wanted, but I had a tremendous hesitation until the last moment."
<es>

@1442
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Because you were thinking about me, right?"
<es>

@1443
<en>She knew I wouldn't die in real, but she hesitated to kill me with a sword.
<es>

@1444
<en>{Natsume}\n"No, it's not that...."
<es>

@1445
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Wrong?"
<es>

@1448
<en>{Natsume}\n"Actually, I was afraid to be alone again....If you go, I will have nobody, so I just wanted to keep you no matter what."
<es>

@1449
<en>Her twisting lips go further down and her face is messed up with tears.
<es>

@1450
<en>{Natsume}\n"I wanted to be with you, Kazushi. When I thought about separating from you, I just couldn't deal with it."
<es>

@1451
<en>{Natsume}\n"I was ready for being alone when my mom had died. If I didn't know you, I would be probably fine to be alone."
<es>

@1453
<en>{Natsume}\n"I could bear that before, but not now. I guess I've become a person who can't stand being alone since I met you. So, you should stay with me forever to make it up for me...."
<es>

@1455
<en>Her small frame is shuddering bigger. I wonder what this kid is afraid of, and enduring for.
<es>

@1456
<en>{Natsume}\n"You are always with me..."
<es>

@1457
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure"
<es>

@1458
<en>{Natsume}\n"Um...?"
<es>

@1459
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will be with you all the time. Actually, I will ask you to stay with me."
<es>

@1460
<en>I thought she knew I would never refuse and leave her...
<es>

@1461
<en>{Natsume}\n"........"
<es>

@1462
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you looking at?"
<es>

@1463
<en>{Natsume}\n"Are you sure you will be with me forever?"
<es>

@1464
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, of course. We are together now."
<es>

@1465
<en>{Natsume}\n"Are you sure it's okay for you?"
<es>

@1466
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course."
<es>

@1467
<en>She nodded in big, then the wave of tears splashe down on her face.
<es>

@1468
<en>{Natsume}\n"Waaaaaaaaaa!!!"
<es>

@1469
<en>Natsume cries aloud with convulsive cry as a little kid, with no embarrassment.
<es>

@1470
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why do you have to cry?"
<es>

@1471
<en>Smiling bitterly, I hold Natsume's small frame as she cried aloud. Then, she flings her arms around me and cries louder. as she cried aloud.
<es>

@1472
<en>{Natsume}\n"Waaaaaaaaaa!!!"
<es>

@1473
<en>She finally broke the ice. I wonder she must have tremendous built up tension in her. How much could she bear with her tiny body?
<es>

@1475
<en>Natsume kept crying as if tear gland was erupted. erupted.
<es>

@1478
<en>{Natsume}\n"Weeeeeeeennnhhh!"
<es>

@1479
<en>Finally, she settle down with only a few convulsive cries.
<es>

@1480
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you feel better?"
<es>

@1481
<en>{Natsume}\n"........."
<es>

@1482
<en>She nods as clinging onto my body. She won't set apart her hands because I can feel her firm grip on my body.
<es>

@1483
<en>I never saw Natsume was this emothinal before.
<es>

@1484
<en>I think she must've held back lots of emothions to herself.
<es>

@1485
<en>She couldn't see her dad for a long time, she got locked in the weird world...she got to bear those things patiently by all herself.
<es>

@1486
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't need to worry about it any more If you want me to be with you forever, I would do so."
<es>

@1487
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, even you don't like it, I would be with you."
<es>

@1488
<en>{Natsume}\n"Really?"
<es>

@1489
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really."
<es>

@1492
<en>{Natsume}\n"If you lie, what would you do? You may regret staying in this place."
<es>

@1493
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I won't reget."
<es>

@1494
<en>{Natsume}\n"You had sent me back once, but I came back again. Here we go again, Deja vu...."
<es>

@1495
<en>She was right. I saved her from this world, but she is back again.
<es>

@1496
<en>But it's not exact same from before.
<es>

@1497
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am here with her this time."
<es>

@1500
<en>Natsume lift her head, and I smiled her who still looks anxious.
<es>

@1501
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you see it's different from before? We are together this time, you're not alone here any more."
<es>

@1502
<en>Right. she is not alone, we are together....that's a big difference.
<es>

@1503
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If she really decided to be with me, I would never let her down in her decision."
<es>

@1506
<en>{Natsume}\n"But, this is it. No way to go back home."
<es>

@1507
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, we will go back."
<es>

@1510
<en>{Natsume}\n"What?"
<es>

@1511
<en>Natsume looks surprised. Because in her mind, she thought she could never go back. But, I never doubt we would go back there.
<es>

@1512
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How dare can I stay in this kind of place for all my life. They say it's a ideal world, but I feel suffocated if I live here."
<es>

@1515
<en>{Natsume}\n"Whatever you say, we can't get out here."
<es>

@1516
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, we can."
<es>

@1519
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wha?....How?"
<es>

@1520
<en>My school grade is not good, and I don't know much about alchemy, so I don't have real smart way to do it.
<es>

@1521
<en>All I can think of is very simple way.
<es>

@1522
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You said it was the world of desire that human had created, didn't you?"
<es>

@1525
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah, I did."
<es>

@1526
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I agree with you."
<es>

@1527

<es>

@1528
<en>The person had a strong desire to make this world, where we are in now.
<es>

@1529
<en>You may be able to obtain whatever you want like a gold or an eternity.
<es>

@1530
<en>I believe you can obtain happiness without those things.
<es>

@1531
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If this is such a world, I don't care less if this world disappear."
<es>

@1534
<en>{Natsume}\n"What?"
<es>

@1535
<en>I hold Natsume's hand, who's in surprise.
<es>

@1536
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's destroy this place and go back where we belong to."
<es>

@1537
<en>{Natsume}\n"Destroy this place?"
<es>

@1538
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who wants this kind of world? Don't you wanna go back?"
<es>

@1539
<en>I look into her face, gripping her hand. I see her quickening will power in her eyes.
<es>

@1542
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah, I want to go back with you."
<es>

@1543
<en>Natsume nods, with determination.
<es>

@1544
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, let's do it."
<es>

@1545
<en>I helped her standing up by pulling her hands.
<es>

@1546
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know everybody's waiting for us."
<es>

@1553
<en>{Natsume}\n"How are you going to destroy this?"
<es>

@1554
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know. Just knock it down."
<es>

@1556
<en>I take a shovel at the garden and hit the wall on the school building repeatedly.
<es>

@1557
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's so hard...!! It doesn't move at all!"
<es>

@1560
<en>{Natsume}\n"I think you're wasting your time by doing that."
<es>

@1561
<en>I feel stinging sensation on my hands. I don't know I can make it in this way.
<es>

@1562
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's the heck? I thought I could do it. Maybe I carried away with my thought."
<es>

@1563
<en>Without careful thought, I believed it would collapse easily.
<es>

@1566
<en>{Natsume}\n"Well...believe yourself, then, you can do it."
<es>

@1567
<en>Her words gave me a great encouragement when I was going to give up.
<es>

@1568
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you think I can do it?"
<es>

@1571
<en>{Natsume}\n"The six sense could sometimes hit the spot. So, if you think you can do it, then it may happen. Trust your instinct."
<es>

@1572
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess you're right. I feel better with your green light."
<es>

@1574
<en>The problem is how we do it. We shouldn't do that only by force because it is the world of alchemy.
<es>

@1575
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can you shoot the fracture beam by using your talent in alchemy?"
<es>

@1578
<en>{Natsume}\n"Who do you think I am? Do you wish I was that kind of girl?"
<es>

@1579
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well.....how about electric shock?"
<es>

@1580
<en>{Natsume}\n"I can't do either of them. Are you masochism?"
<es>

@1581
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know. I could be...."
<es>

@1584
<en>{Natsume}\n"I see...."

@1585

<es>

@1588
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's not that...."
<es>

@1589
<en>Suddenly, she is oneself again.
<es>

@1592
<en>{Natsume}\n"I bet you have a good idea because you seem to get along with this place, Kazushi ."
<es>

@1593
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do I get along with this place?"
<es>

@1594
<en>I didn't know that, but Natsume wants to believe it.
<es>

@1595
<en>{Natsume}\n"Think about that you were always in my dream and in this place. It tells you that you have some kind of connection here."
<es>

@1596
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What kind of connection are you talking about?"
<es>

@1599
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't know."
<es>

@1600
<en>Natsume answered without confidence. I know there is no evidence for that, but I feel something strong about this place.
<es>

@1601
<en>I feel some kind of agitation inside me, but I don't know the cause of it.
<es>

@1605
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@1606
<en>Something lighted up just now. Natsume noticed it as well.
<es>

@1609
<en>{Natsume}\n"I know somebody is doing refining now."
<es>

@1610
<en>Natsume muttered looking around.
<es>

@1611
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Refining? Who could it be?"
<es>

@1612
<en>I guess she is tallking about the original world where we used to belong. She said rifining procedure was a mean of connection from there to this world.
<es>

@1613
<en>That means that world and this world are connected now, does it?
<es>

@1614
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hey, Kazushi!"
<es>

@1615
<en>I heard Natsume's shouting, then I found the reason.
<es>

@1616
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no...that is..."
<es>

@1617
<en>I see the light-column rising at the corner of the island. The light shooting up from the ground reached to the sky.
<es>

@1618
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that what you talked about?"
<es>

@1619
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah, over there. There is interfering edge with other space."
<es>

@1620
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay, let's go."
<es>

@1625
<en>That place was exact underneath of the school.
<es>

@1626
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't know that the kind of thing existed under the school."
<es>

@1629
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi, look over there!"
<es>

@1630
<en>Natsume points behind that space. Even I can feel the tremendous energy from there.
<es>

@1631
<en>I know something must be happening over there. We go and check in a hurry.
<es>

@1632
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no..."
<es>

@1633
<en>We saw something there.
<es>

@1636
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi."
<es>

@1637
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, God."
<es>

@1638
<en>What we see is a tiny stone as the size of an egg. It's not too big, it easily stays on your palm.
<es>

@1639
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is not an ordinary stone, is it?"
<es>

@1640

<es>

@1668
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Yes, thank God that you notieced it. I am speaking to you through the space that interfered with mine by refining. It was kind of all or nothing, but I guess I made it."

@1670
<en>It is an irregular communication that happens only inside the flask to connect two worlds by using the refining.
<es>

@1671
<en>That was not for making something new, but for making connection between two worlds.

@1781
<en>A red stone shining in gold in front of my eyes. This is all I need to break.

@1782

@1783

@1785

<es>

@1786
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh....?"
<es>

@1787

<es>

@1788
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hisae..."
<es>

@1792
<en>{Principal}\n"Do you have a stone with you?"
<es>

@1793
<en>Hisae finally broke the silence and uttered a voice. Before that, she was sitting down at the corner of the room as a dead person.
<es>

@1794
<en>She erects her body all of a sudden and speaks to Kazushi.
<es>

@1799
<en>{Haruka}\n"Are you okay, grandma?"
<es>

@1802
<en>{Principal}\n"I'm fine. Anyway, tell me more about the stone."
<es>

@1803
<en>Hisae seems to concern about the stone in great deal.
<es>

@1804
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes."
<es>

@1805
<en>{Principal}\n"Can you tell me what kind of stone?"
<es>

@1806
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um..."
<es>

@1809
<en>Kazushi tells the characteristics of the stone. Hisae listens to him carefully.
<es>

@1812
<en>{Principal}\n"I see. I know what it is now."
<es>

@1813
<en>Hisae nodded deeply at the same time when Amamiya's face went pale.
<es>

@1819
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Is the stone possible to be one which was stolen from the island long time ago?"
<es>

@1820
<en>{Haruka}\n"Is it the one you've been looking for since then, grandma?"
<es>

@1821
<en>That rings a bell to Amamiya and Haruka. Both of them are surprised.
<es>

@1826
<en>{Principal}\n"Yes, that was supposed to be underneath of the island with that person, which should be inside the black box of alchemy."
<es>

@1827
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Black box?"
<es>

@1828
<en>{Principal}\n"The reason the alchemy was very prosperous in this island because of that stone."
<es>

@1833
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The stone inside Natsume is fabrication of that stone. It is called a reprica and the one you see is an original one."
<es>

@1834
<en>{Natsume}\n"I see, this stone is real."
<es>

@1835
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't know this stone is very special."
<es>

@1836
<en>{Principal}\n"And I think that is the source of power which keeps forming the world there."
<es>

@1837
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That means if I break it, it would disappear. Is it right?"
<es>

@1838
<en>{Natsume}\n"Then, can we go home?"
<es>

@1841
<en>Hisae paused for their question. Because she seemed she didn't know how to answer them.
<es>

@1842
<en>She finally nodded.
<es>

@1845
<en>{Principal}\n"If you could break the stone, the world would probably disappear."
<es>

@1846
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I thought so."
<es>

@1847
<en>{Principal}\n"Even though after you be successful with the attemp, I don't know you could come back here or not."
<es>

@1848
<en>{Principal}\n"I think the chance is high to make it, but also, the danger may come with it."
<es>

@1849
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It is worth to try....actually that's only way left for us."
<es>

@1850
<en>{Principal}\n"That's right."
<es>

@1851
<en>Hisae sounds very sad since they have only one solution left.
<es>

@1856
<en>{Haruka}\n"Are you sure they can break that stone, grandma?"
<es>

@1857
<en>Haruka wanted to make sure of that again, noticing Hisae 's feelings.
<es>

@1858
<en>{Principal}\n".............."
<es>

@1859
<en>Hisae got thoughtful when Haruka said so.
<es>

@1860
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not supposed to break it, isn't it?"
<es>

@1861
<en>{Natsume}\n"Is this stone so important for you?"
<es>

@1866
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae has been looking for that for a long time and she needs the power from it."
<es>

@1871
<en>{Haruka}\n"It is very important for my grandma. It would be great if you can make yourself out without destroying."
<es>

@1872
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really. How am I gonna do it if I don't break it?"
<es>

@1875
<en>Kazushi gets thoughtful. Nobody seems to have an alternative idea, the silence prevailed suddenly.
<es>

@1878
<en>{Principal}\n"Well, you should break the stone."
<es>

@1879
<en>Hisae broke the silence first.
<es>

@1880
<en>{Principal}\n"You breake the stone and come back here."
<es>

@1886
<en>{Haruka}\n"Grandma, are you sure?"
<es>

@1887
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You've been looking for the stone for years, haven't you? For that, you stirred up a great fuss today....."
<es>

@1888
<en>Hisae gives a smile to them who concern about her feelings.
<es>

@1893
<en>{Principal}\n"It doesn't matter any more because it is probably the only way they can come back here."
<es>

@1896
<en>{Principal}\n"Plus, I feel he wants to break the stone to save them."
<es>

@1897
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you really sure you don't mind breaking the stone?"
<es>

@1898
<en>{Principal}\n"Yes. Just do it as much as you want."
<es>

@1899
<en>{Natsume}\n"You can't change your mind later, tough."
<es>

@1902
<en>{Principal}\n"Of course, I won't. Well, the thing I'm not sure is how tough it would be to break."
<es>

@1903
<en>{Principal}\n"Do you think you can do it?"
<es>

@1904
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure, we can."
<es>

@1905
<en>Surprisingly, Kazushi replied with confidence.
<es>

@1906
<en>{Natsume}\n"Do you know you're giving her a rash promise?"
<es>

@1907
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can manage it, that's what I feel."
<es>

@1908
<en>Kazushi sounds like he has confidence. Hisae believed him even she didn't see any base on his words.
<es>

@1910
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, we will start an action now. I think you should halt the fire-pit for a while."
<es>

@1913
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You're right. It may have some influence here. But you should know once we disfunction the fire-pit, we will loose communication."
<es>

@1914
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, I know.We will tallk when we come back there."
<es>

@1915
<en>That was very impressive. I heard Kazushi's determination to come back here.
<es>

@1919
<en>{Appo-}\n"I'll see you after waking up from the nap."
<es>

@1920

@1924
<en>{Principal}\n"Well, take care of the rest, okay?"
<es>

@1925
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure, we will. We will be there and you'll pay whatever you owe to us."
<es>

@1927
<en>Kazushi replied reliably. Hisae gives a slight smile on her face. I think they will do it.
<es>

@1928
<en>I want to blieve that.
<es>

@1930
<en>As soon as our communication has blocked, there came silence.
<es>

@1931
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, let's finish this up quickly and go home."
<es>

@1934
<en>{Natsume}\n"How can you be so confident about this, Kazushi?"
<es>

@1935
<en>Natsume can't figure out why I act with full of confidence. It must look weird for her.
<es>

@1939
<en>{Natsume}\n"You rashed the promise with Hisae, but can you really break it? If you don't know, this is the mysterious stone with the best quality that created by the alchemist."
<es>

@1941
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I didn't know that. No wonder the principal didn't want me to break it."
<es>

@1942
<en>But, I have no choice to do that.Without breaking it, we would never destroy this world.
<es>

@1943
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know I must do it no matter what. This is my final answer."
<es>

@1946
<en>{Natsume}\n"I agree with you. This place feels like a jail, and looks like a person I hate."
<es>

@1947
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A person you hate?"
<es>

@1950
<en>{Natsume}\n"Somehow, this place makes me feel very sad."
<es>

@1951
<en>I know what she wants trying to say. This is very sad place. Maybe that's why I wanted to destroy it.
<es>

@1952
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, are you ready?"
<es>

@1953
<en>We face to the stone at the same time. Natsume holds the Japanese sword before I knew it.
<es>

@1955
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I still don't know who created this."
<es>

@1956
<en>The stone shines as breathing.
<es>

@1959

<es>

@1960
<en>Natsume stares at it carefully.
<es>

@1963
<en>{Natsume}\n"It is beautiful. This must be the piece of work by a famous alchemist. But, why have it been hidden underneath?"
<es>

@1964
<en>Natsume thinks why the stone has so much value, with an amazing look.
<es>

@1965
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't understand why that significant alchemist created sad world like here, not a happy one."
<es>

@1968
<en>{Natsume}\n"It may be a different person who made a stone, and made this sad world."
<es>

@1969
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? Do you think so?"
<es>

@1972
<en>{Natsume}\n"I think so. This stone had made somebody's dream."
<es>

@1973
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@1974
<en>It could make a dream come true. However, why the person wanted to make a sad world?
<es>

@1975
<en>He could be a very sad person like this world.
<es>

@1978
<en>{Natsume}\n"If we utilize this carefully, it could make your dream come true, Kazushi."
<es>

@1979
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No thanks."
<es>

@1980
<en>All I want is to go back where I used to belong with Natsume. If I can get it, I don't care about the stone.
<es>

@1981
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What about you? Why don't you ask the stone to make your dream come true?"
<es>

@1984

<es>

@2003
