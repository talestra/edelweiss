@7
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks for the meal!"
<es>

@10
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ngh... you're fast."
<es>

@11
<en>Natsume-chan put down her chopsticks, muttering in frustration. I won the speed-eating competition.
<es>

@12
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hahaha. You challenged me ten years too early. No, make that a hundred years too early. I'll eat this dessert as my prize."
<es>

@15
<en>Her pudding was mine, now. Natsume-chan glared at me with tearful eyes, but a deal's a deal. I gladly took it.
<es>

@16
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma wasn't fair. You swallowed it without hardly chewing it, didn't you?"
<es>

@17
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't have time to taste it since it was a competition."
<es>

@22
<en>{Rin}\n"Well, I spent a lot of time on it, so I wish you would've at least tasted it."
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, sorry about that. I'll have another one, and I'll enjoy the taste this time."
<es>

@27
<en>{Natsume}\n"How about another round? Please, another round!"
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you kidding me? You don't know when to stop, do you? Okay, I'll beat you head-on again."
<es>

@33
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh, I know he won't taste it again."
<es>

@38
<en>{Mei}\n"Hey, wait a second."
<es>

@39
<en>Mei-sensei was running up to us.
<es>

@40
<en>{Mei}\n"You're done eating, aren't you, Haruma-kun?"
<es>

@41
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Kind of... But we were about to have a second round."
<es>

@44
<en>{Mei}\n"Before you start that, can you go fetch somebody?"
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Somebody?"
<es>

@50
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, Miya-san."
<es>

@53
<en>Miya-san was waiting when I reached the spot Mei-sensei asked me to go to.
<es>

@56
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Thank God! I'm glad it was you picking me up."
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why are you here?"
<es>

@58
<en>There was a huge trunk underneath his feet. He looked like he was moving somewhere.
<es>

@61
<en>{Amamiya}\n"As a matter of fact, I'll be living here starting today."
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you really moving in?"
<es>

@63
<en>No wonder he had a ton of luggage.
<es>

@64
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The director of the school store went on a summer holiday, and he won't come back until the second semester."
<es>

@65
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So you're here as his replacement?"
<es>

@68
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Well, to be honest, that's just an excuse."
<es>

@69
<en>Suddenly, Miya-san made a stern face, and drooped his shoulders. Something must've happened to him.
<es>

@72
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Actually, I had a dream about Natsume, and it wasn't good one."
<es>

@73
<en>Miya-san's face turned even more serious. I wondered how bad it was, and started worrying a little bit.
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What kind of dream did you have?"
<es>

@75
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I hate to even talk about, but in the dream, Natsume was shedding blood."
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh... Blood?"
<es>

@77
<en>At first, I visualized an image like the stain she left on her sheets. I hoped Miya-san's bad premonition wasn't from us...
<es>

@78
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I'm afraid that if something happened to Natsume... I wouldn't be able to let them off easily. Thanks to you, Haruma-kun, I'm ready for anything for her."
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can't let them off? Wh-what do you plan to do?"
<es>

@82
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Look at this, I've already prepared myself."
<es>

@83
<en>Miya-san put down a slim parcel he carried on his shoulder. He opened it, and I saw a katana in there.
<es>

@84
<en>{Kazushi}\n"W-what's that?"
<es>

@87
<en>{Amamiya}\n"This is a noted sword passed down through the generations in my family. I know I don't look it, but I used to practice kendo. It was only at school, though."
<es>

@88
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Th-that's..."
<es>

@89
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I can kill anything with this."
<es>

@90
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure you can."
<es>

@91
<en>I knew what even a first-timer could do that with one of those. Oh, shit. If he finds out I did Natsume-chan, he's gonna kill me!
<es>

@92
<en>I knew Miya-san would kill me without hesitation with the fatherly attitude he regained.
<es>

@93
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh, umm, I should help carry your luggage, right?"
<es>

@94
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, thank you."
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll get that for you."
<es>

@96
<en>I casually reached out my hand to take the sword.
<es>

@99
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Don't worry about this. I'll get it."
<es>

@100
<en>He took it first. I failed.
<es>

@101
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...Then shall we head out?"
<es>

@106
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh, Haruma."
<es>

@107
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, Natsume-chan, good timing."
<es>

@112
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hey, Natsume. Did you know your dad will be working at the school store?"
<es>

@115
<en>{Natsume}\n"...what?"
<es>

@116
<en>Natsume-chan made a disgusted face.
<es>

@119
<en>{Amamiya}\n"W-why are you making a face like that? Don't you want to be with Papa?"
<es>

@120
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's embarrassing to have your parents at school."
<es>

@121
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah, I know what you mean."
<es>

@122
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, come on..."
<es>

@125
<en>{Natsume}\n"Starting tomorrow you make yourself small in the corner and be sure not to stand out."
<es>

@128
<en>{Amamiya}\n"O-okay..."
<es>

@129
<en>I knew he came all the way here to protect Natsume-chan. How sad it is to be a father.
<es>

@130
<en>I wondered if my dad would be nice like him if I was a girl.
<es>

@131
<en>I know my dad used to buy secretly buy gifts for my little sister. I wished I was born a girl.
<es>

@135
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what were you here to pick up, Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@138
<en>{Natsume}\n"I came here to buy my school supplies for tomorrow."
<es>

@139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, right."
<es>

@140
<en>Natsume-chan will finally be starting at our school. Well, it's gonna be fun.
<es>

@145
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Well, I can buy the stuff you'll need for you as a gift. Consider it a late present from me in honor of your admission. Do they sell schoolbags here?"
<es>

@146
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not the kind you're looking for. This isn't an elementary school."
<es>

@149
<en>{Natsume}\n"This guy was gone when I needed my first schoolbag. I think time must have stopped for him since then."
<es>

@152
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Tell me anything you want from the store. Papa's poor, but I can give you whatever you want as a gift."
<es>

@153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You still have to pay, though."
<es>

@154
<en>He was the kind of father who tried doing favors for his daughter, even it meant abusing his authority. It was hard to speak up against his tearful effort.
<es>

@157
<en>{Natsume}\n"That's enough. You're embarrassing, so go away."
<es>

@160
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What? Papa's embarrassing? How?"
<es>

@163
<en>{Natsume}\n"Just go away! Be more considerate, and leave me alone with Haruma."
<es>

@164
<en>{Amamiya}\n"W-what do you think you're going to do with him alone?"
<es>

@167
<en>{Natsume}\n"There's nothing wrong with two lovers being alone together, is there?"
<es>

@168
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, Natsume-chan..."
<es>

@171
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Lovers...?"
<es>

@172
<en>HHHHHH?! Miya-san grabbed the katana!!
<es>

@173
<en>{Amamiya}\n"P-Papa hasn't heard anything about that. This must be a misunderstanding."
<es>

@174
<en>H-he's smiling! He's angry and smiling! I didn't know it was possible to do both!
<es>

@177
<en>{Natsume}\n"You hadn't? Haruma had a crush on me, so I decided to go out with him."
<es>

@178
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Is that how it went?"
<es>

@182
<en>{Amamiya}\n"O-ohh? Haruma-kun likes Natsume, huh? Haruma-kun, aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself?"
<es>

@183
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I-I'm not!"
<es>

@184
<en>SHHHNK!
<es>

@185
<en>H-he just unsheathed his sword!!
<es>

@186
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm, uhh, well..."
<es>

@187
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please let me go out with Natsume-chan!!"
<es>

@189
<en>I bowed at his feet and tried to find a way out with sincerity.
<es>

@190
<en>Wh-what!?
<es>

@193
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I won't permit it!!"
<es>

@195
<en>FWWWM!!
<es>

@196
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh...?!"
<es>

@197
<en>I lifted my head since I felt the wind blast, then saw his sword flash by in front of my face.
<es>

@198
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hhhh?!"
<es>

@199
<en>He was an ogre. He was an ogre named father.
<es>

@203
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma! Run now!"
<es>

@205
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hhhhhah!!"
<es>

@207
<en>I dashed away as soon as Natsume-chan spoke out.
<es>

@210
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Wait!!!"
<es>

@214
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugyaaaaaaahhh!!"
<es>

@215
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ah, Haruma!"
<es>

@216
<en>And that was how our summer holidays came to an end.
<es>

@219
<en>And so the new semester began.
<es>

@224
<en>{Natsume}\n"What do you mean we're in different classes?"
<es>

@225
<en>Natsume-chan didn't waste time getting pissed off during the new term. Her face turned into a scowl, and she threw a negative aura all around her.
<es>

@226
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What can you do? We ARE in a different grades."
<es>

@229
<en>{Natsume}\n"There's gotta be SOMETHING we can do. You give up way too easily, that's why your grades are low."
<es>

@230
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't talk about my grades. They have nothing to do with this problem."
<es>

@235
<en>{Haruka}\n"Take it easy, you guys."
<es>

@238
<en>{Natsume}\n"How can I take it easy in this situation? Who? Who should I go complain to?"
<es>

@239
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know."
<es>

@240
<en>{Haruka}\n"I guess that'd be Grandma."
<es>

@241
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hisae, huh?"
<es>

@242
<en>Natsume-chan took a piece of paper from her skirt pocket after thinking for a while. It looked like a store flyer.
<es>

@245
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh, you're the kind who uses flyers for scrap paper?"
<es>

@248
<en>{Natsume}\n"It'd be a waste of paper to just throw them away."
<es>

@249
<en>She scribbled on the back of flyer as she came out about being lower middle class.
<es>

@250
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you going to do with it?"
<es>

@253
<en>{Natsume}\n"Watch."
<es>

@254
<en>SCRIBBLE...
<es>

@255
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you writing? 'Hisae, die...' What!?"
<es>

@258
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ah, ahaha... A-are you going to kill Grandma?"
<es>

@259
<en>Haruka, who had just seen a death sentence for her family member, let out a dry laugh.
<es>

@260
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not funny."
<es>

@263
<en>{Haruka}\n"Because..."
<es>

@266
<en>{Natsume}\n"Watch. I cut this into the shape of a monster, and give it a drop of my blood. Then you'll see a monster that can devour Hisae."
<es>

@267
<en>What an awful thing to think...
<es>

@268
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can you do that? Is that alchemy too?"
<es>

@271
<en>{Haruka}\n"Alchemy doesn't do that kind of thing. You must be joking, right? It's more like magic, I think."
<es>

@274
<en>{Natsume}\n"Do you know who I am? I'm no ordinary alchemist."
<es>

@277
<en>{Natsume}\n"The mysterious stone you've all been looking for exists inside me. Because my blood itself is the very mystery you alchemists have been seeking."
<es>

@280
<en>{Haruka}\n"Wow, sounds about right. You're awesome, Natsume-chan."
<es>

@281
<en>That's right. I could say Natsume-chan was known as one of the world's top alchemists.
<es>

@282
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But you're not saying a piece of paper could turn into a monster, are you?"
<es>

@283
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes, I seriously mean it. It'll come out of Natsume space-time."
<es>

@284
<en>{Haruka}\n"Natsume space-time?"
<es>

@285
<en>{Natsume}\n"Natsume space-time is a convenient pocket dimension. So, I'll have this monster eat Hisae and then I'll be in the same class as Haruma."
<es>

@286
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, no, no! Hold on!"
<es>

@287
<en>I rushed to stop her. I wished I could see a real monster appear, but it would be too late by the time that happened, so I had to stop her now.
<es>

@290
<en>{Haruka}\n"I bet you'll make some great friends in your freshman class, so why don't you give it a try?"
<es>

@291
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's right. You have to give new things a try."
<es>

@294
<en>{Natsume}\n"Freshmen are childish. Being with them would wear me out."
<es>

@295
<en>Well, Natsume-chan, you're rather childish too...\nBut I wouldn't say that to her face because she'd get cross with me again.
<es>

@296
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why don't you at least go and give it a shot? And if you still don't like it, we'll take it from there. Don't dislike something without even having tried it."
<es>

@299
<en>{Natsume}\n"O-okay. I'll try it once, but if I don't like it, I won't do it again."
<es>

@300
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Come to the cafeteria at lunch time and let me know how it goes."
<es>

@301
<en>{Natsume}\n"...Okay."
<es>

@305
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ten minutes left, huh?"
<es>

@306
<en>There was another ten minutes to go until lunch time. I think I did nothing but watch the clock since that morning.
<es>

@309
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Are you that worried about Natsume-chan? I think you're being overprotective of her."
<es>

@310
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not worried about Natsume-chan. I'm worried about whether or not a monster is rampaging in her classroom."
<es>

@313
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Do what?"
<es>

@314
<en>Natsume-chan was very clear about what she did and didn't like. I hope she's getting along well with her class. I doubt she's being bullied, but...
<es>

@315
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nine minutes to go? Is that clock stopped?"
<es>

@318
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's moving. It's been exactly one minute. Come on, if you're a man, you'll settle down."
<es>

@319
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know, but..."
<es>

@321
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hm?"
<es>

@324
<en>I heard hasty footsteps coming from the hallway.
<es>

@325
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@329
<en>{Yagami}\n"Who's running out there? We're still in the middle of class."
<es>

@331
<en>CLOMP-CLOMP-CLOMP!
<es>

@332
<en>The sound of footsteps came closer.
<es>

@333
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma! Haruma!"
<es>

@334
<en>I heard the person who was running through the corridors. She was calling my name...
<es>

@337
<en>{Yagami}\n"Hey, Kazushi?"
<es>

@338
<en>{Kazushi}\n"S-sorry about that."
<es>

@339
<en>If I sat by the window, I would've jumped out without a second thought. However, I couldn't do that from the center of the classroom.
<es>

@341
<en>I had to suck it up and endure being the focus of my classmates' attention for the moment.
<es>

@344
<en>RATTLE!
<es>

@345
<en>The door opened sooner than I expected. A small-framed girl burst through the entrance.
<es>

@348
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma! Listen! We baked cookies at home economics!!"
<es>

@349
<en>Natsume-chan was swinging a parcel of paper napkins in her hand as she shamelessly rushed inside the classroom.
<es>

@353
<en>{Yagami}\n"Amamiya, look here..."
<es>

@354
<en>Yagami-sensei rubbed his temple. I was getting a headache too.
<es>

@359
<en>{Natsume}\n"My class already finished, ten minutes early."
<es>

@360
<en>{Yagami}\n"And our class is still proceeding on schedule."
<es>

@361
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry about this."
<es>

@364
<en>{Lower-grade girl 1}\n"Hey, Natsume!"
<es>

@365
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hm?"
<es>

@366
<en>When I look carefully, I saw two girls calling for Natsume-chan. I wondered if they were Natsume-chan's classmates, but they looked younger than their age.
<es>

@367
<en>They looked like they wanted to come in and stop Natsume-chan from interrupting our class, but they were stranded at the doorway.
<es>

@368
<en>{Lower-grade girl 2}\n"This is a second year classroom. This isn't good, Natsume."
<es>

@369
<en>{Lower-grade girl 1}\n"Oh, I'm sorry! Sorry for interrupting, guys!"
<es>

@370
<en>They looked like good kids. I mean, I should say they looked normal, rather than good.
<es>

@373
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's okay, because this is Haruma's class."
<es>

@374
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why is it okay if it's my class?"
<es>

@378
<en>{Pierre}\n"Because you'll take responsibility for her?"
<es>

@379
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Is that how it goes?"
<es>

@383
<en>{Yagami}\n"Yes, I would say so. You come to the teachers' room later, Kazushi."
<es>

@384
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um...sure..."
<es>

@385
<en>I guess I'll be late for lunch.
<es>

@389
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, Haruma, this is Hanako and Tanaka Kaoruko."
<es>

@390
<en>{Hanako}\n"You're totally wrong!!"
<es>

@391
<en>As usual, she couldn't remember people's names.
<es>

@392
<en>{Tanaka Kaoruko}\n"Hey, could he be Natsume's boyfriend?"
<es>

@393
<en>{Hanako}\n"What? Really?"
<es>

@394
<en>They kept staring at me without blinking. Their eyes were shaped like shining hearts.
<es>

@397
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yup, he's my servant."
<es>

@398
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm your servant... Really?"
<es>

@401
<en>{Natsume}\n"We've done the dirty too."
<es>

@402
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You do the dirty with your servants?"
<es>

@408
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's not the point to mention."
<es>

@411
<en>{Appo}\n"Did you really do the dirty with Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@412
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oops..."
<es>

@415
<en>When I realized where I was, the entire class was dead quiet. I felt cold stares all over me, especially from the girls.
<es>

@418
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, Natsume-chan, come over here."
<es>

@423
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hm? What is it?"
<es>

@428
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Just come over here. I have something to talk to you about."
<es>

@431
<en>Natsume-chan was taken away by the girls.
<es>

@432
<en>{Natsume}\n"What's going on?"
<es>

@433
<en>It had been about ten seconds since Natsume-chan was surrounded by the girls, and they all lifted their heads in unison.
<es>

@439
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh, Harucchi~!"
<es>

@442
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You fiend! What are you doing to this poor little girl?!"
<es>

@443
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?! She may be small, but she's only a year younger than I am!"
<es>

@446
<en>{Tanaka Kaoruko}\n"We didn't know that Natsume was ahead of us in that kind of thing."
<es>

@447
<en>{Hanako}\n"You're dating your sempai... You must be very mature. How cool."
<es>

@450
<en>{Natsume}\n"Do you think so? Then, why don't you two find somebody in here? Does anybody have any interest in dating these two girls?"
<es>

@456
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yes! Here! Over here!!"
<es>

@457
<en>{Daigo}\n"I-if you wouldn't mind me..."
<es>

@458
<en>{Tanaka Kaoruko}\n"No thank you."
<es>

@465
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You've already been dumped."
<es>

@468
<en>{Ran}\n"I told you, if you pay the membership fee, I'll introduce you to three girls every month."
<es>

@469
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What kind of membership is that?"
<es>

@474
<en>{Yagami}\n"I couldn't care less, but you're all forgetting that we're still in the middle of class."
<es>

@480
<en>{Sakura}\n"It's over, right, sensei?"
<es>

@485
<en>{Yagami}\n"Jeez... I can see all of you are still carrying vacation fever, but you'd better fix that as soon as possible because midterms are just around the corner!"
<es>

@489
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't worry, sensei! I'll give them the copies of my notes for 5000 yen per subject!"
<es>

@495
<en>{Pierre}\n"That sounds really expensive!"
<es>

@496
<en>{Daigo}\n"How about 3000 yen...no...2000 yen!"
<es>

@501
<en>{Yagami}\n"Sounds like Kamoike needs to lower her prices or quite a few are going to fail."
<es>

@505
<en>{Natsume}\n"Second years must be really busy. Anyway, shut up and eat this cookie, Haruma."
<es>

@506
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay, okay."
<es>

@507
<en>Thank god that Natsume-chan joined the school. It looks like we'll have a lot of fun.
<es>

@512
<en>Finally, the first day of class was over.
<es>

@513
<en>When I went to Natsume-chan's classroom to meet her, the girls from this afternoon had already left.
<es>

@514
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did your friends go home already?"
<es>

@517
<en>{Natsume}\n"They told me to say hi to you and went home."
<es>

@518
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess they tried to be considerate."
<es>

@519
<en>My kohai were all trying to give us time. What a bad sempai I am.
<es>

@520
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But I'm glad you made some friends in no time."
<es>

@521
<en>I worried about her, but I guess she got along with her class, and grabbed the interest of the kids in her grade as well as her seniors.
<es>

@524
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't know if I can call them friends."
<es>

@525
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They are your friends, aren't they? You should remember their names soon."
<es>

@528
<en>{Natsume}\n"I already know their names. Hanako and Tanaka Kaoruko."
<es>

@529
<en>For your information, their real names were Shimura Yae, and Suzuki Chikako. I was amazed that they were totally different.
<es>

@532
<en>{Natsume}\n"The freshman class wasn't bad as I thought."
<es>

@533
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? I told you so."
<es>

@536
<en>{Natsume}\n"Quit while you're ahead."
<es>

@537
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't look at me with pity."
<es>

@540
<en>{Natsume}\n".........Hm?"
<es>

@541
<en>Suddenly, Natsume-chan looked at the sky.
<es>

@542
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@543
<en>{Natsume}\n"The wind stopped..."
<es>

@544
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wind?"
<es>

@545
<en>I noticed when she said it, because the wind that was blowing through Natsume-chan's hair until now had suddenly died down.
<es>

@547
<en>I felt like the hot air was growing stagnant and building up around us. The humid feel against my skin was fraying my nerves.
<es>

@548
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh... What's that smell?"
<es>

@549
<en>There was a sweet aroma wafting through the hot air. It was a very sweet fragrance, like that of fruit starting to rot.
<es>

@550
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think it's because of fall. Well, it might be a bit too early to call it fall..."
<es>

@553
<en>{Natsume}\n"........................"
<es>

@554
<en>Natsume-chan didn't say anything, but looked up at the blue sky of late summer.
<es>

@559
<en>I hadn't realized it yet, but the color of that sky was very similar to one that that I'd seen somewhere else before.
<es>

@560
<en>I had a hard time falling asleep that night.
<es>

@561
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know why I can't get to sleep. I'm usually out like a light."
<es>

@562
<en>I was known for being able to fall asleep instantly, but now I was suffering from insomnia. What a promotion that was...
<es>

@563
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know I shouldn't try to force myself to sleep at times like this."
<es>

@564
<en>I think I should try taking a walk. It looks nice outside, with the breeze and all.
<es>

@568
<en>It's so nice out here. It feels like a gentle autumn wind.
<es>

@569
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's already September, isn't it?"
<es>

@570
<en>This summer passed so quickly. I knew every summer seemed to fly by, but I felt this summer went super fast for me.
<es>

@571
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@576
<en>Oh, Natsume-chan. What's she doing here by herself?
<es>

@577
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hm?"
<es>

@578
<en>I asked myself that question. I remembered I'd met Natsume-chan at midnight before like this.
<es>

@579
<en>But that was only in my dream.
<es>

@580
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder if I'm dreaming now."
<es>

@581
<en>And also, the air seemed to have the same qualities. There was a suffocatingly sweet aroma, like the scent of flowers.
<es>

@582
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan, we're not back in that dream again, are we?"
<es>

@585
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hm?"
<es>

@586
<en>I think she noticed my voice.
<es>

@587
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma."
<es>

@590
<en>Natsume-chan rushed over to me and held my hand, like a child needing to stay hand in hand with an adult.
<es>

@591
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you doing out by yourself at this hour? This isn't a dream, is it?"
<es>

@594
<en>{Natsume}\n"No, this is reality."
<es>

@595
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see."
<es>

@596
<en>I was relieved.
<es>

@597
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I got flustered when I thought that you went back to the other world again."
<es>

@600
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm here. But..."
<es>

@601
<en>I looked up at the sky, wondering where this sweet aroma was coming from.
<es>

@604
<en>{Natsume}\n"........."
<es>

@605
<en>Natsume-chan kept looking at the night sky without moving. Her palm was getting sweaty in my hand for a change. She usually didn't sweat much.
<es>

@606
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@609
<en>{Natsume}\n"Is it really alright for me to be here...?"
<es>

@610
<en>She mumbled to herself. I'd only had a moment of relief and now I was worried about her again.
<es>

@611
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's wrong? Did something happen?"
<es>

@614
<en>{Natsume}\n"...No, nothing."
<es>

@615
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure?"
<es>

@618
<en>{Natsume}\n"........."
<es>

@619
<en>She looked like something was troubling. I wanted to know what was going on.
<es>

@620
<en>{Natsume}\n"I wish I could ride your bicycle again."
<es>

@621
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? My bicycle?"
<es>

@624
<en>{Natsume}\n"......Mhmm."
<es>

@625
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, you can have that anytime you want. Do you wanna go for a ride this weekend?"
<es>

@628
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah."
<es>

@629
<en>But somehow, she sounded blue. She seemed to be worrying about something, and I couldn't feel happy, even after I promised her a date.
<es>

@630
<en>What's going on? It must be this sweet aroma causing it. It really stirred up my emotions.
<es>

@633
<en>Thanks to that stench, I forgot to give her a goodnight kiss.
<es>

@639
<en>*Rustle*
<es>

@640
<en>A dark shadow passed through the woods that night. My night vision was working well and I saw it moving fast without ever stopping.
<es>

@641
<en>The shadow wasn't big, but rather a smaller silhouette. The gray hair stood out in the darkness...
<es>

@644
<en>It was Aozora Hisae.
<es>

@646
<en>{Principal}\n"Hm..."
<es>

@647
<en>I didn't know when she came to a stop, but she did before I knew it. She checked underneath her feet and looked around her.
<es>

@648
<en>She seemed to be searching for something.
<es>

@651
<en>{Principal}\n"......"
<es>

@652
<en>Satisfied with the spot, Hisae dropped something down there. A white flower standing out in the darkness.
<es>

@654
<en>Walking around the woods, Hisae planted flowers here and there. If you looked at them from above, you'd see a circle drawn around the woods.
<es>

@655
<en>Basically, it was a circle surrounding Eiden Academy, which stood at the summit.
<es>

@657
<en>An ordinary person wouldn't be able to see it, but the places where Hisae placed her spell formed an invisible boundary. It was a line to divide that outside and that inside.
<es>

@659
<en>When the border's beginning and end overlapped, it would close as a full circle.
<es>

@664
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh, I can't..."
<es>

@666
<en>I kicked my blanket off as I woke up. I couldn't sleep in this humid air, and I looked at the time.
<es>

@667
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's still three in the morning."
<es>

@668
<en>It was an odd time, not yet morning, but no longer night...
<es>

@669
<en>{Appo}\n"ZZZZZ~~~~"
<es>

@670
<en>Appo had been snoring away all night. I could tell he felt hot, because his blanket was also kicked off far away and his gut was uncovered.
<es>

@671
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why is it so hot?"
<es>

@672
<en>Why does it have to be this humid, even when it's almost autumn?
<es>

@673
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah, I don't hear any bugs tonight."
<es>

@674
<en>I remembered Natsume-chan mentioning the tunnel of bugs the other night, but tonight, it was quiet.
<es>

@675
<en>This silence could be one of the reasons why I can't sleep.
<es>

@676
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What could it be?"
<es>

@680
<en>I went outside since I couldn't sleep. The temperature was bearable when I felt the breeze, but without it, it was outrageously humid.
<es>

@681
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is reality, right?"
<es>

@682
<en>I questioned whether or not this was a dream. It kind of felt like there wasn't much reality in the air.
<es>

@683
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This could just be my imagination."
<es>

@684
<en>I knew Appo was sleeping in the dorm room. If I was in that other world, Natsume-chan would be the only one there. And she's not in that world anymore, either.
<es>

@685
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah, Natsume-chan."
<es>

@686
<en>I was worried about Natsume-chan. I had a bad feeling, just because I didn't give her a goodnight kiss tonight.
<es>

@687
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think I should go and check with the girls' dorm."
<es>

@692
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, Haruma-kun."
<es>

@693
<en>I saw Miya-san in front of girls' dorm.
<es>

@694
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, Miya-san."
<es>

@695
<en>I was surprised to see Miya-san this late.
<es>

@696
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you doing up this late?"
<es>

@699
<en>{Amamiya}\n"That's what I wanted to ask you. Why are you here, anyway?"
<es>

@700
<en>*Glare...* Miya-san's gentle eyes glared at me this time.
<es>

@703
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You're not planning to sneak into Natsume's room for anything tonight, are you?"
<es>

@704
<en>This was Amamiya Side B. He glared at me, filled with paternal love that freaked me out.
<es>

@705
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh no, I'd never dream of it."
<es>

@706
<en>I shook my head as hard as I could in denial.
<es>

@707
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, it is true I came to see Natsume-chan. I'm worried about her."
<es>

@710
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You too?"
<es>

@711
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then I guess the same goes for you, Miya-san?"
<es>

@714
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I just have this bad feeling."
<es>

@715
<en>He stroked his chest, as if he could rid himself of his frustration by doing that.
<es>

@718
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I thought I was too nervous about it, but if you feel the same way I do, then it may not just be my imagination."
<es>

@719
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you mean something's happened to Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@720
<en>Miya-san looked up at girls' dorm anxiously.
<es>

@721
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Let's go and check!"
<es>

@726
<en>*Knock, knock*
<es>

@727
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan! Natsume-chan!"
<es>

@728
<en>I called to her quietly. I didn't feel anything bad happening in this silence.
<es>

@731
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume, are you asleep?"
<es>

@732
<en>We kept calling for her, but there was no answer.
<es>

@733
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She might be asleep. Let's go inside."
<es>

@736
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Okay."
<es>

@737
<en>Miya-san placed his hand on the doorknob. It turned easily.
<es>

@740
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan."
<es>

@741
<en>In we went.
<es>

@744
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume? Are you here?"
<es>

@745
<en>Miya-san looked down at the bottom bunk.
<es>

@746
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan uses the top bunk."
<es>

@749
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Okay... Wait, why do you know that?"
<es>

@750
<en>The eyes gleaming in the darkness were evil.
<es>

@751
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, because she told me."
<es>

@754
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, I see... Sorry, I guess I'm too nervous."
<es>

@755
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's okay. But Natsume-chan... doesn't seem to be here."
<es>

@756
<en>She wasn't in the top bunk, either. The room was completely empty.
<es>

@759
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I think she used the bed tonight. That means she was asleep, but she got up and went somewhere."
<es>

@760
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where would she go at this hour?"
<es>

@761
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I don't know. She may be outside getting some fresh air."
<es>

@762
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's really hot tonight."
<es>

@763
<en>It felt hotter than before. What was going on with this heat?
<es>

@764
<en>I glanced outside and saw something strange.
<es>

@765
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There's smoke..."
<es>

@766
<en>I could see pitch black smoke trailing outside the window.
<es>

@770
<en>{Andou}\n"Fire! Fire!"
<es>

@773
<en>It was Andou's voice. With her cries as its cue, it became noisy outside.
<es>

@774
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Fire?"
<es>

@775
<en>I smelled something burning, but where was it coming from?
<es>

@778
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Haruma-kun, let's get outside."
<es>

@779
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right!"
<es>

@783
<en>The outside was full of black smoke. What heat! It feels like I'm in a steaming sauna.
<es>

@784
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There was nothing happening just a moment ago..."
<es>

@785
<en>It meant the flames were spreading quickly. I didn't have a good view thanks to all the black smoke, but I could catch glimpses of red flames behind it.
<es>

@788
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Over there!"
<es>

@789
<en>Miya-san dashed off, and I chased after him.
<es>

@790
<en>I looked down from the edge of the school property, and could see where the fire was coming from.
<es>

@791
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The woods..."
<es>

@792
<en>The woods surrounding our mountain were on fire - and they weren't only burning in one section.
<es>

@793
<en>The fire was spreading through the woods in all directions.
<es>

@796
<en>{Amamiya}\n"We're surrounded."
<es>

@797
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no...How are we going to escape like this?"
<es>

@798
<en>You have to go through the woods to leave the school, and the woods were burning, which meant we had no way out.
<es>

@799
<en>Everybody was panicking. More students left the dorm as they noticed the commotion. There were a lot of people hanging out in front of it.
<es>

@800
<en>They all freaked out when they found out the fire was surrounding us.
<es>

@803
<en>{Amamiya}\n"This is bad. I hope they don't start to panic."
<es>

@804
<en>I saw lots of male students coming from the boys' dorm too, and I noticed Pierre in the crowd.
<es>

@810
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, Kazushi! It's terrible!!"
<es>

@811
<en>{Daigo}\n"The woods are on fire! The flames are getting higher!"
<es>

@812
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know! Just try to stay calm!"
<es>

@815
<en>There was no way out, but the students ran around in a panic, trying to escape. In case you didn't know, that usually makes the situation worse.
<es>

@818
<en>{Appo}\n"Fuu-chan! Fuu-chan, are you alright?!"
<es>

@823
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Ah-chan! Your Kazuko is safe!"
<es>

@828
<en>They cuddled happily to celebrate their reunion.
<es>

@833
<en>{Sakura}\n"I'm glad you're together and all that, but we can't escape from here, can we?"
<es>

@834
<en>Sakura was usually indifferent about things, but this time, her face was pale.
<es>

@835
<en>I didn't blame her. If the flames grew higher than they were now, all of us would be wiped out.
<es>

@839
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Is this a... giant furnace?"
<es>

@840
<en>Miya-san muttered, as he looked at the burning flames.
<es>

@841
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A giant furnace?"
<es>

@842
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I mean the situation we're in now. Don't you think it's similar?"
<es>

@843
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......ah."
<es>

@844
<en>If you objectively analyzed our circumstances, you'd notice we were confined to the school property with no way out.
<es>

@845
<en>And there were flames burning beneath us.
<es>

@846
<en>It's was similar with our lab equipment - like a flask sitting over a burner.
<es>

@847
<en>The flames of the woods were the fire of our burner, the flask was Eiden Academy, and inside of it was...
<es>

@850
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The male principal and female principal..."
<es>

@851
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Boys and girls?"

@858
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I think she's trying to draw forth a great power by using a giant furnace."
<es>

@859
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shit!! Is she insane!?"
<es>

@860
<en>We had to stop her immediately. Where was the principal? I couldn't see either the principal or Natsume-chan.
<es>

@866
<en>{Haruka}\n"Everybody, calm down!!"
<es>

@867
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't run! Stay as a group!"

<es>

@878
<en>Thanks to Yagami-sensei and Panchu, all the boys quickly calmed down.
<es>

@881
<en>{Mei}\n"I'll take a roll call, so come on over here, everybody! Is anybody missing?"
<es>

@882
<en>I could also see the girls were recovering their composure.
<es>

@887
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Mei-chan! Natsume-chan is missing!"
<es>

@890
<en>{Mei}\n"Anyone! Has anyone seen Amamiya-san?! Is there anyone who's seen Amamiya-san?!"
<es>

@895
<en>Mei-sensei was shouting, but nobody knew where Natsume-chan was. Miya's face turned white.
<es>

@896
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry. Natsume-chan wouldn't get wrapped up in this that easily."
<es>

@897
<en>{Amamiya}\n"That's right. It's not very easy to hurt that girl in the first place."
<es>

@898
<en>That's right. Natsume-chan's existence was special.
<es>

@899
<en>She held enough power to destroy this world if she wanted.
<es>

@907
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, Kazushi! I heard Natsume-chan isn't here."
<es>

@908
<en>The three of them were rushing over here.
<es>

@911
<en>{Appo}\n"What are you daydreaming about? Let's go and look for her!"
<es>

@912
<en>{Daigo}\n"Let's split up!"
<es>

@913
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks for your help!"

<es>

@921
<en>We started moving on Panchu's command.
<es>

@927
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Damn it! This side is blocked."
<es>

@928
<en>The woods were raging from the flames. I felt the burning heat just from standing here.
<es>

@929
<en>And then, I saw a small figure behind the flames.
<es>

@932
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae-san..."
<es>

@933
<en>It was Hisae, not Natsume. As he quietly called out to her, the small figure turned around.
<es>

@938
<en>{Principal}\n"Oh, it's Miya-san."
<es>

@939
<en>Contrary to Amamiya-san's expectation, Hisae was in her right mind.
<es>

@940
<en>Although he thought she went mad and started the fire in the woods, she was perfectly calm, which made her that much more terrifying.
<es>

@941
<en>Amamiya couldn't understand how she could come to regard the entire school as a mere furnace if she was in her right mind.
<es>

@942
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae-san, please stop this."
<es>

@943
<en>It wasn't too late at this point. If she put out the fire and stopped the refinement, we could all be okay, but if she kept going...
<es>

@946
<en>{Principal}\n"Miya, your daughter is phenomenal."
<es>

@949
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What?"
<es>

@950
<en>Amamiya got nervous when he heard the principal suddenly mentioning Natsume.
<es>

@952
<en>{Principal}\n"Although it was incomplete, the stone she swallowed was completely absorbed into her body. And the only time its power nearly took control was immediately after she swallowed it."
<es>

@956
<en>{Principal}\n"Like father, like daughter... She definitely inherited the Amamiya family's alchemist blood."
<es>

@957
<en>Miya felt terrified when he heard Hisae speaking in a calm manner.
<es>

@960
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Don't tell me Natsume's..."
<es>

@961
<en>He felt his hair stand on end and his body grow hot.
<es>

@964
<en>{Principal}\n"She's a living mystery. The power she has is under her control. But that is because that stone was still incomplete."
<es>

@965
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Do you mean this is a re-refinement?"
<es>

@966
<en>The edges of her lips were raised, as if in a triumphant smile.
<es>

@967
<en>This burning forest was the furnace for alchemy. The school was the flask - the philosopher's egg.
<es>

@968
<en>And the thing being refined was the mysterious stone inside Natsume.
<es>

@969
<en>Was she trying to re-refine the stone whose refinement was interrupted?
<es>

@970
<en>{Principal}\n"We don't want to waste something that's made it this far."
<es>

@973
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What's going to happen to Natsume?"
<es>

@974
<en>The balance between Natsume and the stone seemed perfect.
<es>

@975
<en>But we didn't know what would happen when they became unbalanced.
<es>

@978
<en>{Principal}\n"We'll only know what's going to happen once we try; otherwise nothing will happen for sure."
<es>

@981
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Nothing needs to happen."
<es>

@982
<en>{Principal}\n"I need power. Without power, I cannot make that miracle happen."
<es>

@983
<en>{Amamiya}\n"That's beyond human ability. Please open your eyes. What you're trying to do is..."
<es>

@986
<en>{Principal}\n"Be quiet!"
<es>

@987
<en>Hisae uttered angrily, giving Amamiya-san a glaring look.
<es>

@988
<en>{Principal}\n"If you say it's not within human ability, then I simply need to go beyond that."
<es>

@989
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I sympathize with you. But I have something I must protect as well. So please, put out this fire."
<es>

@992
<en>{Principal}\n"I cannot do that."
<es>

@993
<en>Hisae and Amamiya looked at each other. They were staring at each other without blinking, as if their gazes sent sparks flying.
<es>

@996
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Then I will have to stop you by force."
<es>

@997
<en>He turned to Hisae with determination, and Hisae responded to him with a gentle smile.
<es>

@1001
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan! Where are you?"
<es>

@1004
<en>{Appo}\n"Natsume-chan! I'll give you some candy, so come out!"
<es>

@1005
<en>We ran around calling her name, but still no answer...
<es>

@1006
<en>{Appo}\n"I don't think she's here?"
<es>

@1007
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She wasn't in the girls' dorm, and nobody can leave the school grounds...so, the last possibility is ..."
<es>

@1008
<en>{Appo}\n"Pierre and Daigo are looking up by the lab."
<es>

@1010
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, where else should we look?"
<es>

@1011
<en>I thought the fire must be near, because I could clearly hear the crackling of the flames.
<es>

@1014
<en>{Appo}\n"Hey, don't you think it's quiet out there?"
<es>

@1015
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1016
<en>When he said that, I realized that I could hear the roaring flames nearby because no other sound was interrupting them.
<es>

@1017
<en>I didn't hear the commotion of people like before.
<es>

@1018
<en>It sounded like nobody was out there.
<es>

@1019
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did everyone evacuate somewhere?"
<es>

@1022
<en>{Appo}\n"They probably did. We should get going, too."
<es>

@1023
<en>Appo must've been feeling something bad, because his face looked very nervous.
<es>

@1024
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's head back real quick."
<es>

@1028
<en>As soon as we got out, I felt the stiflingly hot air. The black smoke turned white, creating a hazy view all over.
<es>

@1031
<en>{Appo}\n"Whoa, it's hot."
<es>

@1032
<en>The smell of hot air and burning smoke. A different smell hung thick in the air together with those scents of burning.
<es>

@1035
<en>{Appo}\n"Hmm... What's that smell?"
<es>

@1036
<en>It smelled like rusting iron. That's...
<es>

@1037
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you smell blood...?"
<es>

@1038
<en>It was the stifling smell of blood.
<es>

@1041
<en>{Appo}\n"Smells like someone's period."
<es>

@1042
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why do you have to use that example?"
<es>

@1045
<en>{Appo}\n"Because right now Fuu-chan's..."
<es>

@1046
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't say it. I don't want to hear it."
<es>

@1049
<en>{Appo}\n"C'mon... Well, I guess there's nobody here."
<es>

@1050
<en>I looked around again. There was so much commotion people nearly panicked before, but now no one was here.
<es>

@1051
<en>{Appo}\n"Everyone must have evacuated somewhere..."
<es>

@1052
<en>*Slip!*.
<es>

@1056
<en>{Appo}\n"Wah...!"
<es>

@1061
<en>Appo tripped and fell down.
<es>

@1062
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you okay?"
<es>

@1065
<en>{Appo}\n"Ouch... I slipped on something... Hhhhhhh?!!!"
<es>

@1066
<en>Appo screamed as he looked down beneath his feet.
<es>

@1069
<en>{Appo}\n"Blood... this is blood!"
<es>

@1070
<en>There was a puddle of blood underneath his feet. When I looked carefully, I saw the ground completely drenched in dark red.
<es>

@1071
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I-is this all blood?"
<es>

@1072
<en>{Appo}\n"What's going on here? Where is everybody?"
<es>

@1073
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What the hell happened here?"
<es>

@1076
<en>Then, the wind blew. The white smoke trailed away and the view was clear.
<es>

@1077
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh?!"
<es>

@1079
<en>I wondered if it was due to the flames. The night sky burned a bright red, as if the very sky itself had been stained with blood.
<es>

@1081
<en>Our world was full of red, and in the middle of that red world...
<es>

@1083
<en>Stood a certain someone.
<es>

@1084
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@1085
<en>Who is that?!
<es>

@1094
<en>{Principal}\n"Ngh?!"
<es>

@1097
<en>Amamiya threw himself against Hisae, and she crashed with her back on the ground. Then, Amamiya quickly climbed on top of her.
<es>

@1101
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It's all over! Now put out these fires!"
<es>

@1102
<en>Amamiya had won for certain, but Hisae just grinned.
<es>

@1106
<en>{Principal}\n"I think it's a little too late for that."
<es>

@1110
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What?!"
<es>

@1111
<en>Hisae looked up at the sky as well as Miya-san, who followed her lead.
<es>

@1112
<en>{Amamiya}\n"This is..."
<es>

@1113
<en>There was a blood red sky hovering over their heads.
<es>

@1114
<en>{Principal}\n"Rubedo."
<es>

@1115
<en>Rubedo - the name of the final stage in alchemy. It proved how far Hisae's refining had come.
<es>

@1116
<en>It meant the stone inside Natsume was coming close to completion.
<es>

@1119
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume!"
<es>

@1120
<en>When he called his daughter's name...
<es>

@1127
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Ow...!"
<es>

@1131
<en>Hisae stabbed Amamiya's heart with a dagger.
<es>

@1132
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae...san."
<es>

@1136
<en>Amamiya-san collapsed, spewing up blood through his mouth. Then Hisae crawled over Amamiya's body on the ground.
<es>

@1139
<en>She stood up and started walking, her gleaming eyes looking straight up into the air.
<es>

@1146
<en>I didn't realize who it was at first. No, I knew immediately. There was no way I'd mistake that figure.
<es>

@1148
<en>My rational nature refused to accept it. I knew for certain that it was Natsume-chan.
<es>

@1149
<en>{Appo}\n"W-what's that? A Japanese sword?"
<es>

@1150
<en>Natsume-chan was holding a Japanese sword that was as long as her body. The blade and her body were both stained in fresh blood.
<es>

@1151
<en>I didn't want to think about whose blood it was.
<es>

@1152
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan..."
<es>

@1153
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@1154
<en>Her eyes were hidden by her hair as she looked at me.
<es>

@1155
<en>{Appo}\n"Hhh... hhhh?!"
<es>

@1156
<en>Appo crawled back on all fours.
<es>

@1157
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Appo!"
<es>

@1158
<en>{Natsume}\n"...!!!"
<es>

@1159
<en>Natsume-chan flew towards Appo like the wind, her bloody red sword shining in the blazing fire.
<es>

@1161
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume...!!"
<es>

@1166
<en>SWISH!!!
<es>

@1167
<en>{Kazushi}\n"!!?"
<es>

@1168
<en>The sword brutally swung down, and cleanly severed Appo's head.
<es>

@1169
<en>His head flew through the air, struck the blood stained ground, and rolled several meters away.
<es>

@1172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A-Appo..."
<es>

@1173
<en>I couldn't find the words to describe this sheer terror. At the same time, I felt numb and couldn't move my body.\nWhat the hell's going on here?
<es>

@1176
<en>{Natsume}\n"........."
<es>

@1177
<en>I found Natsume-chan standing in front of me as I was petrified.
<es>

@1178
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan..."
<es>

@1179
<en>That was all I could say. I wondered if she was defeated by the power of the stone in her body.
<es>

@1182
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@1183
<en>Natsume-chan silently turned her sword in my direction, pointing the tip at my heart.
<es>

@1184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan..."
<es>

@1187
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ngh!!"
<es>

@1188
<en>Natsume-chan looked down. She looks like she was grimacing in agony.
<es>

@1189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume......"
<es>

@1192
<en>{Natsume}\n"Nggh!!"
<es>

@1193
<en>I steadied myself at the moment when Natsume-chan closed her eyes.
<es>

@1194
<en>Natsume-chan used her body to point her sword at me.
<es>

@1196
<en>I closed my eyes as well. I didn't try to ward it off; I spread my arms out to take in her attack.
<es>

@1198
<en>*Shooom!*
<es>

@1199
<en>I felt something run through me. Then, something soft and small fell against my chest.
<es>

@1200
<en>{Natsume}\n"Huh...?"
<es>

@1201
<en>I held something lovely and warm in my arms.
<es>

@1205
<en>When I opened my eyes, I saw Natsume-chan.
<es>

@1206
<en>Her eyes popped open, and she looked up at my face in surprise.
<es>

@1207
<en>{Natsume}\n"Why?"
<es>

@1208
<en>I wondered if she wanted to know why I didn't fend off her sword, or...
<es>

@1209
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I thought so."
<es>

@1210
<en>{Natsume}\n"Huh...?"
<es>

@1211
<en>Her eyes opened wider in surprise. The sword was impaled up to the hilt in my chest, but I wasn't feeling any pain.
<es>

@1212
<en>It just felt...weird.
<es>

@1213
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If you don't think it hurts, it doesn't."
<es>

@1214
<en>{Natsume}\n"W-why?"
<es>

@1215
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Because I trust you, Natsume-chan. And because I figured it out."
<es>

@1218
<en>{Natsume}\n"What are you talking about?"
<es>

@1219
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Someone trying to kill me wouldn't make such a painful face. That's how I figured out that you didn't want to do such an evil thing to me."
<es>

@1222
<en>{Natsume}\n"But...it's too hard to kill you, even in my dreams, Haruma."
<es>

@1223
<en>That's right. This was only a dream. I'd been feeling like something was off. We were back in that dream world.
<es>

@1224
<en>That's why I didn't feel pain, even when I got stabbed. But, I couldn't understand one thing: why was everybody else here?
<es>

@1225
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's going on here?"
<es>

@1226
<en>Natsume-chan backed away from me. I saw her removing the sword from my body. It didn't hurt, but it felt sickening.
<es>

@1229
<en>{Natsume}\n"Right now we're in a big philosopher's egg - a flask."
<es>

@1230
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, so I thought right then."
<es>

@1231
<en>Miya-san's hypothesis was right. This was a been a gigantic refining experiment.
<es>

@1232
<en>{Natsume}\n"The entirety of the school's grounds are overlapping with that world. We're in the middle of a large-scale cross-breeding of worlds."
<es>

@1233
<en>In other words, the cross-breeding of worlds that usually happened only in small flasks was suddenly occurring all over the campus?
<es>

@1234
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then... this place is in that world?"
<es>

@1237
<en>{Natsume}\n"Half is. The other half is in our original world. It is in both and at the same time, in neither."
<es>

@1238
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where'd everybody go?"
<es>

@1239
<en>When I looked around, I saw that Appo's head had disappeared, meaning he shouldn't have actually died.
<es>

@1242
<en>{Natsume}\n"I forcefully sent him back to the other world. Nobody dies in this world because death does not exist here. With death comes a new awakening."
<es>

@1243
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@1244
<en>Awakening... If we woke up, we'd all go back to the world we used to belong to. I guess that meant everybody was safe. That thought made me relieved.
<es>

@1245
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You saved us, Natsume-chan."
<es>

@1248
<en>{Natsume}\n"I just did it for myself. Otherwise, I wouldn't have a home to go back to."
<es>

@1249
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@1250
<en>I felt happy when I heard Natsume-chan calling the place where we spent time together home.
<es>

@1251
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, that was dangerous way to handle things. I wish you could've done it a little more gently."
<es>

@1252
<en>Well, that was perfectly in tune for Natsume-chan.
<es>

@1255
<en>{Natsume}\n"They needed a shock such as the thought that they were dead. Without a strong shock like that, they couldn't wake up from inside the dream."
<es>

@1256
<en>If you want to wake someone who was asleep, you just need to wiggle their body, but only a person who's not sleeping can do that.
<es>

@1257
<en>To wake up from within a dream, you need a shock like the one Natsume-chan gave them.
<es>

@1260
<en>{Natsume}\n"So you need to die too, Haruma. Hurry up and die."
<es>

@1261
<en>She raised the sword.
<es>

@1262
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, hold on, hold on! What about you, Natsume-chan?!"
<es>

@1263
<en>After sending us away, what would you do here all by yourself?
<es>

@1264
<en>{Natsume}\n"I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. Hurry up and die."
<es>

@1265
<en>*Woosh, swish, slash*
<es>

@1266
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wah! Hey, hey, hey! This won't help!"
<es>

@1267
<en>As you said, death doesn't exist in this world.
<es>

@1268
<en>So what killed everyone wasn't the wound from the sword, but the perception that "one dies when stabbed".
<es>

@1269
<en>Once you realized that common sense didn't apply, and death didn't exist here, then you can't die.
<es>

@1270
<en>{Natsume}\n"Die. Die. Die."
<es>

@1271
<en>*Woosh, swish, slash*
<es>

@1272
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I won't die, and it won't hurt either. But it's not very pleasant, so could you please stop?"
<es>

@1275
<en>{Natsume}\n"Grrr..."
<es>

@1276
<en>Natsume-chan was bewildered.
<es>

@1279
<en>{Natsume}\n"What am I gonna do? Now you can't get back, Haruma."
<es>

@1280
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How can I go back and leave you here all alone? I'll only go back when you come with me."
<es>

@1283
<en>{Natsume}\n"We don't have much time to think about that."
<es>

@1284
<en>Just then, I felt somebody behind me.
<es>

@1285
<en>{Principal}\n"Look at this..."
<es>

@1288
<en>The voice caused us to turn around by reflex, and there was the person who caused this whole affair: the principal.
<es>

@1292
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Principal!"
<es>

@1293
<en>The principal was wobbling over to us, staring straight at Natsume-chan.
<es>

@1294
<en>{Principal}\n"How did you manage to remain sane? Why isn't the stone inside you maturing?"
<es>

@1299
<en>{Natsume}\n"So that's what you were refining. Too bad. This stone is no longer what you made, Hisae."
<es>

@1300
<en>{Principal}\n"What did you say?"
<es>

@1303
<en>{Natsume}\n"I have Haruma's blood inside me now. It's been tempered by me and Haruma. Haruma has also damaged it for me."
<es>

@1304
<en>I felt happy when Natsume-chan smiled at me. I guess I helped her out, even if only a little.
<es>

@1305
<en>{Principal}\n"You're lying."
<es>

@1306
<en>The principal was glaring at Natsume-chan and I, casting the enormous feeling of hatred that she felt in our direction.
<es>

@1310
<en>{Natsume}\n"Do you hate me? I've always hated you."
<es>

@1311
<en>{Natsume}\n"I haven't liked you since the time you first visited us to see Papa when I was little. I knew you'd take Papa away from me someday."
<es>

@1312
<en>It could have been women's intuition. After all, everything that happened was exactly as Natsume-chan had feared.
<es>

@1313
<en>Because Miya-san had to come to this island, leaving Natsume-chan alone at home.
<es>

@1316
<en>{Natsume}\n"But the situation has changed. I feel sorry for you, Hisae."
<es>

@1321
<en>{Principal}\n"What did you say?"
<es>

@1322
<en>The principal became angry with what she'd said. It must have been a massive humiliation for her.
<es>

@1325
<en>{Natsume}\n"You always blame yourself for things that can't be helped. That's why I feel sorry for you."
<es>

@1326
<en>{Principal}\n"How... How dare you..."
<es>

@1327
<en>The principal looked furious. I really didn't get what Natsume-chan meant, but I saw the principal becoming agitated by it.
<es>

@1330
<en>{Natsume}\n"You poor thing. I realized that once I met Haruma. That's why I'm sending you back too, Hisae."
<es>

@1331
<en>Natsume-chan raised her sword.
<es>

@1335
<en>{Principal}\n"Ah...?"
<es>

@1336
<en>The principal mumbled pitifully in front of Natsume-chan's bare sword. Without trying to defend herself, the principal closed her eyes, offering up her body.
<es>

@1337
<en>{Natsume}\n"See you later..."
<es>

@1343
<en>Natsume-chan cut down the principal with her sword. She fell, vanishing away as if she was melting into the earth.
<es>

@1346
<en>{Natsume}\n"You're the last one to go, Haruma."
<es>

@1347
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, you need to come, too. I won't go home without you."
<es>

@1350
<en>{Natsume}\n"But you don't know when..."
<es>

@1354
<en>Just then, the world began to brighten up. The sky was changing rapidly from a blood red to fresh, pale blue.
<es>

@1355
<en>The sky became clear in the blink of an eye.
<es>

@1358
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@1362
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is..."
<es>

@1363
<en>White flowers where blooming everywhere. It was quiet. The sounds of the flames were gone.
<es>

@1366
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's too late. It's been completely replaced."
<es>

@1367
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Replaced...? Then we're in that world now?"
<es>

@1368
<en>The place where Natsume-chan and I met for the first time. Where there was no concept of time. And we were completely sealed in.
<es>

@1375
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hm... Huh?!"
<es>

@1376
<en>Amamiya sprung to his feet and checked his body. But there were no cuts from where Hisae had stabbed him.
<es>

@1377
<en>{Amamiya}\n"A dream...?"
<es>

@1378
<en>It was natural to think it was a dream. But something wasn't right. There was no reason for him to be sleeping there.
<es>

@1379
<en>{Principal}\n"Mmm..."
<es>

@1380
<en>He noticed Hisae laying there beside him.
<es>

@1383
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae-san?"
<es>

@1384
<en>He called out to her, prompting Hisae to open her eyes.
<es>

@1389
<en>{Principal}\n"Where am I?"
<es>

@1390
<en>She looked around as if she'd just woken up from a dream. She took a deep sigh as she started understanding the situation around her.
<es>

@1391
<en>{Principal}\n"It would appear I was saved."
<es>

@1392
<en>Then she realized that Natsume's true motive was to save her.
<es>

@1393
<en>"I was hoping I could get closer to him."
<es>

@1396
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Where's Natsume? Where are those two?"
<es>

@1397
<en>Amamiya was looking for his daughter, but she was nowhere to be found.
<es>

@1398
<en>{Principal}\n"Those two are probably still in there. They must be trapped there by now."
<es>

@1401
<en>{Amamiya}\n"No way!!"
<es>

@1402
<en>Amamiya fell into despair. "Once again, I failed to save her."
<es>

@1406
<en>{Amamiya}\n"No, not yet."
<es>

@1407
<en>If I give up hope on her now, things will end the same as before. I promised Kazushi that I would be a good father for Natsume.
<es>

@1408
<en>I know there has to be something I can do to save her.
<es>

@1413
<en>We were just standing there. It was the ideal world for an alchemist. With it closed off, it became perfect.
<es>

@1416
<en>{Natsume}\n"Uugh..."
<es>

@1417
<en>Natsume-chan gave a grunt, and dropped her rear end on the grass. She just sat still in a feminine way.
<es>

@1418
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What happened? Are you hurt somewhere?"
<es>

@1421
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm sorry, Haruma."
<es>

@1422
<en>I was puzzled when she suddenly apologized to me, since she'd never done that before.
<es>

@1423
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's wrong? Why are you apologizing to me?"
<es>

@1424
<en>{Natsume}\n"I can't send you back there anymore. We've been completely taken in."
<es>

@1425
<en>That's what she'd been thinking about.
<es>

@1426
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you worried about something small like that? It isn't your fault, is it?"
<es>

@1429
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes, it is my fault."
<es>

@1430
<en>Natsume-chan drooped her head in sadness. I don't think I'd ever seen Natsume-chan feeling down like this before.
<es>

@1431
<en>{Natsume}\n"I could've sent you away like I did to Hisae, but I couldn't do that to you."
<es>

@1432
<en>{Natsume}\n"That's why you got caught up in this too."
<es>

@1433
<en>Natsume-chan frowned as if trying to endure something. Her lips were trembling harder and harder.
<es>

@1435
<en>{Natsume}\n"Whahh... eegh..."
<es>

@1436
<en>She couldn't bear it any longer, and started letting out sobs.
<es>

@1437
<en>{Natsume}\n"I know it's my fault that you couldn't go back."
<es>

@1438
<en>Natsume-chan began shedding tears as she glared at me.
<es>

@1439
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan..."
<es>

@1440
<en>She was crying. I felt ashamed of myself for not knowing what to say to her.
<es>

@1441
<en>{Natsume}\n"I could've sent you away if I wanted, but I had a tremendous sense of hesitation until the last moment."
<es>

@1442
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Because you were thinking about me, right?"
<es>

@1443
<en>She knew I wouldn't die for real, but she hesitated to kill me with a sword.
<es>

@1444
<en>{Natsume}\n"No, it's not that... *sniff*...."
<es>

@1445
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? It's not?"
<es>

@1448
<en>{Natsume}\n"Actually, I was afraid of being alone again... If you left, I'd have nobody with me, so I just wanted to keep you here no matter what."
<es>

@1449
<en>Her twisted lips pressed further down, and her face was a mess of tears.
<es>

@1450
<en>{Natsume}\n"I wanted to be with you, Haruma. When I thought about being separated from you, I just couldn't deal with it."
<es>

@1451
<en>{Natsume}\n"I was ready to live by myself when Mama died. If I'd never gotten to know you, I probably would've been fine staying alone forever."
<es>

@1452
<en>{Natsume}\n"I could bear that before, but not anymore. You made me long to be with people. So you should take responsibility and stay with me forever..."
<es>

@1453
<en>Her small frame was making larger movements as she shuddered. I had to wonder what this poor girl was still afraid of and enduring even now.
<es>

@1454
<en>{Natsume}\n"You'll always be with me..."
<es>

@1455
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure."
<es>

@1456
<en>{Natsume}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@1457
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll always be with you. Actually, I was going to ask you to stay with me."
<es>

@1458
<en>I would never turn Natsume-chan away. I would never leave her behind and go somewhere.
<es>

@1459
<en>{Natsume}\n"........."
<es>

@1460
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you looking at?"
<es>

@1461
<en>{Natsume}\n"You, with me?"
<es>

@1462
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I'll stay with you. We're together now, aren't we?"
<es>

@1463
<en>{Natsume}\n"Are you sure it's okay?"
<es>

@1464
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course."
<es>

@1465
<en>She nodded in a big swooping curve, and a wave of tears broke out to splash down her face.
<es>

@1466
<en>{Natsume}\n"Whaa, eegh... Waaaaaaaaaa!!!"
<es>

@1467
<en>Natsume-chan began to cry, wailing louder than a little kid without shame.
<es>

@1468
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why do you have to cry?"
<es>

@1469
<en>Smiling bitterly, I held Natsume-chan's small frame as she continued to bawl. Then, she flung her arms around me and cried louder.
<es>

@1470
<en>{Natsume}\n"Eegh, hahh, waaaaaaaaaa!!!"
<es>

@1471
<en>Her tense string finally snapped. I wondered how much pressure it held. How much had she endured with her tiny body?
<es>

@1473
<en>Natsume-chan kept crying as if tear gland was ruptured.
<es>

@1476
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wahah, eegh, eehhh..."
<es>

@1477
<en>She finally settled down after crying for a while; her tears dried up and only a few sobs remaining.
<es>

@1478
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you feel better?"
<es>

@1479
<en>{Natsume}\n".........Uh-huh."
<es>

@1480
<en>She nodded as she clung onto my body. She wouldn't remove her hands, and I could feel her firm grip on my body.
<es>

@1481
<en>It was the first time I'd seen Natsume-chan get so emotional.
<es>

@1482
<en>She must've been bottling everything up until now.
<es>

@1483
<en>She couldn't see her dad for a long time, got banished to that weird world... She had to bear all those things patiently and all by herself.
<es>

@1484
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't need to worry about it anymore. If you want me to be with you forever, I'll gladly do so."
<es>

@1485
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, even if you don't like it, I'll still be here with you."
<es>

@1486
<en>{Natsume}\n"Really?"
<es>

@1487
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really."
<es>

@1490
<en>{Natsume}\n"What'll happen if you're lying? You may regret staying in this place."
<es>

@1491
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll never regret it."
<es>

@1492
<en>{Natsume}\n"You finally got me out, and now we're back where we started? We're back to the beginning."
<es>

@1493
<en>She was right. I saved her from this world, but she was back there once again.
<es>

@1494
<en>But it wasn't exactly same as before.
<es>

@1495
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This time, I'm here with you."
<es>

@1498
<en>Natsume-chan lifted her head, and I smiled at her, as she still looked anxious.
<es>

@1499
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't you see? It's different from before. We're together this time - you're not here by yourself anymore."
<es>

@1500
<en>Right. She's not alone. We're together... that's a big difference.
<es>

@1501
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Since you really decided to be with me, I'll never let you down in your decision. I'll prove to you it wasn't the wrong one."
<es>

@1504
<en>{Natsume}\n"But, this is it. There's no way to go back home."
<es>

@1505
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, we'll get back."
<es>

@1508
<en>{Natsume}\n"What?"
<es>

@1509
<en>Natsume-chan looked surprised, because in her mind, she thought she could never go back. But I never doubted we'd be able to return.
<es>

@1510
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How could I dare stay in this kind of place for all my life? They say it's an ideal world, but I'll feel suffocated if I live here."
<es>

@1513
<en>{Natsume}\n"Whatever you say, we can't get out here."
<es>

@1514
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes we can."
<es>

@1517
<en>{Natsume}\n"What? ...How?"
<es>

@1518
<en>My grades weren't very good, and I didn't know much about alchemy, so I didn't have any brilliant thoughts or methods.
<es>

@1519
<en>There was a limit to what I can do.
<es>

@1520
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You said this was the world created by human desire, right?"
<es>

@1523
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah? I said that..."
<es>

@1524
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I agree with you."
<es>

@1525
<en>I thought it was stupid to believe in immortality or changing lead into gold, but somebody obviously wanted it pretty badly.
<es>

@1526
<en>That person longed for it strong enough to create the world we're in now.
<es>

@1527
<en>Sure, you might be able to get the gold and eternity that person wanted here.
<es>

@1528
<en>But I believed they weren't necessary for obtaining happiness.
<es>

@1529
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If this is a twisted world, then this world doesn't need to exist."
<es>

@1532
<en>{Natsume}\n"What?"
<es>

@1533
<en>I held Natsume-chan's hand as she looked at me in surprise.
<es>

@1534
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then let's destroy this place, and go back where we belong."
<es>

@1535
<en>{Natsume}\n"Destroy this place?"
<es>

@1536
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who needs a place like this? Don't you wanna go back?"
<es>

@1537
<en>I gripped her hand and looked into her eyes. I saw the light of resolve returning to those lost eyes.
<es>

@1540
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah, I want to go back with you."
<es>

@1541
<en>Natsume-chan nodded, determinately.
<es>

@1542
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then let's go home."
<es>

@1543
<en>I pulled on her hands and helped her stand up.
<es>

@1544
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know everybody's waiting for us."
<es>

@1551
<en>{Natsume}\n"But how are you going to destroy this?"
<es>

@1552
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No idea! We're just going to destroy it!"
<es>

@1554
<en>I take a shovel from the garden, and began hammering repeatedly on the school walls.
<es>

@1555
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Gaaaah! It's so hard! It's not breaking at all!"
<es>

@1558
<en>{Natsume}\n"I think you're wasting your time by doing that."
<es>

@1559
<en>I felt a stinging sensation in my hands. I wasn't sure if I could make it happen that way.
<es>

@1560
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's odd. I thought I could do it. Was it just my imagination?"
<es>

@1561
<en>I figured we could just break it without really thinking, but I guess not?
<es>

@1564
<en>{Natsume}\n"...No, if you thought you could do it, then you might be able to."
<es>

@1565
<en>Her words gave me a great encouragement when I was going to give up.
<es>

@1566
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? Think I can?"
<es>

@1569
<en>{Natsume}\n"Our instinct is right pretty often. If that's what you thought, then maybe we can. I'm sure that instinct is right."
<es>

@1570
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess you're right. I feel better now that I have your green light."
<es>

@1572
<en>The problem was how we could do it. Being in a world created by alchemy, it was clear that we couldn't do it with brute force alone.
<es>

@1573
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan, can't you shoot destructo-beams or something with alchemy?"
<es>

@1576
<en>{Natsume}\n"What do you think I am? Is that the kind of girlfriend you want?"
<es>

@1577
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No... but electric shocks might be just right."
<es>

@1578
<en>{Natsume}\n"I can't do that either. Are you a masochist?"
<es>

@1579
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know. I could be..."
<es>

@1582
<en>{Natsume}\n"I see..."
<es>

@1583
<en>She was seriously contemplating something.
<es>

@1586
<en>{Natsume}\n"...No!"
<es>

@1587
<en>Suddenly, she was herself again.
<es>

@1590
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, I don't know why, but you seem to be compatible with this place so I'm sure you'll think of a good idea."
<es>

@1591
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm compatible with it?"
<es>

@1592
<en>I didn't know that, but Natsume-chan wanted to believe it.
<es>

@1593
<en>{Natsume}\n"Think about it: it isn't right for you to be able to come in and out of this world through your dreams. You must have a connection to this place."
<es>

@1594
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What kind of connection?"
<es>

@1597
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't know."
<es>

@1598
<en>Natsume-chan lost her confidence. I knew there wasn't any evidence for it, but I felt something strong about that place.
<es>

@1599
<en>I felt some kind of agitation inside me, but I didn't know the cause of it.
<es>

@1603
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@1604
<en>Then, something lit up out of nowhere. Natsume-chan noticed it as well.
<es>

@1607
<en>{Natsume}\n"Looks like somebody's attempting a refinement."
<es>

@1608
<en>Natsume-chan muttered, looking at our surroundings.
<es>

@1609
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A refinement? Who could it... Oh!"
<es>

@1610
<en>If there's a refinement going on, it must be in our original world. Alchemic refinement was one way to approach this world from ours.
<es>

@1611
<en>So that means there's a path between the two now, right?
<es>

@1612
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hey, Haruma!"
<es>

@1613
<en>I heard Natsume-chan shouting at me, and then I found the reason.
<es>

@1614
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's!"

@1615
<en>I saw a column of light rising from the corner of the island, shooting up from the ground all the way into the sky.
<es>

@1616
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan, over there?"
<es>

@1617
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah, over there. That's where the other space is intervening with this one."
<es>

@1618
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay, let's hurry."
<es>

@1623
<en>The beam was coming from basement directly under the school.
<es>

@1624
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't know this kind of thing existed under the school."
<es>

@1627
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, look over there!"
<es>

@1628
<en>Natsume-chan pointed into the back. Even I could feel the tremendous energy emanating from it.
<es>

@1629
<en>I knew something had to be happening over there, so we hurried up and went to check it out.
<es>

@1630
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@1631
<en>And then we saw it.
<es>

@1634
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma."
<es>

@1635
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah."
<es>

@1636
<en>What we saw was a tiny stone, about the size of an egg. It wasn't particularly big, and sat easily in the palm of your hand.
<es>

@1637
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is no ordinary rock, is it?"
<es>

@1638
<en>{Natsume}\n"No, it's..."
<es>

@1641
<en>SKREEEEEEEEEEEE...
<es>

@1642
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ow..."
<es>

@1643
<en>Just then, I heard a shrill noise from somewhere.
<es>

@1644
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ngh, what is it?"
<es>

@1645
<en>It became a louder buzzing, going straight into my ear.
<es>

@1646
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume! Haruma-kun?!"
<es>

@1647
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh...!"
<es>

@1650
<en>{Natsume}\n"Papa!"
<es>

@1651
<en>It was Miya-san's voice. We couldn't see his figure, but we heard his voice for sure.
<es>

@1652
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where are you, Miya-san?"
<es>

@1653
<en>Where was he? Where was his voice coming from?
<es>

@1654
<en>{Natsume}\n"He's not on this side. He's contacting us from the other world."
<es>

@1661
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Are you there, Natsume?!"
<es>

@1662
<en>{Natsume}\n"Papa!"
<es>

@1663
<en>The figures of those two appeared in the flask. Amamiya was relieved to see them looking alright, but it was still too early for that.
<es>

@1664
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Were you doing a refinement just now?"
<es>

@1665
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Yes, I'm glad you noticed it. I'm speaking to you through the overlapping space that occurs as part of the refinement. It was a gamble, but I'm glad it worked."
<es>

@1666
<en>It was a specific form of communication that could only occur inside the flask connecting the two worlds during an experiment.
<es>

@1667
<en>In other words, it wasn't alchemy being used to create something new but to overlap the two worlds.
<es>

@1668
<en>It was just an emergency measure, and luckily it actually worked.
<es>

@1669
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Everybody here is helping me, but it's unstable and I don't think it'll last."
<es>

@1670
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Everybody?"
<es>

@1673
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Yes. Everybody is giving me a hand."
<es>

@1674
<en>Amamiya kept looking at the flame, his forehead covered in sweat. I could see him concentrating a great deal on the experiment.
<es>

@1677
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Ngh..."
<es>

@1678
<en>Amamiya groaned.
<es>

@1679
<en>Then we heard noise in the feed, and the image of the two got blurred.
<es>

@1683
<en>{Appo}\n"Hey, the flame's going out!"
<es>

@1688
<en>{Pierre}\n"You fix it! I'm too busy with this!!"
<es>

@1692
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey! Don't fight! It causes bad reception."
<es>

@1696
<en>{Haruka}\n"Pay attention, everybody! Focus on nothing but the two of them!!"
<es>

@1697
<en>Everybody was in the laboratory. Kazushi's friends, Natsume's classmates...
<es>

@1698
<en>Everybody was praying for their return.
<es>

@1699
<en>Their strong wish worked as a bridge between us and them, at least.
<es>

@1703
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi-kun, get back here! We all want you to return!"
<es>

@1708
<en>{Daigo}\n"Don't forget you still owe me a hundred yen! You got to come back for that."
<es>

@1709
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Everybody's there, huh?"
<es>

@1710
<en>Haruka and Kazushi's classmates...
<es>

@1713
<en>{Tanaka Kaoruko}\n"Natsume, I've cooked some delicious stuff for you, so come home soon!"
<es>

@1714
<en>{Hanako}\n"We promised we were going to go to the new sweet shop together!"
<es>

@1715

<es>

@1716

<es>

@1719
<en>{Panchu}\n"Hey, Ka'ushi!"
<es>

@1720
<en>{Kazushi}\n"P-Panchu-sempai! H-hey!"
<es>

@1723
<en>{Panchu}\n"I'm 'un'ry. Go 'uy me 'ome 'read."
<es>

@1724
<en>{Kazushi}\n"S-sure, I'll get right on it!"
<es>

@1725
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan, we're in trouble! We have to get back quick!!"
<es>

@1726
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, a gofer...?"
<es>

@1729
<en>{Panchu}\n"I'm 'i''ing."
<es>

@1730

<es>

@1738
<en>{Mei}\n"Haruma-kun, Amamiya-san. Are you both unhurt?"
<es>

@1739
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh, Yagi-sensei, we're fine."
<es>

@1743
<en>{Yagami}\n"Kazushi, you're a man, so make sure you protect Amamiya. I hope to see you both in good health, soon."
<es>

@1744
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, I will."
<es>

@1746
<en>Panchu, Yagami, Mei, and the other teachers... They were all waiting for Kazushi and Natsume to come back.
<es>

@1750
<en>Everybody wanted us to come back, and cooperated in helping us with our return.
<es>

@1751
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks, guys."
<es>

@1752
<en>{Appo}\n"What's that for? If you have time for that shit, why don't you hurry up and get back here?"
<es>

@1753
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ggh, I know."
<es>

@1754
<en>{Pierre}\n"Natsume-chaaan! Come back to us soon!"
<es>

@1755
<en>{Sakura}\n"We miss you Natsume-chan!!! Come cosplay with me again!"
<es>

@1756
<en>{Natsume}\n"No thank you, but I'll be back soon."
<es>

@1757
<en>Natsume-chan smiled at their encouraging words.
<es>

@1758
<en>{Amamiya}\n"So, tell me about the situation over there."
<es>

@1761
<en>{Natsume}\n"We're completely closed in. There's no way out... Can you do anything about it?"
<es>

@1762
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It's not easy. Unlike your time, we don't even have your bodies here. You've been sucked in completely."
<es>

@1763
<en>{Amamiya}\n"We can barely communicate now by doing our best."
<es>

@1764
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? I think I have no choice but to destroy this world."
<es>

@1765
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Destroy? Do you have some kind of plan?"
<es>

@1768
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma thinks he can destroy this world."
<es>

@1769
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What? You mean... destroy it?"
<es>

@1770
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think that's the only way left for us to get out of this place."
<es>

@1771
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Yes, you may be right..."
<es>

@1772
<en>{Haruka}\n"Is it possible to do that?"
<es>

@1773
<en>{Mei}\n"'Destroy the world' sounds a little too abstract."
<es>

@1774
<en>{Ran}\n"It's like destroying this Earth, right?"
<es>

@1775
<en>{Daigo}\n"That's impossible."
<es>

@1776
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, it's not as difficult as you think. We just need to destroy this thing."
<es>

@1777
<en>There was a red stone shining with a golden hue in front of my eyes. That was all I needed to break.
<es>

@1778
<en>And no, there was no logic to that.
<es>

@1779
<en>Just somehow I was confident about that.
<es>

@1780
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Kazushi... What's that stone for?"
<es>

@1781
<en>{Principal}\n"Is there a stone before you?!"
<es>

@1782
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh...?"
<es>

@1783
<en>Suddenly, I heard an unexpected voice.
<es>

@1784
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hisae..."
<es>

@1788
<en>{Principal}\n"Is there a stone there?"
<es>

@1789
<en>Hisae finally broke her silence and uttered a question. Before that, she was sitting down in the corner of the room like a dead person.
<es>

@1790
<en>She straightened her body all of a sudden and spoke to Kazushi.
<es>

@1795
<en>{Haruka}\n"Are you okay, Grandma?"
<es>

@1798
<en>{Principal}\n"I'm fine. Anyway, tell me more about the stone."
<es>

@1799
<en>Hisae seemed to care a great deal about the stone.
<es>

@1800
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There is one here."
<es>

@1801
<en>{Principal}\n"Can you tell me what kind of stone?"
<es>

@1802
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um..."
<es>

@1805
<en>Hisae listened carefully as Kazushi told her about its characteristics.
<es>

@1808
<en>{Principal}\n"I see. There's no mistaking it."
<es>

@1809
<en>Hisae nodded deeply at the same time as Amamiya's face went pale.
<es>

@1815
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Is it possible that they have the stone which was lost from the island a long time ago?"
<es>

@1816
<en>{Haruka}\n"Is it the one you've been looking for since then, grandma?"
<es>

@1817
<en>That rang a bell for Amamiya and Haruka. Both of them were surprised.
<es>

@1822
<en>{Principal}\n"Yes, that is the stone which should have been sleeping under this island, lost together with that man. It is this island's black box of alchemy."
<es>

@1823
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Black box?"
<es>

@1824
<en>{Principal}\n"The reason the alchemy was so successful on this island is because of that stone."
<es>

@1829
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The stone inside Natsume was a fabrication of that stone. It is was merely a replica, and the one you see before you is the original."
<es>

@1830
<en>{Natsume}\n"I see. This stone is..."
<es>

@1831
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't know this stone was so special."
<es>

@1832
<en>{Principal}\n"And I think that it's the source of power which keeps the world together over there."
<es>

@1833
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That means this world'll disappear if I break it, right?"
<es>

@1834
<en>{Natsume}\n"Then we can come home?"
<es>

@1837
<en>Hisae paused for their questions, but she didn't seem to know how to answer them.
<es>

@1838
<en>Finally, she nodded.
<es>

@1841
<en>{Principal}\n"If you could break the stone, the world would probably disappear."
<es>

@1842
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I thought so."
<es>

@1843
<en>{Principal}\n"However, I don't know if you'll be able to come back here or not, even if you are successful in your attempt."
<es>

@1844
<en>{Principal}\n"I think the chances are in your favor, but I cannot say it won't be dangerous."
<es>

@1845
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's still worth trying... Well, really it's the only chance we have left."
<es>

@1846
<en>{Principal}\n"That's right."
<es>

@1847
<en>Hisae sounded very sad about their final option.
<es>

@1852
<en>{Haruka}\n"Are you sure they can break that stone, Grandma?"
<es>

@1853
<en>Haruka wanted to make sure of it, noticing Hisae's feelings.
<es>

@1854
<en>{Principal}\n"..............."
<es>

@1855
<en>Hisae became contemplative when Haruka said so.
<es>

@1856
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not supposed to be broken, is it?"
<es>

@1857
<en>{Natsume}\n"Is this stone that important to you?"
<es>

@1862
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae has been looking for that for a long time, and she needs its power."
<es>

@1867
<en>{Haruka}\n"It is very important to my Grandma. It would be great if you could find your way back without destroying it."
<es>

@1868
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see. But if I don't break this then..."
<es>

@1871
<en>Kazushi was lost in thought. Nobody seemed to have a better idea, and silence quickly prevailed.
<es>

@1874
<en>{Principal}\n"No, please destroy the stone."
<es>

@1875
<en>Ultimately, it was Hisae who broke the silence.
<es>

@1876
<en>{Principal}\n"Please destroy the stone and come back here."
<es>

@1882
<en>{Haruka}\n"Grandma, are you sure?"
<es>

@1883
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You've been looking for the stone for years, haven't you? You stirred up such a great fuss over it today......"
<es>

@1884
<en>Hisae smiled at the two who registered such concern about her feelings.
<es>

@1889
<en>{Principal}\n"It doesn't matter anymore. It probably is the only way that they can come back here."
<es>

@1892
<en>{Principal}\n"Besides, I feel like he wants this as well. Like he wants them to destroy that stone."
<es>

@1893
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm, so is it okay to break it?"
<es>

@1894
<en>{Principal}\n"Yes. Go ahead and damage it as much as you want."
<es>

@1895
<en>{Natsume}\n"You can't change your mind later, though."
<es>

@1898
<en>{Principal}\n"Of course I won't. I'm just not sure it's going to be that easy to destroy it."
<es>

@1899
<en>{Principal}\n"Do you think you can do it?"
<es>

@1900
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure, we can."
<es>

@1901
<en>Surprisingly, Kazushi replied with confidence.
<es>

@1902
<en>{Natsume}\n"Do you know you're giving her a rash promise?"
<es>

@1903
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I feel like I can manage it."
<es>

@1904
<en>Kazushi sounded like he had confidence. Hisae believed him, even though she didn't see any basis for his words.
<es>

@1906
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, we're going to break it now. I think it might be best for you to stop the burner over there."
<es>

@1909
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You're right, it may have some influence here otherwise. But you should know that once we disable the burner, we'll lose communication."
<es>

@1910
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I know. We'll talk when we get home."
<es>

@1911
<en>That was very impressive. Kazushi was confident in their ability to return.
<es>

@1915
<en>{Appo}\n"I'll take a nap and wait for you guys."
<es>

@1916
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, we'll be there soon."
<es>

@1920
<en>{Principal}\n"Well, take care of the rest, okay?"
<es>

@1921
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We sure will. We'll be there, and you'll pay whatever compensation you owe us."
<es>

@1923
<en>Kazushi replied reliably. Hisae wore a slight smile on her face. She was certain they would do it.
<es>

@1924
<en>She wanted to believe that.
<es>

@1926
<en>As soon as our communication was blocked, the world fell silent.
<es>

@1927
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, let's finish this up quickly and go home."
<es>

@1930
<en>{Natsume}\n"How can you be so confident about this, Haruma?"
<es>

@1931
<en>Natsume-chan couldn't figure out why I was acting so full of confidence - it must've looked weird to her.
<es>

@1934
<en>{Natsume}\n"You made that rash promise with Hisae, but can you really destroy the stone? In case you didn't know, this is the greatest mystery created by alchemy."
<es>

@1935
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that so? No wonder the principal seemed like she didn't want me to break it."
<es>

@1936
<en>But I still didn't have a choice. Unless we destroyed the stone, we'd never destroy this world either.
<es>

@1937
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know I have to do it no matter what. And yes, that is my final answer."
<es>

@1940
<en>{Natsume}\n"I agree with you. This place feels like a jail, and looks like a person I hate."
<es>

@1941
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A person you hate?"
<es>

@1944
<en>{Natsume}\n"That and this place makes me feel very sad."
<es>

@1945
<en>I knew what she was trying to say. This was a sad place - maybe that's why I wanted to destroy it.
<es>

@1946
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, are you ready?"
<es>

@1947
<en>We faced the stone at the same time. Before I knew it, Natsume-chan was holding her katana.
<es>

@1949
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I still wonder why this thing exists."
<es>

@1950
<en>The stone's glow pulsed, as if it was breathing.
<es>

@1953
<en>{Natsume}\n"All I know is that some alchemist created it."
<es>

@1954
<en>She carefully stared at the stone.
<es>

@1957
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's well made. It must have been synthesized by a famous alchemist, but why keep it hidden below the school?"
<es>

@1958
<en>Based on her amazed look, Natsume-chan obviously thought the stone was invaluable.
<es>

@1959
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't understand why that distinguished alchemist would create a sad world like this and not a happy one."
<es>

@1962
<en>{Natsume}\n"It might've been different people who made the stone and then built this sad world."
<es>

@1963
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Really?"
<es>

@1966
<en>{Natsume}\n"That's the feeling I get. This stone just brought somebody's dream to life."
<es>

@1967
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@1968
<en>It could make dreams come true, so why would that person want to make such a sad world?
<es>

@1969
<en>He could be a very sad person like this world.
<es>

@1972
<en>{Natsume}\n"If we utilize this carefully, it could make your dream come true, Haruma."
<es>

@1973
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No thanks."
<es>

@1974
<en>All I wanted was to go back to where I belonged with Natsume-chan. I didn't care about the stone, so long as I could achieve that.
<es>

@1975
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What about you? If you want a dream to come true, why not ask it before we break it?"
<es>

@1978
<en>{Natsume}\n"No thanks."
<es>

@1979
<en>Natsume-chan also shook her head, a slight smile on her face.
<es>

@1980
<en>{Natsume}\n"I already have someone who can make my dream come true."
<es>

@1981
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You do? Who?"
<es>

@1984
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's..."
<es>

@1985
<en>Her cheeks blushed, and she closed her lips without continuing her words.
<es>

@1986
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, come on! Don't leave me hanging."
<es>

@1987
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'll tell you when we get home."
<es>

@1988
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay."
<es>

@1989
<en>Then...
<es>

@1990
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's go home. To everyone!"
<es>

@1993
<en>{Natsume}\n"Can we really make it?"

<es>

@1995
<en>If I was the only one to live here, it wasn't worth thinking about, but we'd be together, so it didn't sound all bad.
<es>

@1996
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah, I wouldn't be lonely if you were with me."
<es>

@1997
<en>It would be great for us if we could go back, but if we couldn't make it, we'd still be okay together. It was an easy bet.
<es>

@1998
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, we had so much cheerfulness before. I'm sure it'll be quieter with just the two of us."
<es>

@1999
<en>{Natsume}\n"So in the worst case scenario, we give birth and make more."
<es>

@2000
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Give birth?"
<es>

@2001
<en>{Natsume}\n"Here we are, man and woman. That might very well be all we need."
<es>

@2002
<en>The alchemy of fusing male and female elements to give birth to something new, huh?
<es>

@2003
<en>It's natural for men and women to do that.
<es>

@2004
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay! Then we'll give birth!"
<es>

@2005
<en>{Natsume}\n"You idiot! That's only if we can't go back. Don't prioritize it!"
<es>

@2006
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that's right."
<es>

@2007
<en>I put my hand on hers, tightening her grip on the sword.
<es>

@2008
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's like cutting a wedding cake together."
<es>

@2009
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's our first joint deed. I know most married couples have done things like this all the time by the time they're wed."

<en>{Natsume}\n"'Virgin road' makes you laugh, doesn't it?"
<es>

@2011
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't throw a wet blanket over this!"
<es>

@2012
<en>We raised our hands, slowly.
<es>

@2013
<en>{Natsume}\n"Can we break it?"
<es>

@2014
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course we can."
<es>

@2015
<en>I hesitated no longer. For a moment, I saw ahead and glimpsed the stone already cut in half.
<es>

@2016
<en>It's strange, time didn't exist in this world, but I saw the future.
<es>

@2017
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you ready now?"
<es>

@2018
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah!"
<es>

@2019
<en>We didn't overstrain ourselves. We just banged down our hands with force.
<es>

@2020
<en>The sword slid straight into the black stone.
<es>

@2023
<en>Suddenly, an explosion of light filled my entire vision.
<es>

@2024
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh... Whoaa!!"
<es>

@2025
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma!!"
<es>

@2026
<en>We grabbed each other's hands tightly, refusing to let go.
<es>

@2027
<en>A torrent of light encircled us.
<es>

@2030
<en>I realized that the two of us were all that remained of this world, and even the school building had gone.
<es>

@2031
<en>There was a carpet of flowers all around us, and we were standing there by ourselves, hand in hand.
<es>

@2032
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What just happened?"
<es>

@2033
<en>Did I fail? Did the alternative world become a real world for just the two of us?
<es>

@2036
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@2039
<en>Natsume-chan muttered, as she looked at the sky.
<es>

@2041
<en>*CRACK...*
<es>

@2042
<en>I heard a cracking sound.
<es>

@2043
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@2046
<en>I muttered in a pitiful voice. As I looked at the sky, I saw a spider's web of cracks, a series of black lines cutting through the brilliant blue.
<es>

@2047
<en>*CRACK, CRACK...*
<es>

@2048
<en>The cracks were getting bigger, and light was pouring through the gaps.
<es>

@2049
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The sky's cracking in half..."
<es>

@2050
<en>The stream of light burst through as the cracking sound continued.
<es>

@2053
<en>*Creak... creak...*
<es>

@2054
<en>The sky creaked against itself. As it continued filling with cracks, light flowed out across the sky.
<es>

@2055
<en>Then...
<es>

@2059
<en>The sky split with a loud crack. Then, like a boiled egg, the broken shell began to peel away.
<es>

@2060
<en>{Natsume}\n"It really looks like an egg. No wonder it's called a philosopher's egg."
<es>

@2061
<en>A Philosopher's Stone. The flask used for alchemy. The early alchemists thought of it as an egg.
<es>

@2062
<en>I figured there must be some kind of reason for it.
<es>

@2063
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess the world might look like an egg."
<es>

@2064
<en>The fragments of the peeling sky fluttered to the ground like snow.
<es>

@2065
<en>{Natsume}\n"The sky is falling. It's like snow."
<es>

@2066
<en>It looked like snow falling from the sky, but it was actually flower petals.
<es>

@2067
<en>The flower petals were falling down one after another, piling up on the ground.
<es>

@2068
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's beautiful..."
<es>

@2069
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, it is beautiful. But what's gonna happen after this?"
<es>

@2070
<en>The stopped world was crumbling apart. The world that had been perfect was crumbling away.
<es>

@2071
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's over. This sealed off world has lost its balance and will soon disappear."
<es>

@2072
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@2073
<en>The sky looked golden. I could see the morning sun beyond the crumbling sky.
<es>

@2074
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Think everyone's there, beyond the sky?"
<es>

@2075
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah, I think so."
<es>

@2076
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right. Then..."
<es>

@2077
<en>I threw the dangerous sword away, and gripped Natsume-chan's hand again.
<es>

@2078
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's go."
<es>

@2079
<en>I smiled at her, pulling her hand. Her smile shone bright as it bathed in the morning sun.
<es>

@2080
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's head home to everyone."
<es>

@2081
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes!"
