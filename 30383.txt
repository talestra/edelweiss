<en>{Ran}\n"Wait here."
<es>

@9
<en>Ran ran out of the room, half-naked.
<es>

@10
<en>In the meantime, I started putting my clothes back on. A few minutes later...
<es>

@13
<en>{Ran}\n"Okay, here it is."
<es>

@14
<en>Ran came back in fully dressed.
<es>

@15
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, you put your clothes on..."
<es>

@16
<en>Was it that special issue women have with not minding being seen naked during sex, but embarrassed when changing?
<es>

@17
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, I was doing some other things too. I had to prepare our experiment."
<es>

@18
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Experiment?"
<es>

@19
<en>Talking about our experiment right after sex? Ran quickly turned to the furnace where the flask was already nice and warm.
<es>

@20
<en>{Ran}\n"Here we are. This is our key this time."
<es>

@21
<en>Ran was holding a test tube with a white, slimy liquid at the bottom of it. The substance in question looked rather familiar...
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, is that by any chance my...?"
<es>

@23
<en>Sperm?
<es>

@26
<en>{Ran}\n"Bingo!!"
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Figures. Then you... spiked my lunch just for this?"
<es>

@28
<en>Because she wanted my sperm?
<es>

@31
<en>{Ran}\n"Initially I was just gonna drug you, but it turned out that I screwed up and let myself go under the influence as well."
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Look, just tell me that in the first place. Don't stay quiet about it."
<es>

@35
<en>{Ran}\n"I can't just say "Sperm, please!" I mean, wouldn't you get turned off by a girl who asks that kind of question?"
<es>

@36
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well..... you've got a point."
<es>

@37
<en>Sex is nice, and a girl who's a little horny is fun for all, but being asked for sperm is different. It could be taken as a desire for kids, which is frightening.
<es>

@40
<en>{Ran}\n"Right? So my plan was to get you too horny to hold back and then I'd be kind and suck it out."
<es>

@43
<en>{Ran}\n"A blowjob's supposed to be 3,000 yen, too. I didn't think you'd forget your wallet."
<es>

@44
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see, you thought it out. ...Wait, no you didn't. You needed it for our refinement, right? If you'd just told me that upfront I'd have been fine."
<es>

@47
<en>{Ran}\n"Because... I'm a young girl too! It's hard to ask for a guy's sperm."
<es>

@48
<en>Ran shouted, red in the face. That was her real reason.
<es>

@49
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So that's why."
<es>

@50
<en>She was just embarrassed. What a cute girl she is!
<es>

@53
<en>{Ran}\n"But will this work? You went and came inside me so now my juices are mixed in too."
<es>

@54
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, Ran, you said you wanted me to-"
<es>

@57
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah-ah-ah! Oh, Kazushi! You went and came inside me on your own!"
<es>

@58
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whatever..."
<es>

@61
<en>Was she embarrassed about this too? She was becoming more and more embarrassed about a lot of things...
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you really need that kind of stuff for alchemy?"
<es>

@65
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah, it's a really popular source material. They often used to use stuff like blood, sperm, pee, poo, and any other kind of bodily fluid."
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yuck. Really? It sounds different from the alchemy we study in class."
<es>

@67
<en>The impression I got from class was much more casual, like instant food.
<es>

@68
<en>{Ran}\n"That's because the alchemy we study here is a special branch. This island has a very special alchemic power of its own, and we use that."
<es>

@71
<en>{Ran}\n"It means that we can skip a ton of prep work and refine things efficiently. Nevertheless, I still can't get things to work."
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A special power of this island..."
<es>

@73
<en>No wonder it was so easy. I wasn't talented or anything, it's just that everything was already in place to do it easily.
<es>

@74
<en>But come to think of it, this island DOES have a special power. I can feel it from time to time.
<es>

@75
<en>What a mysterious place this island is.
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, how are you gonna use my sperm?"
<es>

@77
<en>{Ran}\n"Just mix it in. I'll mix it with the other materials and refine it."
<es>

@79
<en>Ran poured my sperm into the heated flask.
<es>

@81
<en>With a steaming sound, a white smoke started to drift out of the flask.
<es>

@84
<en>{Ran}\n"Whoa! Kazushi's sperm is in full swing!! Yeah!"
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Full swing, huh?"
<es>

@88
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, who knows?"
<es>

@89
<en>Ran stared of the flask, which was showing no signs of change.
<es>

@90
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's gonna happen next?"
<es>

@93
<en>{Ran}\n"No idea. Something should be happening, though. It's because your sperm and I have perfect chemistry."
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Perfect chemistry? You and my sperm?"
<es>

@95
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes."
<es>

@96
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Chemistry between you and my sperm? I don't know about that..."
<es>

@99
<en>{Ran}\n"But..."
<es>

@100
<en>Ran pouted like a sulky kid. Then it hit me.
<es>

@101
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does this have to do with what Fuusen said to you?"
<es>

@110
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You've got to have the right chemistry, you know? I don't think anyone can beat us there, though."
<es>

@113
<en>{Ran}\n"Grr..."
<es>

@114
<en>Huh? Ran seems upset...
<es>

@120
<en>Clearly, Ran was annoyed by Fuusen's comment.
<es>

@121
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're so cute..."
<es>

@124
<en>{Ran}\n"Cute? I was really frustrated."
<es>

@125
<en>Ran looked away and blushed slightly. The way she looked turned me on again.
<es>

@128
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah! No, that's it for today!"
<es>

@129
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't say that, just a little..."
<es>

@130
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah, hey!"
<es>

@133
<en>*gurglegurlge*
<es>

@134
<en>Then we heard a strange sound.
<es>

@137
<en>{Ran}\n"What?"
<es>

@142
<en>The flask was making large bubbles. Something was about to happen. Nothing like this had ever happened with one of Ran's experiments.
<es>

@144
<en>This is no time for fucking!
<es>

@147
<en>{Ran}\n"It's coming. It's coming! We're a perfect match - Kazushi's sperm and me!"
<es>

@148
<en>Ran seemed overjoyed with the situation. I liked her with such an innocent look on her face.
<es>

@149
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If this works out, it's gonna be your first successful experiment, huh?"
<es>

@152
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes! I'm gonna turn all the world's lead into gold! Then lead'll become valuable!"
<es>

@153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahaha, what's the point in that?"
<es>

@154
<en>{Ran}\n"Won't it finish soon? What's gonna happen?"
<es>

@155
<en>Ran was so happy even though she wasn't talking about money. I'd never seen her so thrilled.
<es>

@158
<en>*crack*
<es>

@159
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@160
<en>I heard a cracking sound. I looked around, but the flask still seemed to be OK on the fire.
<es>

@161
<en>Ran was still staring at the flask as if nothing happened.
<es>

@162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did you hear that? It sounded like something cracking."
<es>

@165
<en>{Ran}\n"No. I didn't hear anything."
<es>

@166
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I heard it clearly. It sounded like something cracking."
<es>

@169
<en>*crack*
<es>

@170
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Again!"
<es>

@171
<en>I heard it again. The sound was crystal clear, but nothing seemed to be happening to either the flask or the windows.
<es>

@174
<en>{Ran}\n"What's the matter, Kazushi? I don't hear anything."
<es>

@175
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I heard it clearly. What's..."
<es>

@178
<en>I looked at the furnace again and questioned my eyes.
<es>

@179
<en>There was a crack in space between the flask and the wall.
<es>

@180
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is that?"
<es>

@183
<en>{Ran}\n"What's what?"
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Look! Right above the flask it's cracking."
<es>

@187
<en>{Ran}\n"What? I can't see it well."
<es>

@188
<en>Ran squinted at it and shook her head.
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean you can't see it? Look, it's so clear..."
<es>

@192
<en>{Ran}\n"Aahh!!"
<es>

@193
<en>Suddenly Ran screamed out in terror. It wasn't the flask cracking up, but the wall next to us.
<es>

@194
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wahhhh!?"
<es>

@197
<en>The roots coming through the walls started growing, crawling around like a snake, and growing even faster.
<es>

@201
<en>{Ran}\n"Over there!"
<es>

@202
<en>The plants were growing like in time-lapse from the floor and ceiling.
<es>

@203
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's going on?"
<es>

@204
<en>{Ran}\n"No clue. But it looks kinda bad, doesn't it?"
<es>

@205
<en>{Kazushi}\n"'Kinda'? It's hardcore bad."
<es>

@206
<en>The crack in the space above the flask was getting big. It looked like something was going to be born from it...
<es>

@207
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is definitely not good. Something crazy is gonna happen."
<es>

@208
<en>{Ran}\n"Wh-what do we do?"
<es>

@214
<en>{Ran}\n"Kyaaah?!"
<es>

@215
<en>This time it was Ran's turn to hear the cracking sound. I would hope she did, since the flask itself cracked, and the liquid inside started seeping out.
<es>

@216
<en>Shit... It's gonna break!
<es>

@217
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran, this way!"
<es>

@219
<en>I pulled Ran into me and turned us away from the flask.
<es>

@222
<en>We heard the glass exploding into fragments.
<es>

@223
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ow..."
<es>

@224
<en>I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder. It must have been pierced by some of the shrapnel. In no time, my shirt was soaked with blood.
<es>

@227
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!"
<es>

@228
<en>Ran looked up at me and noticed the injury on my shoulder.
<es>

@231
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh no... you're bleeding."
<es>

@232
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry about it. We've got to do something about the lab first."
<es>

@233
<en>{Ran}\n"But..."
<es>

@234
<en>*Drip...drip...*
<es>

@235
<en>My blood dripped onto the floor, leaving splotches. I hadn't thought it was that bad. A puddle was forming at my feet.
<es>

@238
<en>{Ran}\n"No way. This looks pretty bad, Kazushi. We've got to stop the bleeding."
<es>

@239
<en>*Drip, drip... drip, drip...*
<es>

@240
<en>The puddle at my feet grew larger. Was I bleeding that badly? I thought it was just a scratch.
<es>

@241
<en>*Drip...*
<es>

@242
<en>Ah...
<es>

@245
<en>Suddenly I lost consciousness.
<es>

@247
<en>The next moment, I was the puddle. Though it was bigger than a puddle, more like, yes, like a spring.
<es>

@248
<en>{Ran}\n"K-Kazushi? Huh? Where are you?"
<es>

@249
<en>Ran looked around, but it seemed like she can't see me.
<es>

@250
<en>I wanted to tell her where I was, but I couldn't say anything.
<es>

@254
<en>{Ran}\n"What's this pond? Why did Kazushi disappear and this pond appear?"
<es>

@255
<en>Suddenly bubbles appeared on the surface of the pond.
<es>

@257
<en>*SPLASH*
<es>

@260
<en>{Ran}\n"Hhh?!"
<es>

@266
<en>Something was floating up from the spring. It was a beautiful, glowing woman. She was a fairy of the spring.
<es>

@268
<en>{Ran}\n"Wh-who are you? A foreigner?"
<es>

@269
<en>Ran asked something completely off-mark. The fairy of the spring paid no heed and spread her arms out. Two new people appeared from her frilly clothes.
<es>

@276
<en>One was a golden me, the other a silver me. What the hell? What is this world?
<es>

@282
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh? What? K-Kazushi?"
<es>

@289
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Was the object you dropped this Golden Kazushi? Or was it this Silver Kazushi?"
<es>

@290
<en>The fairy of the spring asked Ran with a gentle voice. Ran stared at them vacantly.
<es>

@296
<en>{Ran}\n"Golden Kazushi? Silver Kazushi?"
<es>

@297
<en>Ran appraised the me on the right with the one on the left. She looked at the golden me more than the other.
<es>

@300
<en>{Ran}\n"Uhh... Is this that fairy tale? Where you get whichever one you say you dropped?"
<es>

@301
<en>Ran stood there in a daze for a while before finally realizing her situation. Then her answer was obvious. The real me was sinking to the bottom of the spring.
<es>

@308
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"The Golden Kazushi? Or the Silver Kazushi?"
<es>

@314
<en>{Ran}\n"Uhh..."
<es>

@315
<en>{Ran}\n"Golden?"
<es>

@316
<en>What?! That's not the right answer!
<es>

@319
<en>{Ran}\n"No, maybe silver? When choosing between the large and small basket, you have to not be greedy and pick the small one, right?"
<es>

@320
<en>Uh, no, aren't you forgetting something far more important?
<es>

@327
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Is the Silver Kazushi your answer?"
<es>

@333
<en>{Ran}\n"Uh, umm... Oh, sorry! I'll go with the golden one! The one I dropped was the Golden Kazushi!!"
<es>

@334
<en>..................
<es>

@337
<en>{Ran}\n"If I can end up getting exactly what I said and silvers is silver then I'd regret it! I'm gonna be honest and bet on gold!!"
<es>

@338
<en>Is she trying to persuade herself? Isn't there something a bit more important here?
<es>

@345
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Then are you sure it's the Golden Kazushi?"
<es>

@351
<en>{Ran}\n"Positive! Give me Golden Kazushi!!"
<es>

@352
<en>............For fuck's sake.
<es>

@356
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Then I shall return the Golden Kazushi to you."
<es>

@357
<en>The fairy of the spring tossed the Golden Kazushi to Ran. It landed on the floor with a heavy thud.
<es>

@363
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow!! Is this solid gold? It looks so heavy!! I'm super lucky!!"
<es>

@364
<en>You're dancing with delight? You're lucky? Is that how it is?
<es>

@365
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, look! It's a Golden Kazushi! I wonder how much this is worth?"
<es>

@366
<en>You know I'm not there...
<es>

@369
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh? Kazushi?"
<es>

@370
<en>Ran's finally realized I wasn't there. She looked around the room to find me.
<es>

@371
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi! I got the gold Kazushi! Where are you?"
<es>

@372
<en>{Ran}\n"Uhh... huh?"
<es>

@373
<en>Ran realized something was wrong and put her hand on her forehead as she thought.
<es>

@377
<en>{Ran}\n"...............Ah?! D-did I just make a huge mistake?!"
<es>

@378
<en>{Ran}\n"Was I supposed to not choose neither gold nor silver, but say, 'The one I dropped was the regular Kazushi'?"
<es>

@379
<en>Now you get it.
<es>

@382
<en>{Ran}\n"Gaaaaaaaaaaaah! What do I do?!"
<es>

@383
<en>At the same time, she realized that it was too late to change her mind. Ran went pale.
<es>

@386
<en>{Ran}\n"Look! I'll return this gold Kazushi to you, so please give me back the ordinary Kazushi."
<es>

@390
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Sorry, we have a no-return policy."
<es>

@394
<en>{Ran}\n"What's with that insulting tone! Who do you think you are?! Give me back my Kazushi!"
<es>

@398
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Me no speak English."
<es>

@402
<en>{Ran}\n"You've been speaking it just fine! Quit playing dumb and give me back Kazushi! Come on, please!"
<es>

@406
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Good bye."
<es>

@408
<en>And with that, the Fairy of the Spring disappeared.
<es>

@411
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh no, you're kidding me?! I'm really serious! Give me back my Kazushi!"
<es>

@412
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, hey! You didn't ask me if that was my final answer, did you? So I should have another chance!"
<es>

@415
<en>{Ran}\n"Come on, quit joking! Give him back! Give me back my Kazushi!"
<es>

@416
<en>Despite Ran's desperate cries, there was no sign of the Fairy of the Spring reappearing. She didn't even know whether her voice was being heard.
<es>

@417
<en>{Ran}\n"Please!! You can take anything I have!!"
<es>

@418
<en>Ran kept screaming out. Her cries echoed over the sky.
<es>

@421
<en>*splash*
<es>

@424
<en>Then the Fairy of the Spring reappeared.
<es>

@428
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah, g-give him back! Please give me back Kazushi!"
<es>

@433
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Then I will take the next most important thing to you."
<es>

@437
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh...?"
<es>

@438
<en>The Fairy of the Spring swung her arms, fluttering her dress.
<es>

@440
<en>*SNAP*
<es>

@443
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah!!"
<es>

@444
<en>The shoulder strap from Ran's purse suddenly snapped. Her purse flew across the room and landed in the Fairy of the Spring's hands.
<es>

@445
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah, wait! You're taking that?! That's my--!"
<es>

@449
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"I will now return the ordinary Kazushi."
<es>

@450
<en>The Fairy of the Spring wasn't listening to Ran. She just carried out their contract.
<es>

@451
<en>The Lake Fairy swung her arms hard again.
<es>

@452
<en>Ah...
<es>

@453
<en>I felt like my consciousness was rapidly rising to the surface. No, my body was too. They rushed up, and...
<es>

@455
<en>*Splash*
<es>

@456
<en>I burst through the surface of the lake and back into the lab room.
<es>

@461
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah! Kazushi!!"
<es>

@462
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uwah?!"
<es>

@463
<en>{Ran}\n"Watch out!!"
<es>

@464
<en>I was tossed out soaking wet. Ran caught me head on, throwing us both down to the floor.
<es>

@465
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Owww..."
<es>

@466
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Are you alive?"
<es>

@467
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah... I'm fine..."
<es>

@470
<en>{Ran}\n"Th-that's great!"
<es>

@471
<en>Ran sighed with relief as she held me. But seeing as how she picked the gold Kazushi first, I had mixed feelings...
<es>

@475
<en>{Fairy of the Spring}\n"Then as promised, I will take this."
<es>

@479
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahh. Wait!"
<es>

@481
<en>*gurgle*
<es>

@482
<en>With Ran's purse in her hand, the Fairy of the Spring sank back to the bottom of her spring.
<es>

@485
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahh, my money! My--!!"
<es>

@486
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait! Calm down!!"
<es>

@488
<en>I stopped Ran as she tried to jump into the spring as if she were possessed. The spring's surface began to bubble.
<es>

@489
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, watch out!"
<es>

@490
<en>{Ran}\n"Wah! Wh-what?"
<es>

@491
<en>The spring began to bubble as if it was boiling and steam wafted from it.
<es>

@492
<en>{Ran}\n"What is this!?"
<es>

@493
<en>The steam was blinding me completely.
<es>

@501
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@502
<en>Within a split second, we found ourselves back in the lab.
<es>

@505
<en>{Ran}\n"H-huh? Where's that pond? Or that crazy foreigner?"
<es>

@506
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They're gone."
<es>

@509
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, no way? My money! Ah!!"
<es>

@510
<en>Ran's purse was lying at her feet. She happily picked it up.
<es>

@513
<en>{Ran}\n"Thank God...Was it an illusion?"
<es>

@514
<en>She looks inside her purse and the color vanished from her face.
<es>

@515
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's the matter?"
<es>

@518
<en>{Ran}\n"There's nothing in it!!"
<es>

@519
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? How much was in there?"
<es>

@522
<en>{Ran}\n"My entire assets!! She took every last one of my assets!"
<es>

@523
<en>Ran was panicking and pale.
<es>

@524
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All your assets? You kept them all in your purse?"
<es>

@527
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes! All of it! I always kept it on me because I thought that was the only place it would be safe. Your million yen was inside there too!!"
<es>

@528
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?! My one million yen too?!"
<es>

@529
<en>That's not good. If Ran had the money, I could relax knowing that I could just have her return it at some point, but now...
<es>

@532
<en>{Ran}\n"We've got to get the money back!!"
<es>

@533
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's right! But how?"
<es>

@536
<en>{Ran}\n"Why don't we conduct the experiment again from the start... ah!!"
<es>

@539
<en>Ran backed away from the workbench. The fire heating up the flask was turning into a blaze.
<es>

@540
<en>The flames were burning too furiously to get close.
<es>

@541
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Look at it burn..."
<es>

@542
<en>The surge of flame swayed like a living thing and grew bigger and bigger.
<es>

@545
<en>{Ran}\n"What the hell? We can't start over now!"
<es>

@547
<en>Ran started yelling hysterically as the huge flames began to raise the temperature of the room.
<es>

@548
<en>It was if the entire room had become a burner, and thanks to the heat, the plants kept growing.
<es>

@549
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah...A flower..."
<es>

@550
<en>Suddenly the plants begin to sprout flowers. I'd seen these flowers before - the flowers that look like snow crystals.
<es>

@551
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's the flowers that bloomed in that garden."
<es>

@552
<en>They were the same white flowers that were crucial to alchemy which the principal had been carefully raising before we ruined her garden.
<es>

@553
<en>The flames burned on regardless, catching the plants on fire too. The white flowers burst into flames, burning up into black ash.
<es>

@555
<en>As the flowers burned up, purple smoke began to permeate the room.
<es>

@558
<en>{Ran}\n *COUGH* "This smoke is amazing. Give me back my money!"
<es>

@559
<en>Ran tried to make her way through the smoke, but the flames got in her way.
<es>

@562
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, let me through!!"
<es>

@563
<en>She shouted out at the flames.
<es>

@564
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran! Stop it! It's not safe!"
<es>

@565
<en>{Ran}\n"No! That's my money!!"
<es>

@566
<en>Ran tried to thrash her way through the flames.
<es>

@567
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey! Get back!! I'll get it for you!"
<es>

@570
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Are you nuts? It's too dangerous!!"
<es>

@571
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Ran, you were the one trying to go in there!"
<es>

@574
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm fine. It's too dangerous for you, Kazushi!"
<es>

@575
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's your standard for that statement? You're acting crazy. You're the one in danger."
<es>

@576
<en>{Ran}\n"It's too dangerous for you, Kazushi!"
<es>

@577
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, it's too dangerous for you... this isn't the time to argue about that."
<es>

@581
<en>{Ran}\n"Kyaah!"
<es>

@583
<en>The pillars of flame snaked toward us like a dragon.
<es>

@584
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh!!"
<es>

@585
<en>I grabbed Ran and jumped sideways. I could hardly see anything through the smoke and flames.
<es>

@586
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We've got to get out of here!"
<es>

@589
<en>{Ran}\n"Uuuugh, my money..."
<es>

@590
<en>She still wouldn't drop it. But at least she did realize we couldn't stay here any longer.
<es>

@591
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's get out of here, okay?"
<es>

@592
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes..."
<es>

@595
<en>Ran nodded in consent with teary eyes. I set off to run, holding her tight.
<es>

@596
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shit! The door..."
<es>

@597
<en>The door was blocked by the ivy.
<es>

@600
<en>I pounded and kicked at the door, but it wouldn't move an inch.
<es>

@604
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, over there!"
<es>

@605
<en>Ran pointed at the window.
<es>

@606
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's right!"
<es>

@607
<en>We were on the second floor.\nWe should be able to jump down from here - it's better than dying in a fire.
<es>

@610
<en>The pillars of flame continued to leap left and right like a dragon. We managed to slip though and make it to the window. I threw the window open.
<es>

@611
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We're gonna have to jump, Ran!!"
<es>

@614
<en>{Ran}\n"Aahh... My money..."
<es>

@615
<en>Ran turned back to the room with a lingering attachment to her money and tears in her eyes.
<es>

@619
<en>{Ran}\n"Kyah?!"
<es>

@621
<en>The pillars of flame burst behind us.
<es>

@622
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
<es>

@624
<en>I jumped out the window with Ran in my arms.
<es>

@626
<en>KABOOM!!!!
<es>

@627
<en>At that moment, we heard a huge explosion behind us.
<es>

@628
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uwaaah!!"
<es>

@629
<en>{Ran}\n"Kyaaah!!"
<es>

@630
<en>The blast propelled both of us through the air.
<es>

@631
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ngh, uwah!"
<es>

@632
<en>{Ran}\n"Kyaah! Wah, awawah!"
<es>

@642
<en>I rolled along the ground with Ran in my arms until my eyes were spinning, and then we finally stopped.
<es>

@643
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Owww... Ran, are you alright?"
<es>

@647
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes...but..."
<es>

@648
<en>She stared vacantly at the lab room. The black smoke and flames were flickering and licking the walls like a snake's tongue.
<es>

@649
<en>{Ran}\n"It's burning so much. Uugh, my money..."
<es>

@650
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, forget about the money. We're in really deep shit."
<es>

@651
<en>Who'd have thought it would turn into such a disaster. What's gonna happen to us now?"
<es>

@652
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder if we can get off with a suspension?"
<es>

@655
<en>{Ran}\n"Who cares. They can expel us. *sob*..."
<es>

@656
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I care! Don't give up, live on!"
<es>

@660
<en>{Signpost}\n"FIRE! EVACUATE!!"
<es>

@661
<en>Everybody else must have heard the explosion. People started gathering around, and I had a feeling our problems just got bigger.
<es>
