<en>{Ran}\n"You wait here."
<es>

@9
<en>Ran runs out of the room naked.
<es>

@10
<en>In the meantime I put on my clothes. A few minutes later...
<es>

@13
<en>{Ran}\n"I got it."
<es>

@14
<en>Ran came back in fully dressed.
<es>

@15
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, you put on clothing..."
<es>

@16
<en>I heard the women are pretty okay with sex. But when it comes to getting dressed, they feel embarrassed.
<es>

@17
<en>They don't want men to see it. Is that why you were gone?
<es>

@18
<en>{Ran}\n"I was preparing for an experiment."
<es>

@19
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Experiment?"
<es>

@20
<en>She is already talking about the experiment. Right after sex! Ran checks out with a heated flask.
<es>

@21
<en>{Ran}\n"Here it is. This is the substance for this time."
<es>

@22
<en>Ran is holding a test tube. It has a white, slimy liquid at the bottom of it. The substance looks very familiar....
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, is that by any chance, my..?"
<es>

@24
<en>Sperm?
<es>

@27
<en>{Ran}\n"Bingo!!"
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Bingo? Wait a minute! You put the drug in the dish just because of this?"
<es>

@29
<en>Because she wanted my sperm?
<es>

@32
<en>{Ran}\n"Initially, I was gonna to drug only you. But it turned out I was also put under its influence by mistake."
<es>

@33
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Look. Why didn't you tell me about this first?"
<es>

@36
<en>{Ran}\n"I just can't say like "Give me your sperm". I mean...do you like a girl who asks that kind of question?"
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well...You have the point."
<es>

@38
<en>That question may be taken in many ways. She simply wants sex.
<es>

@39
<en>Or maybe, she wants to make my baby?....But wait...Yeah, it'll be a little scary if they directly ask for my sperm.
<es>

@42
<en>{Ran}\n"My plan was to make you feel horny first and want to make love to me. Then, I say "why not"..."
<es>

@45
<en>{Ran}\n"I was even planning to charge you 3.000 yen for a blow job. No wallet was not even plan B."
<es>

@46
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What a sloppy plan you got. You need my sperm for refinement, right? Why didn't you ask me for that directly?"
<es>

@49
<en>{Ran}\n"I told you already. I am a shy, innocent girl. I can't ask "Can I have your sperm?". You know?"
<es>

@50
<en>Ran cries out in anger. I guess she really means it.
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay. I got it."
<es>

@52
<en>She was just embarrassed. What a cute girl she is!
<es>

@55
<en>{Ran}\n"Now I'm not sure if I got what I really needed. Because you came inside me, which I didn't want. Yours may have been mixed with my juice."
<es>

@56
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait, you said you wanted me to come inside you..."
<es>

@59
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow...I can't hear you....I said no, but you came inside."
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whatever..."
<es>

@63
<en>Is she embarrassed about this too? She is becoming more and more embarrassed by a lot of things...
<es>

@64
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you really need that kind of stuff for alchemy?"
<es>

@67
<en>{Ran}\n"This is one of the popular materials. For experiments, they use a lot of stuff from our bodies like blood, sperm, pee, poop, and all kinds of body fluid."
<es>

@68
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? It sounds different from the alchemy I studied at school."
<es>

@69
<en>My impression of alchemy was much simpler and more manageable.
<es>

@71
<en>{Ran}\n"That's because the alchemy we study here is a special kind of it. This island has a very special power in itself and we use that power to make it easy and understandable to study alchemy."
<es>

@75
<en>{Ran}\n"It means we can skip all the necessary procedure and get right into refinement work more efficiently. Nonetheless, I still cannot get anything to work."
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A special power on this island..."
<es>

@77
<en>No wonder it was rather easy. I've never realized the foundation was already set in place to make things work easily.
<es>

@78
<en>To come to think of it, this island does have a special power. I feel that from time to time.
<es>

@79
<en>What a wondrous place this island is!
<es>

@80
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How are you gonna use my sperm?"
<es>

@81
<en>{Ran}\n"You just blend it with other materials and then refine it."
<es>

@83
<en>Ran pours my sperm into the flask that has been heated.
<es>

@85
<en>With a steamy sound, a white smoke starts to come out of the flask.
<es>

@88
<en>{Ran}\n"Whoa! Kazushi's sperm is in full swing!! Yeah!"
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Full swing, huh?"
<es>

@92
<en>{Ran}\n"Not sure...actually."
<es>

@93
<en>Ran stares at the flask, which shows no sign of change.
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's gonna happen next?"
<es>

@97
<en>{Ran}\n"No idea. Something should be happening. It's because your sperm and I have a perfect compatibility!! Great chemistry!!"
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Perfect compatibility? Great chemistry? You and my sperm?"
<es>

@99
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes."
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Chemistry between you and my sperm? I don't know about that..."
<es>

@103
<en>{Ran}\n"You don't...?"
<es>

@104
<en>Ran pouts like a sulky kid. Wait a minute!
<es>

@105
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does this have to do with what Fusen said to you?"
<es>

@114
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Is chemistry between you and Kazushi good enough?...I don't think you can even compare with Appo and me..."
<es>

@117
<en>{Ran}\n"She stares at Fusen."
<es>

@118
<en>Hmm? Is Ran upset?
<es>

@124
<en>Clearly, Ran was annoyed by Fusen's comment.
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are so cute..."
<es>

@128
<en>{Ran}\n"Cute? I was upset, you know."
<es>

@129
<en>Flushed slightly, Ran looks away. Her look, again, turns me on.
<es>

@132
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah! No way! We won't do it any more today!"
<es>

@133
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, come on! One more time...? Please?"
<es>

@134
<en>{Ran}\n"No!"
<es>

@137
<en>Bubbling-up sounds.
<es>

@138
<en>We heard strange sounds.
<es>

@141
<en>{Ran}\n"What?"
<es>

@146
<en>Inside the flask are bubbles growing big. Something is about to happen. Nothing like this ever happened to Ran's experiment.
<es>

@148
<en>What the fuck is going on?!
<es>

@151
<en>{Ran}\n"It's coming. It's coming! We got the perfect match - Kazushi's sperm and me."
<es>

@152
<en>Ran seems to be extremely happy. I like such an innocent look on her face.
<es>

@153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If this works out, this is gonna be your first successful case, huh?"
<es>

@156
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes! If I make it, I am gonna turn all the lead into gold. Eventually, this would make gold less valuable..."
<es>

@157
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hahaha. That's funny."
<es>

@158
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, I can't wait... What's happening now?"
<es>

@159
<en>She is so happy. She is not even talking about money. I have never seen Ran so happy.
<es>

@162
<en>A cracking sound.
<es>

@163
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@164
<en>I heard some cracking sound. I look around, but the heated flask seems to be okay.
<es>

@165
<en>Ran still stares at the flask.
<es>

@166
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did you hear something -- like cracking?"
<es>

@169
<en>{Ran}\n"No. I didn't hear anything."
<es>

@170
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure I heard something."
<es>

@173
<en>A cracking sound.
<es>

@174
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Again!"
<es>

@175
<en>I heard it again. It's so clear. But nothing seems to be happening to either the flask or windows.
<es>

@178
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, what is the matter? I didn't hear anything."
<es>

@179
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I did hear...Something is going on..."
<es>

@182
<en>Then I look at the heated flask. What the fuck!
<es>

@183
<en>Between the flask and the wall is a crack in space.
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What the fuck is that?"
<es>

@187
<en>{Ran}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@188
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Look! Right above the flask - - it's cracking."
<es>

@191
<en>{Ran}\n"What? I can't see it well."
<es>

@192
<en>Ran squints at it and shakes her head.
<es>

@193
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can't you see that? It is so clear now."
<es>

@196
<en>{Ran}\n"Aahh!!"
<es>

@197
<en>Suddenly, Ran screams out. It's not the flask, but the wall next to us that is cracking.
<es>

@198
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Woahhhh!?"
<es>

@201
<en>The grass breaks through the wall and grows up in full force like a snake.
<es>

@205
<en>{Ran}\n"Over there!"
<es>

@206
<en>The plants are growing fast from the floor and ceiling.
<es>

@207
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What the hell is going on?"
<es>

@208
<en>{Ran}\n"No clues...But it doesn't look very good, does it?"
<es>

@209
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Absolutely not!"
<es>

@210
<en>The crack in the space above the flask is becoming big. It looks like something is going to be born...
<es>

@211
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is definitely not good. Something crazy is gonna happen."
<es>

@212
<en>{Ran}\n"What are we going to do?"
<es>

@218
<en>{Ran}\n"Ran screams."
<es>

@219
<en>This time Ran heard the cracking sound. The flask begins to make a big crack on its surface. The liquid is spilling out of it.
<es>

@220
<en>Uh...It's gonna break!
<es>

@221
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran, this way!"
<es>

@223
<en>I press Ran against me and turn ourselves around against the flask.
<es>

@226
<en>We heard the glass burst into fragments.
<es>

@227
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh....It hurts...."
<es>

@228
<en>I got a sharp pain on my shoulder. It must have cut with broken glass. In no time, my shirt gets soaked with blood.
<es>

@231
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi!"
<es>

@232
<en>Ran looks up at me and notices the injury on my shoulder.
<es>

@235
<en>{Ran}\n"It's bleeding."
<es>

@236
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry about it. We got to do something about here first."
<es>

@237
<en>{Ran}\n"But..."
<es>

@238
<en>Drip, drip, drip..
<es>

@239
<en>The blood is dripping off my arm onto the floor.
<es>

@242
<en>{Ran}\n"No, it looks pretty bad, Kazushi. We got to stop bleeding."
<es>

@243
<en>Drip, drip, drip..
<es>

@244
<en>I keep bleeding. I thought it was only a scratch, but clearly it is not.
<es>

@245
<en>Drip, drip, drip..
<es>

@246
<en>Ah...
<es>

@249
<en>Suddenly, I lost my consciousness.
<es>

@251
<en>The next moment - I have become a puddle, no...it's more like a lake.
<es>

@252
<en>{Ran}\n"Ka-Kazushi? Where are you?"
<es>

@253
<en>Ran looks around. It seems Ran can't see me.
<es>

@254
<en>I want to say where I am, but I can't say anything.
<es>

@258
<en>{Ran}\n"What is this pond? Kazushi is gone and the pond appeared."
<es>

@259
<en>The pond suddenly bubbles up to the surface.
<es>

@261
<en>A big splash.
<es>

@264
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow!?"
<es>

@270
<en>Someone is appearing up from the lake. That is a beautiful woman who is shining brightly. It's Lake Fairy.
<es>

@272
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Who are you? You are not Japanese, are you?"
<es>

@273
<en>What is she up to? The Lake Fairy stretches her arms sideways and draws her flittering clothing out. Then, someone appears in her clothes..
<es>

@280
<en>There are two men - both are me! Me in gold and me in silver. What the hell is this?
<es>

@286
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Kazushi?"
<es>

@293
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"Did you drop the gold Kazushi or the silver Kazushi?"
<es>

@294
<en>The Lake Fairy asks Ran softly. Ran stares at it vacantly.
<es>

@300
<en>{Ran}\n"The gold Kazushi or the silver Kazushi?"
<es>

@301
<en>Ran looks at me from side to side. It seems she looks at the gold Kazushi more...
<es>

@304
<en>{Ran}\n"Is this something like a famous fairy tale that you can get back the one you really dropped in the lake?"
<es>

@305
<en>Ran is in a daze for a while, and finally gathers herself. Ran, please answer the question and get me out of here quick!
<es>

@312
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"The gold Kazushi or the silver Kazushi?"
<es>

@318
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahhh..."
<es>

@319
<en>{Ran}\n"Gold?"
<es>

@320
<en>What? An unexpected answer...
<es>

@323
<en>{Ran}\n"Wait! Silver? If I have to pick either a small basket or a big basket, I should pick a small one because I cannot be greedy, right?"
<es>

@324
<en>But, wait...Am I losing something more important?
<es>

@331
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"The silver Kazushi?"
<es>

@337
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahh....Sorry! It's gold! I dropped the gold Kazushi!!"
<es>

@338
<en>..................
<es>

@341
<en>{Ran}\n"If I can end up getting what I said, then I don't want to regret later. I bet on gold!"
<es>

@342
<en>Is she persuading herself? Is there anything more important than that?
<es>

@349
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"Are you sure it's the gold Kazushi?"
<es>

@355
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes, I'm sure! So give me the gold Kazushi!!"
<es>

@356
<en>..................What the fuck?
<es>

@360
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"Here is the gold Kazushi. Take it."
<es>

@361
<en>The Lake Fairy throws out the gold Kazushi, which lands on the floor with a thud.
<es>

@367
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow!? Is this gold? It looks so heavy! Yeah!! I'm lucky!!"
<es>

@368
<en>She is so delighted. But are you really lucky?
<es>

@369
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, look!! I wonder how much this is worth."
<es>

@370
<en>Is she blind?
<es>

@373
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmm? Kazushi?"
<es>

@374
<en>Ran now remembers I am not here. She looks around in the room to look for me.
<es>

@375
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi! I got the gold Kazushi! Where are you?"
<es>

@376
<en>{Ran}\n"Wait a minute..."
<es>

@377
<en>Ran is contemplating, putting her hand on her forehead.
<es>

@381
<en>{Ran}\n"..................Ah! I may have made a big mistake!!"
<es>

@382
<en>{Ran}\n"Maybe, I should have said "it's neither the gold Kazushi nor the silver Kazushi. What I dropped was the ordinary Kazushi!"."
<es>

@383
<en>Now you get it.
<es>

@386
<en>{Ran}\n"Fuuuuuuuck! What have I done?"
<es>

@387
<en>At the same time, she realized it was too late to notice. She looks pale.
<es>

@390
<en>{Ran}\n"Look! I'll return this gold Kazushi to you. Please give me the ordinary Kazushi back."
<es>

@394
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"There is no return policy."
<es>

@398
<en>{Ran}\n"Who the hell do you think you are? Give me Kazushi back!"
<es>

@402
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"I don't speak your language."
<es>

@406
<en>{Ran}\n"You have been speaking my language! Damn it! Give Kazushi back to me, please!!"
<es>

@410
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"Good bye."
<es>

@412
<en>Suddenly, the Lake Fairy disappeared.
<es>

@415
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, wait! I'm serious. Give me Kazushi back!"
<es>

@416
<en>{Ran}\n"Look. You didn't ask me if that was my final answer. So I should have another chance!!"
<es>

@419
<en>{Ran}\n"Nooo! You got to be kidding me. Give me Kazushi back! I mean it!"
<es>

@420
<en>Despite Run's desperate cry, there is no sign the Lake Fairy appears again. She doesn't even know whether her voice is heard.
<es>

@421
<en>{Ran}\n"Please! You can take everything I have! So please!"
<es>

@422
<en>Run keeps screaming out. Her cries echo over the sky.
<es>

@425
<en>A splashing sound.
<es>

@428
<en>Then the Lake Fairy reappears.
<es>

@432
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh! Please! Give me Kazushi back!"
<es>

@437
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"Then I will take something secondly important from you."
<es>

@441
<en>{Ran}\n"What....?"
<es>

@442
<en>The Lake Fairy swings her arms, fluttering her dress.
<es>

@444
<en>Something breaks away.
<es>

@447
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah!!"
<es>

@448
<en>The string of her purse hanging over her shoulder suddenly breaks. The purse is thrown into air and lands on the hand of the Lake Fairy.
<es>

@449
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah..Wait! That's my..."
<es>

@453
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"I now return the ordinary Kazushi."
<es>

@454
<en>The Lake Fairy won't listen to Ran. She just carries out their promise.
<es>

@455
<en>The Lake Fairy swings her arms hard again.
<es>

@456
<en>Ah...
<es>

@457
<en>I feel like my consciousness and body being pushed back.
<es>

@459
<en>A big splash.
<es>

@460
<en>I burst out into the surface of the lake and back to the lab room.
<es>

@465
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah! Kazushi!!"
<es>

@466
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!!"
<es>

@467
<en>{Ran}\n"Watch out!!"
<es>

@468
<en>I get thrown out all in wet. Ran catches me bodily, which shoves both us down on the floor.
<es>

@469
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It hurts...."
<es>

@470
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Are you alive?"
<es>

@471
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah...I'm fine..."
<es>

@474
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh...That's good..."
<es>

@475
<en>Holding me, Ran sighs with relief. But she picked the gold Kazushi first. I have mixed feelings....
<es>

@479
<en>{Lake Fairy}\n"As promised, I will take this..."
<es>

@483
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahh.Wait!"
<es>

@485
<en>Gurgling sound
<es>

@486
<en>With the purse in her hand, the Lake Fairy is sinking back to the bottom of the lake.
<es>

@489
<en>{Ran}\n"Aahh..my money...My....!!"
<es>

@490
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait...Calm down!!"
<es>

@492
<en>Ran desperately cries out for her money. I try to keep her away from the lake. The lake begins to bubble up to the surface.
<es>

@493
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, watch out, Ran!"
<es>

@494
<en>{Ran}\n"What's it now?"
<es>

@495
<en>Like boiling water, the lake begins to bubble up to the surface, and produces a large amount of steam.
<es>

@496
<en>{Ran}\n"What is this?!"
<es>

@497
<en>The steam completely blocks my sight.
<es>

@505
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah...?"
<es>

@506
<en>Within a split second, we find ourselves back in the same room.

@513

@514
<en>Her purse is at her feet. She picks it up.
<es>

@517
<en>{Ran}\n"Thank God...Was it an illusion?"
<es>

@518
<en>She looks inside her purse and pales visibly.
<es>

@519
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is the matter?"

<es>

@527

<es>

@528
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure? You had all of your money in the purse?"
<es>

@531
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes! All of it! I have been keeping it with me because I thought it's safe that way. Your one million was inside too!"
<es>

@532

<es>

@533

@537

<es>

@540
<en>{Ran}\n"Why don't we start over? Ah!!"
<es>

@543
<en>Ran backs off. The fire heating up the flask is blazing up.
<es>

@544
<en>The fire is burning too furiously to get close.
<es>

@545
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's burning too hard..."
<es>

@546
<en>The surge of flame sways like a living thing and grows bigger and bigger.
<es>

@549
<en>{Ran}\n"What the hell? We cannot start over!"
<es>

@551
<en>Ran flows into a rage. The flames are engulfing the whole room.
<es>

@552
<en>It is like we are inside the flask and the plants keep growing.
<es>

@553
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah...A flower..."
<es>

@554
<en>Flowers begin to come out from the plants. I have seen the flowers before - - the flowers that look like snow crystals.
<es>

@555
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The flowers in the school garden."
<es>

@556
<en>The same flowers that the principal was raising. We made a huge mess on the garden. And I know those flowers are the necessities of alchemy.
<es>

@557
<en>A billow of flames is scorching the grass and burning the flowers to black ashes.
<es>

@559
<en>Purplish smoke reeks up from burning flowers. The room is getting permeated with smoke.
<es>

@562
<en>{Ran}\n"Cough......This smoke...Give me my money back!"
<es>

@563
<en>Ran tries to make her way through the smoke. But the flames get in her way.
<es>

@566
<en>{Ran}\n"Get the hell out of my way!!"
<es>

@567
<en>She shouts out at the flames.
<es>

@568
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ran! Stop it! It's not safe!"
<es>

@569
<en>{Ran}\n"No! That's my money!!"
<es>

@570
<en>Ran tries to thrash her way through the flames.
<es>

@571
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey! Get back!! I will get it for you!"
<es>

@574
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Are you nuts? It's too dangerous!!"
<es>

@575
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about? You are the one that tried to go in there first!"
<es>

@578
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm fine. It's too dangerous for you, Kazushi!"

@579

@580

<es>

@581

<es>

@585

<es>

@587
<en>The flames are assaulting us, twirling like a tornado.
<es>

@588
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh!!"
<es>

@589
<en>Holding Ran, I jump sideways. With flames and smoke, we can't see anything now.
<es>

@590
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We got to get out of here."
<es>

@593
<en>{Ran}\n"Nooo... Not...Without my money..."
<es>

@594
<en>After sobbing uncontrollably, Ran realized that it is not safe to stay here.
<es>

@595
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's get out of here."
<es>

@596
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes..."
<es>

@599
<en>With teary eyes, Ran nods in consent. I set out to run, holding her tight.
<es>

@600
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shit! The door..."
<es>

@601
<en>The door is blocked by the ivy..
<es>

@604
<en>I hit and kick the door, but it won't move even a bit.
<es>

@608
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, right there!"
<es>

@609
<en>Ran points out to the window.
<es>

@610
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's right!"
<es>

@611
<en>This is the second floor. We can jump down from here. It's better than getting stuck in the fire and smoke.
<es>

@614
<en>The flames are twirling like a tornado. We thrash through the fire to the window and we open it.
<es>

@615
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We will jump, Ran!!"
<es>

@618
<en>{Ran}\n"Aahh...My money...."
<es>

@619

<es>

@625
<en>Suddenly the flames burst out intensely.
<es>

@626
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!"
<es>

@628
<en>With Ran in my arms, I jump out of window.
<es>

@630
<en>Wham.
<es>

@631
<en>That moment, we heard a big explosion behind us.
<es>

@632

<es>

@633

@635
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh...!!"
<es>

@636
<en>{Ran}\n"Aahhhh!! Wowaaaa!!"
<es>

@646
<en>After rolling over on the ground, we finally stopped.
<es>

@647
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh....Damn...Ran, are you okay?"
<es>

@651
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes...but..."
<es>

@652
<en>She stares at the room vacantly. The black smoke and flames are both moving around the building, like a snake licking around.
<es>

@653
<en>{Ran}\n"It's burning....My money..."
<es>

@654
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, give up on the money. We are now in a big trouble."
<es>

@655
<en>This is definitely not good. What is gonna happen to us now?
<es>

@656
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They may kick us out of school?"
<es>

@659
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't care. Huh..."
<es>

@660
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't give up!"
<es>

@664
<en>{A sign board}\n"Fire! Fire! Evacuate!!"
<es>

@665
<en>The people must have heard the blast. They start to huddle up. It seems that the problem has just started.
