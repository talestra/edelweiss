@7
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK! He's open today."
<es>

@8
<en>I'm glad I woke up early and got all the change I could find.
<es>

@9
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hello."
<es>

@10
<en>I called out as I enter the store. Miya came out from the back.
<es>

@13
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Hey, Kazushi. How are you?"
<es>

@14
<en>He's always in the back room. Maybe he doesn't want to work hard.
<es>

@15
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm looking for a chopsticks and some bowl. Do you also have any cup, too?"
<es>

@16
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Yeah, sure. So, you decided to get your own dinnerware? I thought the guys like you didn't care."
<es>

@17
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not mine..."
<es>

@18
<en>But, I stopped to talk. It's kind of embarrassing to admit that I'm actually buying these for a girl.
<es>

@21
<en>Miya smiled kindly.
<es>

@22
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I see. You are getting them for a girl?"
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!? You read my mind!! Do you have ESP ability??"
<es>

@24
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I can tell by looking at your face. I have a lot girl stuff in stock. Most of the customers are girls here, you know?"
<es>

@25
<en>Miya invited me inside. There, I saw a section filled with daily use stuff, like chopsticks, cups and dishes.
<es>

@26
<en>It was mostly girl stuff as Miya said.
<es>

@29
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"What kind of a girl is she? What kind of design would she like?"
<es>

@30
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well..."
<es>

@31
<en>I thought about Natsume. What would she like?
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe this fancy stuff? She is petite and cute."
<es>

@33
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, she is little bit strange. Maybe she has a different taste."
<es>

@36
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"She must be younger than you, huh?"
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, you know. Oh, that new girl. You know? Natsume Amamiya."
<es>

@42
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Oh, yeah..."
<es>

@43
<en>As soon as I mentioned her name, Miya changed his facial expression.
<es>

@44
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is everything OK?"
<es>

@47
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Yeah, well, I haven't met her yet, so I don't know who she is."
<es>

@48
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@49
<en>It sounded like he was just making an excuse. Something is not right.
<es>

@50
<en>I remembered what I heard yesterday. The girl who came to look for her father looks just like Natsume.
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did you know Natsume, Miya?"
<es>

@52
<en>I just felt that. He seemed he knew her but hiding it for some reason.
<es>

@55
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"No, I haven't met her yet. Did you say she just came here?"
<es>

@56
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's what I thought. But I'm not sure. The man at the grocery store says he saw someone just like her few years ago."
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you know anything about that?"
<es>

@58
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"No. I don't get around that much. I've never heard of that."
<es>

@59
<en>I think that he knows something. I just feel that.
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, OK... That's too bad."
<es>

@61
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Unfortunately..."
<es>

@62
<en>He seems like he knows, but he doesn't want to talk about it.
<es>

@63
<en>Then I just thought maybe he closed the store yesterday on purpose, because I was with Natsume.
<es>

@64
<en>Am I thinking too far? But I just can't let go of the doubt.
<es>

@67
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I don't know about her, but I should give you a piece of advise."
<es>

@68
<en>{Kazushi}\n"An advise?"
<es>

@69
<en>Miya's voice changed. It doesn't sound like the usual nice guy at the store.
<es>

@70
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Maybe you shouldn't get too close to that girl, Natsume Amamiya."
<es>

@71
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@72
<en>What kind of an advise is that? He said he doesn't know her, but why would he say such a thing?
<es>

@73
<en>It sounds like he knows her very well from the statement he just made. Why would he say I shouldn't get involved if he didn't know her.
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya, you do know about her, don't you?"
<es>

@77
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"You never know."
<es>

@78
<en>He didn't make yes or no, and just shook his head. But the way he didn't answer seems to me like an answer.
<es>

@79
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"....."
<es>

@80
<en>Miya didn't say anything and looked at the dinnerware at the store. And he reached over to one of the bowl.
<es>

@83
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Maybe you should give this to her."
<es>

@84
<en>It was a bowl with a cute cat design on it.
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why did you pick this out?"
<es>

@88
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"....."
<es>

@89
<en>But, he didn't say anything at all. I wonder why he looks lonely as he kept silence.
<es>

@90
<en>I couldn't ask him anymore than that.
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It sure is weird."
<es>

@96
<en>I did get the gift to Natsume, but I didn't feel well. I just couldn't understand.
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm so sure Miya knows something about Natsume. Why does he act like he doesn't know her?"
<es>

@98
<en>But, why does he know her? Who is Natsume?
<es>

@99
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know anything about Natsume."
<es>

@100
<en>Where she came from and why she appeared like that.
<es>

@101
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can find out about it later. Well, I should give this to her."
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Have you seen Natsume?"
<es>

@107
<en>I brought the gift to the cafeteria, but I can't find Natsume.
<es>

@112
<en>{Pierre}\n"Mm... I haven't seen her."
<es>

@115
<en>{Daigo}\n"Is she taking a nap? Maybe still sleeping."
<es>

@119
<en>{Rin}\n"That's so cute. Do you think she has her belly out?"
<es>

@123
<en>{Sakura}\n"Shouldn't we wake her up? I'll go find her. And maybe attack her."
<es>

@125
<en>Bang!
<es>

@128
<en>{Sakura}\n"Ouch!"
<es>

@129
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No attacking. Can't be real."
<es>

@133
<en>{Daigo}\n"Maybe you should wait for a while."
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess..."
<es>

@137
<en>.....
<es>

@138
<en>....
<es>

@139
<en>But, Natsume didn't show up.
<es>

@144
<en>I went over to the girl's dorm to find out.
<es>

@145
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is she sleeping?"
<es>

@146
<en>There was no lights in her room. Is she not feeling well? It was a hot day today, so maybe she's dehydrated?
<es>

@149
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hey, Kazushi?"
<es>

@150
<en>Haruka came over. She had an ice cream in her mouth and her hair was wet. Seems she just came back from the shower.
<es>

@151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey. Just came out of a shower?"
<es>

@152
<en>Haruka smiled with a clean boiled egg like smooth skin.
<es>

@155
<en>{Haruka}\n"The ice cream after the shower is the best. I love summer."
<es>

@156
<en>She likes summer because of the ice cream... That is so Haruka like, but I didn't feel like chatting.
<es>

@157
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Look, have you seen Natsume?"
<es>

@160
<en>{Haruka}\n"Natsume? No. I haven't seen her. What happened?"
<es>

@161
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She didn't come to the dinner. And the lights are off in her room."
<es>

@164
<en>{Haruka}\n"What? She skipped dinner? That's not right."
<es>

@165
<en>She looked up to Natsume's room worried. The curtains were open, but the room was too dark to see inside of it.
<es>

@168
<en>{Haruka}\n"Well, I'll go to her room, and see what's going on. Hold this."
<es>

@172
<en>She made me hold her ice cream and ran.
<es>

@173
<en>In a little while, the lights were turned on in Natsume's room. The windows were opened and Haruka looked out of it.
<es>

@174
<en>{Haruka}\n"Natsume is not here."
<es>

@175
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No? Is she in the restroom?"
<es>

@176
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't know. Let me check."
<es>

@177
<en>Haruka disappeared.
<es>

@179
<en>Haruka came out from the main entrance in a while.
<es>

@183
<en>{Haruka}\n"She's not there either. I don't think she is in the dorm."
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder where she went skipping dinner..."
<es>

@185
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't know. When do you think she disappeared?"
<es>

@186
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I haven't seen her since this morning. I was off campus and all."
<es>

@187
<en>{Haruka}\n"Let's look around, then."
<es>

@188
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK..."
<es>

@195
<en>The sound of glass breaking
<es>

@196
<en>We heard a braking noise all the sudden and stopped.
<es>

@197
<en>{Haruka}\n"What was that?"
<es>

@198
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It sounded like a glass window breaking. Where is it?"
<es>

@201
<en>{Haruka}\n"I think, over there!"
<es>

@202
<en>We turned around. It was coming from the school building.
<es>

@203
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's go."
<es>

@204
<en>I felt uneasy.
<es>

@209
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where is it?"
<es>

@211
<en>The sound of glass breaking
<es>

@212
<en>That noise again. This time is more closer.
<es>

@215
<en>{Haruka}\n"Over there!"
<es>

@216
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is it in the lab?"
<es>

@221
<en>The lab was so quiet.
<es>

@222
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did it really come from here?"
<es>

@223
<en>It was really quiet. Maybe it was too quiet, if I could say.
<es>

@226
<en>{Haruka}\n"What is this... The air is tight."
<es>

@227
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The air?"
<es>

@228
<en>I stroked the air around me. It didn't seem to be any different than usual to me.
<es>

@231
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm sure there is someone in here."
<es>

@232
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is it Natsume?"
<es>

@235
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't know. But, maybe not alone."
<es>

@236
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How many people?"
<es>

@237
<en>There are few people inside. And they are doing something to break the window? Is Natsume in trouble?
<es>

@240
<en>{Haruka}\n"Do you want to go in?"
<es>

@241
<en>She is making statement to tell me it could get dangerous.
<es>

@242
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shouldn't you wait here, Haruka?"
<es>

@243
<en>I don't want her to be involved in anything dangerous. But Haruka laugh it out.
<es>

@246
<en>{Haruka}\n"You don't have to worry about me, Kazushi. OK, Let's go."
<es>

@250
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's so dark..."
<es>

@251
<en>The lab was very dark like a night. The curtain was open, but it seems like the light from outside was shut out for some reason.
<es>

@252
<en>It was too dark to see.
<es>

@255
<en>{Haruka}\n"Somebody is there..."
<es>

@257
<en>Haruka sounded nervous. I try to see as hard as I could. Then, I saw a figure of a person in the dark.
<es>

@258
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume?"
<es>

@261
<en>{Principal}\n"Is it Haruka and Kazushi?"
<es>

@262
<en>It was not a voice of Natsume. But it was the principal.
<es>

@266
<en>{Haruka}\n"I thought it was you, grandma."
<es>

@267
<en>Haruka sounded like she knew. We felt little bit better as we walked inside. Then our eyes got used to the darkness. Now we could see much better.
<es>

@270
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh!"
<es>

@271
<en>Haruka found it little bit faster than I did. I was looking at it as she made a sound.
<es>

@273
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@274
<en>I couldn't believe what I was looking at. Natsume was on the floor. And we knew why she was on the floor, right away.
<es>

@275
<en>There was a thing looks like a knife stabbed into her chest. It seems like it's not too deep, but the blade is reflecting the light of the moon.
<es>

@276
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume!"
<es>

@277
<en>{Haruka}\n"What happened?"
<es>

@278
<en>It was like we are in a dream. Noting seems real to me. Maybe it's more real to be in the dream.
<es>

@279
<en>Because you don't think you are dreaming, when you are dreaming.
<es>

@280
<en>{Haruka}\n"What happened? Grandma!!"
<es>

@281
<en>Haruka yelled out. Maybe Natsume could hear it, she moved a little.
<es>

@282
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume!!"
<es>

@283
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@284
<en>We stood there like the time has stopped, but we started to move as soon as Natsume made some noise.
<es>

@285
<en>We ran to Natsume and she looked at me with her big eyes.
<es>

@286
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@287
<en>It looks painful, but it doesn't seem real. Maybe because Natsume is not acting like it hurts her.
<es>

@288
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hold on. I'll get that knife out of you..."
<es>

@289
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't care about that."
<es>

@290
<en>She said so, and she grabbed my arm. It was really powerful, it surprised me.
<es>

@291
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi."
<es>

@292
<en>She looked up to me. I couldn't move as I felt like I was sucked into her huge eyes.
<es>

@293
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We need to do something about this..."
<es>

@294
<en>{Natsume}\n"No. Stay here."
<es>

@295
<en>She grabbed my arm harder.
<es>

@296
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's worthless. I don't have anything now."
<es>

@297
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? What?"
<es>

@298
<en>Natsume moved her eyes. She was looking at the principal. The principal is just standing there without saying anything.
<es>

@299
<en>{Haruka}\n"What? What are you talking about?"
<es>

@300
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The principal. What is going on here!?"
<es>

@301
<en>{Principal}\n"Don't worry. She is not hurt, nor she's going to die. She is not a human being."
<es>

@302
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@303
<en>Natsume is not a human being? What do you mean?
<es>

@304
<en>{Haruka}\n"What do you mean by that?"
<es>

@305
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@306
<en>The hand grabbed me little stronger, and I looked at her.
<es>

@307
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@308
<en>It surprise me as I looked back at her. It seemed like Natsume is now transparent.
<es>

@309
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's going on? Natsume??"
<es>

@310
<en>I grabbed her hand. I felt her hands in the beginning , but then the feeling of her hands got more blur by the minute.
<es>

@311
<en>{Natsume}\n"Thank for telling me that you like me."
<es>

@312
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? I can say that more, you know?"
<es>

@313
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah. It's enough."
<es>

@314
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Idiot! I'll tell you more! Natsume, I like you! I like you!"
<es>

@315
<en>{Natsume}\n"Idiot..."
<es>

@316
<en>Maybe it was just me that she seems embarrassed, because her figure is getting more transparent and it was hard to see her.
<es>

@317
<en>Her red lips and the shine of her eyes are the last to go.
<es>

@318
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, where are you going! Natsume!?"
<es>

@319
<en>She made a last smile with her lips and eyes.
<es>

@320
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi. Bye"
<es>

@322
<en>It was her last word and her body melted into the dark and disappeared.
<es>

@323
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume? Natsume!!"
<es>

@324
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh...."
<es>

@325
<en>My arms are in the shape to hold Natsume, but now I'm holding onto emptiness.
<es>

@326
<en>{Haruka}\n"Natsume disappeared..."
<es>

@327
<en>The warms of the body is replaced by the cold of the night.
<es>

@328
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume!"
<es>

@329
<en>I called out, but nothing came back. The proof that she existed disappeared just like that.
<es>

@330
<en>{Haruka}\n"What is this? What's going on, grandma?"
<es>

@331
<en>I've never heard her upset like this. And now she is yelling at the principal. The principal was looking at the emptiness in my arm.
<es>

@332
<en>{Principal}\n"She was not a human being."
<es>

@333
<en>Her unrealistic comment brought me back to the reality. I couldn't believe what she was saying.
<es>

@334
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean by that?"
<es>

@335
<en>{Haruka}\n"Do you mean...."
<es>

@336
<en>Haruka thought of something and looked at the space Natsume was laying down just a moment ago.
<es>

@337
<en>{Haruka}\n"Could it be a homunculus?"
<es>

@338
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A homunculus?"
<es>

@339
<en>I've never heard of that word. Wait, have I heard it somewhere?
<es>

@340
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's a living body made artificially. The alchemists were trying to make a perfect living body by alchemy."
<es>

@341
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Artificially? Can you do that?"
<es>

@342
<en>{Haruka}\n"They might be able to... I'm not sure."
<es>

@343
<en>Haruka looked at the principal.
<es>

@344
<en>{Principal}\n"All I can say is that they could make it to certain extent."
<es>

@345
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what about Natsume?"
<es>

@346
<en>Was she the end result of the certain extent that the principal is saying? She was no different than any of us.
<es>

@347
<en>{Principal}\n"But she is not a homunculus."
<es>

@348
<en>But the principal denied Haruka's theory as well.
<es>

@349
<en>{Haruka}\n"She is not a homunculus? So, she is not a human being, and was not made artificially? How could it happen?"
<es>

@350
<en>Can anything like that exist? No way. If it does, then it's just like...
<es>

@351
<en>{Principal}\n"Just like a dream. She was a phantom."
<es>

@352
<en>The principal mumbled as she read my mind.
<es>

@353
<en>{Haruka}\n"Natsume was a phantom?"
<es>

@354
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No way!!"
<es>

@355
<en>{Principal}\n"Well, it's not so absurd. Because there is no proof of her existence. We don't have a record at school that she existed."
<es>

@356
<en>{Principal}\n"Have you ever seen a person disappeared in front of many people?"
<es>

@357

@543
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe she really didn't exist?"
<es>

@544
<en>It is a cruel thing, but as the time passes, Natsume seemed like a dream at times.
<es>

@545
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume Amamiya...."
<es>

@546
<en>Was it really a phantom? What is a phantom? The principal said it was like a dream.
<es>

@547
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A dream... I wish to see her even in a dream."

@548

@564
<en>What was that? When did that happened?
<es>

@565
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is it a dream?"
<es>

@566
<en>Sometimes you remember a dream you saw few days ago. This was kind of like that.
<es>

@567
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I saw her dream...when?"
<es>

@568
<en>It's not unusual to see a dream of someone you like. Maybe I saw a dream of Natsume and just remembered that now.
<es>

@569
<en>But...
<es>

@572
<en>{Appo-}\n"Why are you looking at the ceiling?"

<es>

@589
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What about the dream?"
<es>

@590
<en>I guess I didn't dream.
<es>

@591
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's not right. Why?"
<es>

@592
<en>I thought I can see her if I dream. I can't see her anymore for real?
<es>

@593
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait. Hold on."
<es>

@594
<en>Maybe seeing her in a dream does not work.
<es>

@595
<en>I'm not sure why she was in the dream. But that is not the place.
<es>

@596
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I have to bring her here somehow."

@597
<en>Natsume, where are you?
<es>

@598

<es>

@599
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume..."
<es>

@600
<en>I called out her name. And the taste of iron comes back on my lips. I do feel it.
<es>

@601
<en>The tiny link between Natsume and I. It is just like a spider web,but I feel the link to Natsume.
<es>

@602
<en>Natsume exist in this world for sure.
<es>

@603
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I have to wake her up if she is still sleeping."
<es>

@604
<en>I have to wake her up anyhow.
<es>

@609
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe we haven't met Natsume yet."
<es>

@612
<en>{Pierre}\n"He's making a nonsense after all these time."
<es>

@613
<en>Everybody is looking at me weird. I understand that. I'm sure I'm making absurd statement.
<es>

@617
<en>{Haruka}\n"What are you talking about."
<es>

@618
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My first meeting with Natsume was in my dream."
<es>

@622
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Are you OK, Kazushi? Have you gone crazy?"
<es>

@623
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I'm perfectly fine. Don't worry."
<es>

@627
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So, you are serious. What do you mean you met Natsume in your dream?"
<es>

@632
<en>{Sakura}\n"Then, who is that Natsume we met? Was she also a dream?"
<es>

@636
<en>{Rin}\n"But I wasn't sleeping."
<es>

@637
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, that's not a dream. That was a..."
<es>

@640
<en>Because I'm a shadow...
<es>

@641
<en>She said that. Maybe it was her shadow we were looking at, just like she said.
<es>

@642
<en>I'm not fully understanding it, so it's hard to explain. But I try to say whatever I was feeling at the time.
<es>

@645
<en>{Haruka}\n"A shadow. Is it kind of like an alter ego?"
<es>

@646
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe."
<es>

@647
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But I'm sure there is a real Natsume somewhere. Not the one we saw, or the one I saw in my dream."
<es>

@648
<en>It was only an instinct. But I was so sure, because I could feel it in my skin.
<es>

@651
<en>{Haruka}\n"You said you bled when your lips hit her lips. It could be just an accident that you met Natsume, but maybe you made special link when that happened."
<es>

@652
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A special link..."
<es>

@655
<en>{Haruka}\n"The blood has been a symbol of the contract. It may happened as an accident, but Natsume and you made a contract because of that."
<es>

@656
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that why I feel the link to Natsume?"
<es>

@659
<en>{Haruka}\n"Maybe so. Can you follow your feelings? Maybe we can find out where Natsume is by following that."
<es>

@660
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean follow the feelings?"
<es>

@661
<en>I do feel the link to Natsume. And I'm sure Natsume is on the other end of the link.
<es>

@662
<en>But it is such a tiny, fine, spider web kind of feeling. When I try to follow that lead, I loose it, because it is too fine.
<es>

@665
<en>{Haruka}\n"That is not possible..."
<es>

@670
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Do you have any other lead?"
<es>

@671
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Other lead.... Oh, yeah!"
<es>

@672
<en>I remembered. The only lead we have in order to know about her.
<es>

@673
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume was looking for her father."
<es>

@674
<en>I totally forgot. I was hoping to find him for her. But I remembered it now.
<es>

@677
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Father?"
<es>

@681
<en>{Daigo}\n"Her father is on this island?"
<es>

@685
<en>{Pierre}\n"You mean, she is a local?"
<es>

@689
<en>{Haruka}\n"No, that is not right. Because I don't know her."
<es>

@692
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The man at the grocery store said he's seen someone just like Natsume. And that girl was looking for her father."
<es>

@693
<en>Natsume wasn't living at this island. But, her father was on this island. And she came to visit him.
<es>

@694
<en>That make sense.
<es>

@697
<en>{Ran}\n"I'll find out more about that story. Don't worry, I won't charge you too much."
<es>

@702
<en>{Pierre}\n"But she's going to charge him?"
<es>

@703
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll pay what ever you ask. So, please, Ran."
<es>

@707
<en>{Ran}\n"Sure, don't worry. You guys help me."
<es>

@708
<en>Ran called out for Appo- and other three guys.
<es>

@716
<en>{Appo-}\n"Why do I have to?"
<es>

@717
<en>{Pierre}\n"Well, come on. It might be fun."
<es>

@718

<es>

@719
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK!"
<es>

@725
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'll help too. If she is still on this island, then I think she has to do something with alchemy."
<es>

@726
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think so too."
<es>

@728
<en>I met Natsume in my dream. And she disappeared in front of Haruka and I. There are too many mysteries.
<es>

@729
<en>Maybe it has something to do with alchemy.
<es>

@732
<en>{Haruka}\n"If that is the case, then our school has something to do with this..."
<es>

@733
<en>Haruka didn't say anything, but she must be thinking of the principal. And so was I.
<es>

@734
<en>The principal was there when Natsume disappeared, and she acted weird.
<es>

@735
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm pretty sure she in on this campus. I think my grandma is hiding something."
<es>

@736
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe..."
<es>

@738
<en>I'm sure the principal knows something. And....
<es>

@739
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Ran?"
<es>

@742
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh? What?"
<es>

@743
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I want you to investigate a certain person. I think it will make your job much easier."
<es>

@744
<en>{Ran}\n"About the father? Who?"
<es>

@745
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. That is..."
<es>

@750
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hello."
<es>

@753
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Oh, Kazushi."
<es>

@754
<en>Miya was in the store, and it was unusual for him. It was like he knew I was coming and waiting for me.
<es>

@755
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you know why I'm here?"
<es>

@756
<en>It was a sixth sense. Miya smiled.
<es>

@759
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I heard that the girls at the school was investigating about me. Something like that will go around much faster than you think."
<es>

@760
<en>The girls must be Ran and the other guys. Maybe they were doing it on purpose so that Miya notices it.
<es>

@761
<en>Which helps me to talk to him directly.
<es>

@762
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You must know where Natsume is, Miya."
<es>

@763
<en>I asked him directly.
<es>

@766
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"....."
<es>

@767
<en>He didn't answer. But that silence made me believe he knows something about it.
<es>

@768
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure you know, don't you? Please tell me."
<es>

@769
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"That girl.... Isn't she the one who disappeared? Why would I know about her?"
<es>

@770
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Because the father must know about his own daughter!"
<es>

@773
<en>There were no tricks to play. But the straight questions were more effective than I thought.
<es>

@776
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"...."
<es>

@777
<en>Maybe he was expecting about all this.
<es>

@778
<en>He looked down as he gave up, and understand what is going on.
<es>

@779
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, that is true. Ran said it was so hard to find your real name. You haven't told anyone on this island about your real name."
<es>

@780
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I'm one of the alchemist. We don't want anybody to know about our real name. It doesn't do any good."
<es>

@781
<en>He wants to say it is OK to hide his real name because of that? He didn't mean anything else? But all of that doesn't matter now.
<es>

@782
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya, your "Miya"comes from "Amamiya". Mr.Renji Amamiya. And your nick name is "Miya"."
<es>

@783
<en>It was his real name. Amamiya... It is the same last name as Natsume.
<es>

@784
<en>Amamiya may not be such a unique last name. But in the remote island like this? It can't be too popular.
<es>

@787
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Yes. Everybody called me by that name since long time ago."
<es>

@788
<en>Miya didn't try to hide anything. Maybe he never tried to, but just not saying anything.
<es>

@789
<en>If that is so, then it is ironical. If everybody knew about his real name, then it would have been so easy for Natsume to find Miya.
<es>

@790
<en>Pierre and other guys found out about Natsume's where about. Natsume was asking around in town about Miya.
<es>

@791
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya.... Mr.Amamiya. Natsume is looking for you."
<es>

@794
<en>{Amamiya}\n"....."
<es>

@795
<en>Miya had a bitter expression on his face. It seems like Miya knew Natsume was looking for him.
<es>

@796
<en>Then, why are they not together?
<es>

@797
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did you see Natsume? You knew she was looking for you, but didn't tell her you are her father? Why did you do that?"
<es>

@798
<en>Miya laughed for some reason. It was a cynical laugh, that made me feel bad.
<es>

@801
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I'm not anything like a father. I have never done anything father-like for her."
<es>

@802
<en>A bitter words came out of his mouth.
<es>

@803
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I knew Natsume came to look for me. It is a small island, if someone new comes in, you instantly know."
<es>

@804
<en>Not only the man at the grocery store, but many other people in town remembered about her. Of course Miya would not miss that.
<es>

@807
<en>{Amamiya}\n"But, I didn't see her. No, I couldn't."
<es>

@808
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why?"
<es>

@809
<en>Why a father can't see his own daughter?
<es>

@812
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I wan in a middle of the huge experiment. The experiment in alchemy takes a lot of time."
<es>

@813
<en>{Amamiya}\n"This experiment was so huge, it took few years even with the power of this island."
<es>

@814
<en>{Amamiya}\n"And we were about to complete the experiment at the time. I couldn't just let it go."
<es>

@815
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, I'm sure you could see her for a few minute. It sounds like you are making excuses."
<es>

@816
<en>{Amamiya}\n"My determination will be shaken if I see her. The disturbance of the alchemist will affect the outcome of the experiment."
<es>

@817
<en>Miya said so, and shook his head.
<es>

@820
<en>{Amamiya}\n"No. Maybe I was just making an excuse just like you said."
<es>

@821
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I didn't want to see her. Maybe I was scared to see her."
<es>

@822
<en>Miya hid in his lab, and try not to let her know where he was.
<es>

@823
<en>{Amamiya}\n"But, somehow she find out."
<es>

@824
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume did?"
<es>

@827
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Yes. She has a special sense like that. Maybe she has a great potential as a alchemist."
<es>

@828
<en>Miya looked happy when he said that. Perhaps it was a face of a father.
<es>

@829
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, Natsume did see you then."
<es>

@830
<en>I'm sure that's what happens after she came to his lab.
<es>

@833
<en>{Amamiya}\n"She came. Well, so I heard."
<es>

@834
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So you heard?"
<es>

@837
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It was a bad timing, but I wasn't in the lab at the time. Hisae was in the lab."
<es>

@838
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? The principal was?"
<es>

@839
<en>{Amamiya}\n"She is also an alchemist, and she is a joint researcher as well. She came to see how the experiment was coming along at the time."
<es>

@840
<en>So, Natsume and the principal knew each other. Come to think of it, they did act like they knew each other already.
<es>

@841
<en>But, it didn't seem like they had a good relationship.
<es>

@842
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what happened then?"
<es>

@843
<en>Did something happened to make their relationship sore? But Miya shook his head.
<es>

@846
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I don't know. When I went back, the experiment had finished already."
<es>

@847
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Really?"
<es>

@848
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The experiment was coming along well, but it had been interrupted right before the successful completion. It was a failure and I found Natsume on the ground."
<es>

@849
<en>The failed experiment. Natsume on the floor...
<es>

@850
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean?"
<es>

@853
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What we were trying to make in the experiment was a rock of mystery which existed on this island long time ago."
<es>

@854
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A rock of mystery?"
<es>

@855
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It was under the ground on this island, but it disappeared after some incident. All the details of the incident is only known to Hisae."
<es>

@856
<en>{Amamiya}\n"She looked all over the place, but couldn't find it. Well, she is still looking for it. And at the same time, she's trying to make the same rock on her own."
<es>

@857
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is this rock?"
<es>

@859
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I think it is a philosopher's stone or something like that. It is the highest material the alchemy can make. It gives an eternal life to human being. Such a mystical existence."
<es>

@861
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The eternal life?"
<es>

@862
<en>Something like eternal youth? But, it is ridiculous.
<es>

@864
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It is a never ending dream which the human beings has been chasing since the beginning of the history. The dream is to make a material called a philosopher's stone in alchemy, and kin-tan in Chinese Buddhism."
<es>

@866
<en>{Amamiya}\n"That was the purpose of our experiment."
<es>

@867
<en>I just thought he was an alchemist in the middle of his explanation. He doesn't seem so sharp usually, but this story is way over my head.
<es>

@868
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you really believe in eternal youth?"
<es>

@869
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It's not about if it exist or not. You have to start from "it does exist". Otherwise, you can't understand what we as an alchemists are doing."
<es>

@870
<en>I can't understand that. I don't believe in eternal life, and I don't even want that.
<es>

@871
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The reason why I was called out to this island was to make this mysterious material by our self."
<es>

@873
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I was invited by Hisae to this island as her co-researcher. I was caught by attractive island."
<es>

@875
<en>{Amamiya}\n"This island has a magical power, and it was very interesting. I was sure that I'll be able to accomplish what I have never done here in this island."
<es>

@877
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I planned to stay for 6 month, and then it was one year, and then two years. I lost the count of time, and concentrated on my experiment. Of course, my wife gave up on me."
<es>

@879
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I can understand that. I never thought about my family. And the time has passed by so quickly."
<es>

@884
<en>Natsume came to the island after so many years on this island, and his memory about the past was so far away.
<es>

@885
<en>{Amamiya}\n"When I found out that Natsume...my daughter came to the island, I was so surprised. And then I heard that she was looking for me."
<es>

@886
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But you avoided her. Why didn't you see her?"
<es>

@887
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I thought about it. But I was a chicken. I was scared."
<es>

@890
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I told myself I'll go see her after this experiment, or after this experiment goes well, and I stayed in the lab."
<es>

@891
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How can a father be scared to see his own daughter?"
<es>

@892
<en>That is such a sad story. Miya is smiling cynically.
<es>

@893
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You are right. I hate myself for that."
<es>

@894
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why did the experiment failed? It was about to finish, right?"
<es>

@895
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The mixing was going almost perfect and it was about to be completed. But it was taken away before it finished."
<es>

@896
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who took it away?"
<es>

@900
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume did and the rock is inside of Natsume now."
<es>

@901
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@902
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume ate the incomplete philosopher's rock."
<es>

@903
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She ate it? Is it OK to eat it?"
<es>

@904
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The rock she ate was not a regular rock. The philosopher's rock is a somewhat liquid material."
<es>

@905
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A liquid rock?"
<es>

@906
<en>I can't imagine. But, if it was a liquid, maybe it's easier to eat it than regular rock.
<es>

@907
<en>Can her body take that?
<es>

@908
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why did Natsume do such a thing?"
<es>

@911
<en>{Amamiya}\n"She hated alchemy. I think she wanted to take alchemy away from me. Because I never had time for her."
<es>

@912
<en>Miya said he never thought about his family. Natsume thought the alchemy took her father away from her.
<es>

@915
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The rock she ate was then absorbed from inside-out and it became her blood and bones."
<es>

@916
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Therefore, she maybe the closest human being to the mystery of the alchemy."
<es>

@917
<en>I can't believe she had such a important accomplishment. She didn't look like that.
<es>

@918
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, where is Natsume now? What happened to Natsume after that?"
<es>

@921
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume has been sleeping."
<es>

@922
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sleeping?"
<es>

@923
<en>I knew it. That's why we met in my dream. Is she still dreaming now?
<es>

@924
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, how did it happen? Isn't she waking up?"
<es>

@925
<en>{Amamiya}\n"She is put to sleep."
<es>

@926
<en>{Kazushi}\n"By whom? Why is she put to sleep?"
<es>

@927
<en>Maybe it was something Miya didn't want to talk about. He looked sad.
<es>

@930
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Maybe because of the rock. Natsume attacked Hisae right after she ate the rock."
<es>

@931
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@932
<en>Natsume attacked the principal?
<es>

@933
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae said she felt scared for her life. Natsume's power was overwhelming."
<es>

@934
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That Natsume? No way!"
<es>

@935
<en>Could it be an influence of the rock?
<es>

@936
<en>{Amamiya}\n"It could be a shock reaction for taking some foreign object into her body. Sometimes the antibody reaction happens."
<es>

@940
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I think the rock became familiar with her body by now. I don't think she will be dangerous like that anymore. But, I'm not sure if we should test that again."
<es>

@942
<en>The result is she is still too dangerous.
<es>

@943
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, what are you going to do about Natsume? Are you going to put her to sleep forever?"
<es>

@946
<en>{Amamiya}\n"This was Hisae's decision. She has her own plan."
<es>

@947
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What happens to Natsume now?"
<es>

@948
<en>I notice myself yelling. I can't accept that even if it is the decision by the principal.
<es>

@952
<en>{Amamiya}\n"That is why I have tried to make a use of alchemy to the field of medicine. I'm trying to think of a way to get the rock out of Natsume. But I haven't been successful."
<es>

@954
<en>He said that the rock melted inside of Natsume and became her blood and bones. Can you get that out of her?
<es>

@955
<en>That sounds so vague.
<es>

@956
<en>{Kazushi}\n"When would you be able to save Natsume? I can't wait that long."
<es>

@957
<en>Miya seems to understand that, and he looked in distress.
<es>

@958
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The rock she ate is a special rock. It is said that the rock controls the death and regeneration."
<es>

@959
<en>The eternal youth stuff again. I really can't believe it.
<es>

@962
<en>{Amamiya}\n"That means, the rock gives an eternal life, and makes the dead be alive again."
<es>

@963
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The dead be alive again?"
<es>

@964
<en>That is ridiculous. And I'm scared of Miya and the principal for believing in that.
<es>

@965
<en>{Amamiya}\n"At least we were aiming for that. But the rock was taken by Natsume before the completion. We don't know how it affects people."
<es>

@966
<en>Because Natsume ate it before it was completed. How does this uncompleted rock affect on people?
<es>

@967
<en>And the fact that Natsume attacked on the principal with overwhelming power.
<es>

@970
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The legend say that the god who controls the eternal youth was a god who gives death to the people."
<es>

@971
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? That is completely opposite."
<es>

@973
<en>{Amamiya}\n"People thought if you pray to the god of death, then he may save you from it. And then, that lead to the belief that if you pray for this god, then he will give you an eternal life."
<es>

@975
<en>The god who controls the eternal life originally was a god of destruction and creation.
<es>

@976
<en>The god who destroy everything, and create totally new world. So, it also leads to the regeneration beliefs.
<es>

@977
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Hisae thinks the way Natsume acted is linked to this belief."
<es>

@978
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So you think Natsume harms other people? That is nonsense! Natsume will not do that!"
<es>

@981
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I know she is not like that. But, the power which lies inside of her may not be able to controlled by Natsume."
<es>

@982
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I'm not sure if I can stop her in case the power of the rock exceeds her will. I can't let Natsume become a murder."
<es>

@983
<en>Of course, I don't want Natsume to harm anyone. I understand his feeling.
<es>

@984
<en>But, the Natsume I know will never do that. I can't believe that there is a possibility of that.
<es>

@985
<en>He doesn't know about how Natsume is now. He could not know her. Because he have not seen her for a long time.
<es>

@986
<en>That is why he can't believe in her, even if he wants to.
<es>

@987
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I want her to lead a normal and peaceful life. That is why we need to be cautious about this."
<es>

@988
<en>Miya did not show tears. But, he looked like he was crying to me.
<es>

@989
<en>This is not right. This is not a good situation for Miya or Natsume.
<es>

@990
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We need to go get Natsume."
<es>

@991
<en>I can say so. Natsume will never harm other people. I know something Miya does not know.
<es>

@992
<en>I know how she is now. Natsume is just lonely in the empty world she's put in.
<es>

@993
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume is all alone now! Don't you need to protect her as a father?"
<es>

@994
<en>I yelled out unconsciously. Miya looked down sadly.
<es>

@996
<en>{Amamiya}\n"....."
<es>

@997
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I have no power. I can't do anything for her. Do I have a right to say that I'm her father?"
<es>

@998
<en>He poured it out bitterly. I see he's in agony about something. But I didn't feel sympathy for him.
<es>

@999
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I avoided her, when she came to visit me, and I can't wake her up from sleep she's put in. I'm not sure if I have a right to claim that I'm her father?"
<es>

@1000
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know much, but if you say you don't have a right, then maybe you should get that right, don't you?"
<es>

@1003
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What?"
<es>

@1004
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? If you are not licensed doctor, then maybe you need to quit being a doctor, but you can't quit being a parent."
<es>

@1007
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I guess..."
<es>

@1008
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, you just need to get the right. You are the only father Natsume have, and no one can replace you."
<es>

@1009
<en>{Amamiya}\n"...."
<es>

@1010
<en>I'm not sure what kind effect I had on him. But, Miya seems to lost words.
<es>

@1011
<en>{Amamiya}\n"....."
<es>

@1012
<en>Miya became silent for a long time. The sound of the clock was the only sound we could hear, and it was loud. Then, Miya inhaled suddenly.
<es>

@1015
<en>{Amamiya}\n"... Natsume was so sickly as a little girl. She was getting cold all the time and we were so worried about her all year around."
<es>

@1016
<en>He started to chat.
<es>

@1017
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I stayed home until she was four or five. I had a lab at home."
<es>

@1018
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume was in the lab all the time. She liked to see me working in the lab."
<es>

@1019
<en>{Amamiya}\n"She was using the furnace by the age of three. Maybe she learned by looking at me. I may sound stupid, but I think she has a talent in alchemy."
<es>

@1022
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The three of us were always together. Maybe it was the happiest time in my life."
<es>

@1023
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure you can go back to that life. So, let's go get Natsume."
<es>

@1026
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Kazushi, you are right. If I don't have a right to be a parent, then I have to get it."
<es>

@1027
<en>He smiled cynically.
<es>

@1030
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You can't quit being a parent, just because you don't have a right. That is so true. I wonder why I didn't think of that before."
<es>

@1031
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Smart people thinks too hard. Alchemist sounds like a smart people."
<es>

@1032
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I'm sure I'm the most idiot on this earth."
<es>

@1033
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The idiots acts without thinking."
<es>

@1034
<en>That is me. And I make so many mistakes doing that.
<es>

@1037
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Really... I guess I need to be more idiot to make people happy."
<es>

@1038
<en>He smiled sadly. But it was not in careless manner at all. It was more stronger than before.
<es>

@1039
<en>The stronger smile looked at me.
<es>

@1040
<en>{Amamiya}\n"OK. Let's go get Natsume."
<es>

@1041
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@1042
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I have made my decision. As her father I'll protect Natsume no matter what happens."
<es>

@1043
<en>Miya looked like a father already.
<es>

@1044
<en>Natsume! The father you were looking for is right here.
<es>

@1045
<en>I'll bring him to you now.
<es>

@1052
<en>The narrow stairs were leading into the darkness.
<es>

@1053
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume is here??"
<es>

@1054
<en>{Amamiya}\n"The place has been sealed severely. I'm not sure if we could open it..."
<es>

@1055
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We need to get her. We can't be whining now."
<es>

@1056
<en>{Amamiya}\n"You are right."
<es>

@1057
<en>I'm loosing the sense of time because of the darkness. And the spiral staircase confused me about the sense of distance.
<es>

@1058
<en>I'm not sure how far we have came down. It felt like it was leading to hell.
<es>

@1061
<en>Sound of foot step
<es>

@1062
<en>The sound of Miya's foot step changed. He has stepped on something different. Miya stopped.
<es>

@1063
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya?"
<es>

@1064
<en>{Amamiya}\n"This is it."
<es>

@1065
<en>He raised the lamp in his hand. There was a stone door. And we saw a huge lock hanging on the bar.
<es>

@1066
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Don't worry."
<es>

@1067
<en>He noticed me and nodded. He took out the huge ring full of keys. He picked one of them and put it into the lock.
<es>

@1069
<en>The sound of keys
<es>

@1070
<en>We heard a sound of the key opened.
<es>

@1071
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Let's go."
<es>

@1072
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK."
<es>

@1079
<en>We found her as soon as we entered the room.
<es>

@1080
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume!!"
<es>

@1081
<en>I found her! It is Natsume! I found her at last.
<es>

@1082

<es>

@1083
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume!!"
<es>

@1084
<en>I shook her shoulders. But she is not waking up.
<es>

@1086
<en>Slap. Slap.
<es>

@1087
<en>I slapped her cheeks.
<es>

@1088
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume! Wake up! We came to get you!!"
<es>

@1089
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume! Wake up!"
<es>

@1091
<en>{Natsume}\n"......."
<es>

@1092
<en>She is not waking up. No response at all.
<es>

@1093
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why?"
<es>

@1094
<en>{Amamiya}\n"She is no just sleeping. She is put in a state of apparent death to suspend the power of the rock."
<es>

@1095
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, how can we wake her up?"
<es>

@1096
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Maybe some kind of a shock will do."
<es>

@1097
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We have to punch her?"
<es>

@1098
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Not so violent..."
<es>

@1099
<en>That's right. I need calm down. I know. I have a better plan.
<es>

@1100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya, can you close your eyes?"
<es>

@1101
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What? My eyes?"
<es>

@1102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hurry!!"
<es>

@1103
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, OK..."
<es>

@1104
<en>Miya closed his eyes. I watched out for him and looked into the face of Natsume.
<es>

@1105
<en>I was thinking about the time I first met her in my dream.
<es>

@1106
<en>This time, it was totally opposite. Was she looking into my face like this?
<es>

@1107
<en>And then....
<es>

@1108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume."
<es>

@1109
<en>I called out for Natsume with all my heart. And got closed to her face.
<es>

@1110
<en>Haruka said Natsume and I have some kind of contract.
<es>

@1111
<en>Is that contract still in effect? I kissed her red lips. It looks like a red flower in her pale face.
<es>

@1112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......"
<es>

@1113
<en>I kissed her praying to blow my life into her.

<es>

@1120
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1121
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume!!"
<es>

@1124
<en>Natsume was standing alone in a middle of the windy field filled with flowers. Her long hair was blown by the wind. Are we in heaven?
<es>

@1125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume!"
<es>

@1126
<en>Natsume turned around.
<es>

@1129
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi. You again? So persistent."
<es>

@1130
<en>I understand now. I met her here long time ago. And I promised her here.
<es>

@1131
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I came to find you, just like I promised."
<es>

@1132

@1136
<en>{Natsume}\n"......."
<es>

@1137
<en>Natsume was just standing there. Not moving at all.
<es>

@1138
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1139
<en>{Natsume}\n"Can I leave here?"
<es>

@1140
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, sure. Let's go back to the world you came from."
<es>

@1143
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh....."
<es>

@1144
<en>But she is not moving.
<es>

@1145
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@1146
<en>Natsume is shaking little.
<es>

@1149
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm little bit scared of leaving here."
<es>

@1150
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why? What do you mean?"
<es>

@1151
<en>{Natsume}\n"That weird rock is inside of me. That powerful rock. I'm not sure what I will do with that rock."
<es>

@1152
<en>{Natsume}\n"And my dad may reject me again."
<es>

@1153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You sound like a wimp for once."
<es>

@1154
<en>Natsume looked up and pouted her lips.
<es>

@1157
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'll be scared when I have to decide something important."
<es>

@1158
<en>She looks more girlish than usual. It made me smile.
<es>

@1161
<en>{Natsume}\n"What are you smiling about?"
<es>

@1162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm glad to find out you are a regular girl."
<es>

@1165
<en>That surprised Natsume for some reason.
<es>

@1166
<en>{Natsume}\n"Do you think I'm a regular girl?"
<es>

@1167
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure. At first I was kind of worried that you might be this great girl everyone was talking about,then I have no chance but you are an ordinary girl."
<es>

@1168
<en>Natsume is so small. I'm not sure if she has this great power or not, but she still is an ordinary girl in her age.
<es>

@1169
<en>I want to protect her. The strong will was coming up inside of me.
<es>

@1170
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry. Nobody is going to harm you, and you are not going to harm anyone."
<es>

@1171
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You know everybody, don't you? Appo-, Pierre and Daigo. Haruka and Mizuki and other girls."
<es>

@1172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They all helped me and supported me. They are all waiting for you. So, I have to bring you back to where we came from."
<es>

@1173
<en>{Kazushi}\n"And Miya... your dad swore he'll protect you as well."
<es>

@1176
<en>{Natsume}\n"My dad?"
<es>

@1177
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. He said he wants to be your father for real this time. So, Let's go."
<es>

@1180
<en>I took her hand. Natsume looked up as I pulled her hand.
<es>

@1181
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's go."
<es>

@1182
<en>I smiled to her.
<es>

@1185
<en>{Natsume}\n"...... OK."
<es>

@1187
<en>The wind blew on us hard again.
<es>

@1192
<en>I was still kissing Natsume while Miya continued to close his eyes. Maybe everything happened in a second.
<es>

@1193
<en>{Natsume}\n"....Mm."
<es>

@1194
<en>Natsume's lips moved a little. It felt like her breath was coming into me from where our lips met.
<es>

@1195
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm... Mm..."
<es>

@1196
<en>Her cold body was becoming warmer. It seemed like the life came out from somewhere and filled her little body with it.
<es>

@1198
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ha...."
<es>

@1199
<en>She let her breath out from a lip which looked like a rose. I let my lips go.
<es>

@1200
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume!!"
<es>

@1201
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume? Natsume?"
<es>

@1202
<en>Miya opened his eyes and called for Natsume. Her long eye lashes moved a little.
<es>

@1203
<en>{Natsume}\n"....."
<es>

@1204
<en>Then, she opened her eyes.
<es>

@1205
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume!!"
<es>

@1206
<en>I called her name. Natsume frowned.
<es>

@1207
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi, you are too loud."
<es>

@1208
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Sorry."
<es>

@1209
<en>She is mad at me. Natsume is rubbing her eyes like she is still sleepy.
<es>

@1210
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How do you feel? Is anything different?"
<es>

@1211
<en>{Natsume}\n"What is different?"
<es>

@1212
<en>She placed her hand on her chest.
<es>

@1213
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ouch!"
<es>

@1214
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Natsume?"
<es>

@1215
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume??"
<es>

@1216
<en>{Natsume}\n"Blood.... Blood!"
<es>

@1217
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Blood?"
<es>

@1218
<en>Is she controlled by the power of the rock?
<es>

@1219
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Kazushi, step back."
<es>

@1220
<en>Miya stepped in front of me.
<es>

@1221
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I'll save you no matter what."
<es>

@1222
<en>The air became tense. Natsume!!
<es>

@1223
<en>{Natsume}\n"Aha! I'm just joking!"
<es>

@1224
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What?"
<es>

@1225
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Joking?"
<es>

@1226
<en>Natsume stuck her tongue out. That was Natsume I knew... or little bit more mischievous?
<es>

@1227
<en>{Natsume}\n"I feel fine. Maybe my boobs are bigger."
<es>

@1228
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Are you sure? How do you feel?"
<es>

@1229
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm fine. I'm not going to be a murder."
<es>

@1230
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, good."
<es>

@1231
<en>I felt relaxed. That is the Natsume I know. For sure.
<es>

@1232
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Man. You scared me."
<es>

@1233
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi, it's because you took so long to get here. It has been half a month since then."
<es>

@1234
<en>She glared at me with sleepy eyes. She had tears in her eyes, so it was not as scary.
<es>

@1235
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry. But I did find you at last."
<es>

@1236
<en>I only knew her in my dream, and the shadow of her. But I finally met with real Natsume.
<es>

@1237
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes. Finally."
<es>

@1238
<en>Natsume laughed. Her smile made me so happy I hugged her in front of Miya.
<es>

@1239
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume!!"
<es>

@1240
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ouch! I can't breath."
<es>

@1241
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, sorry."
<es>

@1242
<en>Maybe it was too hard. She looked up in my arms. And her eyes stopped at once place.
<es>

@1246
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh...."
<es>

@1251
<en>Miya froze as Natsume looks at him. She withered him instantly, it's hard to believe he was so brave a second ago.
<es>

@1252
<en>{Natsume}\n"....."
<es>

@1253
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Well....."
<es>

@1254
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya, you got to say something."
<es>

@1257
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Well... Ah..."
<es>

<es>

<es>

@1262

<es>

@1263
<en>She cling to his neck and yelled out.
<es>

@1264
<en>{Natsume}\n"Stupid! Worthless man! That's why mommy ran away from you."
<es>

@1267
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Sorry. Well, I'm sure it's not enough."
<es>

@1270
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mommy died."
<es>

@1273
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What?"
<es>

@1274
<en>{Natsume}\n"I came here to tell you that."
<es>

@1277
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Is that so?"
<es>

@1278
<en>Miya gave Natsume a hug.
<es>

@1279
<en>{Amamiya}\n"I'm sorry. I'm sorry Natsume."
<es>

@1282
<en>{Natsume}\n"Stupid. I can't breath. You stink."
<es>

@1283
<en>Natsume wiggles in Miya's arms. She is crying but trying to hide it by acting mad.
<es>

@1284
<en>But, Miya didn't let her go, and Natsume was in his arms.
<es>

@1285
<en>I don't know how long it went on...
<es>

@1288
<en>{Natsume}\n"....."
<es>

@1291
<en>Natsume looked up and our eyes met.
<es>

@1292
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Welcome back."
<es>

@1293
<en>It just came out naturally. Natsume looked surprised at first, but then smiled.
<es>

@1294
<en>It was a first time to see her smile like that.
<es>

@1297
<en>{Natsume}\n"yeah. I'm back."
<es>

@1298
<en>That was how we met for the first time, but it was a second time around.
<es>

@1305
<en>{Appo-}\n"There they are!"
<es>

@1306

<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh my god! She is 35% more plumper than the fake one."
<es>

@1320
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hey, don't touch my cheeks. Don't come close to me."
<es>

<es>

@1325
<en>{Natsume}\n"I can't see. Daddy!"

@1330
<en>{Amamiya}\n"What?"
<es>

@1332
<en>Natsume jumped on Miya's back and climbed up to his shoulder like a monkey. She is riding on his shoulder.
<es>

<en>{Amamiya}\n"Wow! Natsume, you are heavy."

@1334
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes. I can see better. Come on. Go. Hurry."
<es>

@1335
<en>{Amamiya}\n"Oh, OK..."
<es>

@1336
<en>Miya is skinny and he is staggering. But you can tell he is concentrating on not to let go Natsume as hard as he can.
<es>

@1337
<en>It was like he was trying to be the best dad he can be.
<es>

@1338
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Man. I'm jealous."
<es>

@1339

<es>

@1340
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh...."
<es>

@1341
<en>I looked up for no reason, and found a silhouette of a person by the window of the lab building.
<es>

@1342
<en>It was the principal. She had a smile on her face and looking down on Natsume and everybody else.
<es>

<es>

@1345
<en>It seems like everything came too easy, now I think about it.
<es>
