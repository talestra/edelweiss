<en>The time has passed so quickly---
<es>

@11
<en>---Dozens of years later.
<es>

@13
<en>{Principal}\n"Greetings, everyone. I am Hisae Aozora, the principal of this academy. I will be spending the next 3 years with you at this academy............."
<es>

@15
<en>I have become a teacher at the Eiden academy.
<es>

@18
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"I never thought you would become a teacher, Kazushi. Oh, pardon me, I should call you Mr.Haruma, huh?"
<es>

@19
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ha, ha, ha. Yes, maybe in front of the students, that would be better."
<es>

@21
<en>I will be teaching Alchemy.
<es>

@22
<en>The reason why I chose to teach Alchemy is not because I wanted to revive Mei or anything like that. I just wanted to follow her footsteps.
<es>

@23
<en>And this was the only school I could teach the subject, so I really didn't have a choice other than this school for the employment.
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder how long it has been......"
<es>

@27
<en>Nothing has changed. Kind of a sour smell of the old books. Even the books on the shelves are almost exactly what I remember.
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nobody is here........."
<es>

@29
<en>And I guess this place still is as unpopular as it was before.
<es>

@30
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Gee, read some books, guys........."
<es>

@31
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh......"
<es>

@33
<en>There is someone. There is someone reading a book by the window.
<es>

@34
<en>I wonder what grade she is in? She has a beautiful and rather mature looking profile.
<es>

@36
<en>{The girl}\n"Oh......"
<es>

@37
<en>Maybe she sensed me looking at her, she lifted her face.
<es>

@38
<en>{The girl}\n"Hello."
<es>

@39
<en>She greeted me.
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, amm, hello."
<es>

@41
<en>I stuttered. Why am I nervous?
<es>

@42
<en>{The girl}\n"You are.......the new alchemy teacher, right?"
<es>

@43
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yes."
<es>

@44
<en>She probably remembers my face from the beginning of the semester ceremony.
<es>

@45
<en>{The girl}\n"It is such a coincidence, don't you think?"
<es>

@46
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What are you talking about?"
<es>

@47
<en>{The girl}\n"You are Mr.Haruma, right? My name is Haruma also."
<es>

@48
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@49
<en>That is a coincidence. I didn't think Haruma is such popular name. There were 2 Harumas at most in one grade when I was a student.
<es>

@51
<en>{Haruma}\n"When I heard your name at the ceremony, I was surprised."
<es>

@52
<en>She smiled childishly with her mature looking face.
<es>

@53
<en>She has a very mysterious charm that is like a mixture or a matureness and a childishness together at the same time.
<es>

@54
<en>{Haruma}\n"Do you like books too?"
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I guess. I was a student librarian back when I was a student."
<es>

@56
<en>{Haruma}\n"Oh, that's right, you graduated from here, right? I am a student librarian too."
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You too? Gosh, this is truly a coincidence."
<es>

@58
<en>A coincidence does happen. All of a sudden, I feel so close to her.
<es>

@59
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Calling you Haruma feels strange......."
<es>

@60
<en>It does feel weired calling someone by my own last name.
<es>

@61
<en>{Haruma}\n"Then, you can call me by my first name."
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is your first name?"
<es>

@65
<en>{Saki}\n"Saki. Saki Haruma. This is my second year here. Nice to meet you."
<es>

@66
<en>She bowed. I just stood there.
<es>

@67
<en>Saki Haruma. I gave that name to Mei when she begged.
<es>

@68
<en>After it spouts, then the flower comes. That was the meaning behind the name.
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......................"
<es>

@70
<en>This is a coincident.
<es>

@71
<en>Reincarnation?
<es>

@72
<en>No, she couldn't have chosen her own name, that can't be.
<es>

@73
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......................"
<es>

@74
<en>{Saki}\n"Mr.Haruma? Are you OK?"
<es>

@75
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yes, I'm OK."
<es>

@76
<en>I just realized that I was staring at her. I looked away in a hurry.
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry. I was thinking you look just like someone I know."
<es>

@78
<en>I wonder? Does she really look like her? Well, maybe not, this must be just a coincidence.
<es>

@79
<en>Yer, that's all. But even if it was a coincidence, it made me happy.
<es>

@80
<en>{Saki}\n"Are you talking about your old lover?"
<es>

@81
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, something like that."
<es>

@82
<en>{Saki}\n"Really? Wow!!"
<es>

@83
<en>I guess girls at this age like that kind of subject. Her eyes are all of a sudden sparkly.
<es>

@84
<en>{Saki}\n"You really liked that person, right? Mr.Haruma......what is it like to be in love?"
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@86
<en>What a beloved question. Is this question a coincidence too? At the time, I tried to find an answer to that exact question with her.
<es>

@87
<en>But now, I can proudly say it.
<es>

@88
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's see, being in love is like............."
<es>
