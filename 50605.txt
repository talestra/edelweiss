<en>The time has passed so quickly---
<es>

@11
<en>---Dozens of years later.
<es>

@13
<en>{Principal}\n"Greetings, everyone. I am Aozora Hisae, the principal of this academy. For the next three years, we will all be living together here at this academy..."
<es>

@15
<en>I've become a teacher at Eiden Academy.
<es>

@18
<en>{Yagami}\n"Who'd have thought Kazushi would become a teacher. Oh, I guess I should be calling you Haruma-sensei now, huh?"
<es>

@19
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahaha, at least in front of the students, please."
<es>

@21
<en>I'll be in charge of teaching Alchemy.
<es>

@22
<en>The reason why I chose to teach Alchemy isn't because I wanted to revive Mei or anything like that. I just wanted to follow in her footsteps.
<es>

@23
<en>And that meant this was the only academy I could be employed at, so naturally I came back here.
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's been a long time."
<es>

@27
<en>The room hadn't changed a bit. It still had the sour smell of old books... Even the books on the shelves were hardly any different from what I remembered.
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No one's here, huh?"
<es>

@29
<en>This place was still as unpopular as ever.
<es>

@30
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Jeez, read some books, guys........."
<es>

@31
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh......"
<es>

@33
<en>There is someone - a girl - reading books in a chair by the windowsill.
<es>

@34
<en>I wonder what year she's in? She has a beautiful and rather mature looking profile.
<es>

@36
<en>{The girl}\n"Oh......?"
<es>

@37
<en>She looked up from her book after sensing my eyes on her.
<es>

@38
<en>{The girl}\n"Hello."
<es>

@39
<en>She greeted me.
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"H-hello."
<es>

@41
<en>I stuttered. Why am I nervous?
<es>

@42
<en>{The girl}\n"Umm... you're the new alchemy teacher, right?"
<es>

@43
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yes."
<es>

@44
<en>She probably remembered my face from the beginning of the opening ceremony.
<es>

@45
<en>{The girl}\n"Umm, it's such a coincidence, isn't it?"
<es>

@46
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What is?"
<es>

@47
<en>{The girl}\n"Sensei, your name is Haruma, right? My name is Haruma too."
<es>

@48
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Really?"
<es>

@49
<en>That really is a coincidence. Haruma's not that common of a name, is it? I've never met another Haruma in the same grade as me.
<es>

@51
<en>{Haruma}\n"When I heard your name at the ceremony, I was surprised."
<es>

@52
<en>Despite her mature looking face, she had a childish smile. The girl had a strange mix of mature and youthful attractiveness.
<es>

@53
<en>{Haruma}\n"Do you like books too, sensei?"
<es>

@54
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I suppose so. I used to be a librarian here back in the day."
<es>

@55
<en>{Haruma}\n"Oh, you graduated from here? I'm a librarian too."
<es>

@56
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You too? This really is a coincidence."
<es>

@57
<en>Coincidences do happen together. I suddenly felt a sense of closeness to her.
<es>

@58
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, Haruma... er, it's hard to call you that."
<es>

@59
<en>It does feel weird calling someone by my own last name.
<es>

@60
<en>{Haruma}\n"Then, you can call me by my first name."
<es>

@61
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is your first name?"
<es>

@64
<en>{Saki}\n"Saki. Haruma Saki, sophomore. Nice to meet you."
<es>

@65
<en>She bowed politely. I found myself just standing there.
<es>

@66
<en>Haruma Saki - that was the name I gave Mei when she asked me for one.
<es>

@67
<en>Her name came from the thought I had - that the next stage for a flower after it sprouts (Mei), is to bloom (Saku).
<es>

@68
<en>{Kazushi}\n"....................."
<es>

@69
<en>This is a coincidence, isn't it?
<es>

@70
<en>Reincarnation?
<es>

@71
<en>No, she couldn't have chosen her own name. It can't be.
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"....................."
<es>

@73
<en>{Saki}\n"Um, sensei? What's wrong?"
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh... nothing..."
<es>

@75
<en>I just realized that I was staring at her. I looked away in a hurry.
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry. I was thinking you look just like someone I know."
<es>

@77
<en>What is it, really? She doesn't particularly look like her, I guess. It must be a coincidence.
<es>

@78
<en>Yes, just a coincidence. But even so, that coincidence made me rather happy.
<es>

@79
<en>{Saki}\n"Is the person I look like perhaps your old lover?"
<es>

@80
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Yeah, something like that."
<es>

@81
<en>{Saki}\n"What? It really is? Wow, amazing."
<es>

@82
<en>I guess girls at this age like that kind of subject. Her eyes were shining already.
<es>

@83
<en>{Saki}\n"Sensei, you loved that person, didn't you? Umm... what's like to be in love?"
<es>

@84
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh...?"
<es>

@85
<en>What a nostalgic question. Is this question another coincidence too? It was the question we both tried to find the answer to together.
<es>

@86
<en>But now I can proudly answer it.
<es>

@87
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's see. Being in love is like............"
<es>
