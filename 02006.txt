<en>{Appo}\n"You think I've become abnormal?"
<es>

@10
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're not abnormal. Well, I mean, you've never been normal in your entire life, but aside from that you're not."
<es>

@13
<en>{Appo}\n"That's hard to understand. Well, so long as I haven't changed or anything."
<es>

@18
<en>{Pierre}\n"Are you sure you wanted us to come along? Wouldn't you rather be alone with her?"
<es>

@21
<en>{Appo}\n"You idiot! Are you going to abandon me?! And you call yourself a friend?!"
<es>

@28
<en>{Daigo}\n"It's because we're your friends that we're trying to be considerate."
<es>

@29
<en>{Appo}\n"No!\nI wouldn't know what to talk to her about if you guys left us alone."
<es>

@30
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right. Just for today, OK?"
<es>

@31
<en>Today is the first Sunday since they started going out.
<es>

@32
<en>This is their first proper date.
<es>

@33
<en>{Pierre}\n"I didn't know you were such a scaredy cat, Appo. You should meet up for a date by yourself."
<es>

@34
<en>{Appo}\n"Don't act so cold! You're a friend, aren't you?! You're killing me!!"
<es>

@37
<en>{Pierre}\n"Why are you getting so mad?"
<es>

@40
<en>{Daigo}\n"His head's all full. With Fuusen."
<es>

@43
<en>{Appo}\n"Kazuko-san is running late.\nI hope she hasn't gotten into an accident or anything like that."
<es>

@44
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Kazuko-san?!"
<es>

@47
<en>{Pierre}\n"Talk about a total 180."
<es>

@48
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know."
<es>

@49
<en>Until just a few days ago, Appo didn't even treat her like a human being. Now he worshipped her like a goddess.
<es>

@55
<en>{Fuusen}\n"I'm sorry, I'm late."
<es>

@59
<en>{Appo}\n"Ah!"
<es>

@64
<en>Appo froze at Fuusen's graceful voice. Hearing her sound like that certainly gave me the shivers too.
<es>

@65
<en>{Appo}\n"Good morning, Kazuko-san!"
<es>

@68
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Good morning.\nDid I make you wait?"
<es>

@69
<en>{Appo}\n"Not at all!\nWe just got here, too!"
<es>

@70
<en>Silly Appo, getting panicky over Fuusen. The girls who came along with her were laughing from behind her.
<es>

@79
<en>{Haruka}\n"Good morning.\nIt's a perfect day for......"
<es>

@80
<en>{Ran}\n"Stop that greeting. This isn't some marriage interview."
<es>

@81
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Are you sure we should all hang out together?\nThis is their first date."
<es>

@89
<en>{Fuusen}\n"A date? Our main goal today is shopping. Nothing wrong with everyone going."
<es>

@90
<en>{Appo}\n"And Kazuko-san is going to show us around the island."
<es>

@99
<en>{Haruka}\n"You haven't really been shown around yet after all. There are some things you can't buy at school, right?"
<es>

@100
<en>{Daigo}\n"Yeah, I want to go to a bookstore."
<es>

@101
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh yeah, I've just about gone through all the ones I brought too. There is a bookstore, right?"
<es>

@105
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wow, I would've never guessed you were all avid readers."
<es>

@106
<en>Except the books they're buying are just pin-up magazines. I should probably grab one too.
<es>

@114
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Shall we?"
<es>

@115
<en>{Appo}\n"Let's go."
<es>

@116
<en>Appo and Fuusen walked off side-by-side. They looked scarily good together.
<es>

@123
<en>{Ran}\n"From back here, they look like a perfect match."
<es>

@124
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I know. It's like destiny."
<es>

@129
<en>The first store they led us to was an ordinary looking store we'd never been to. The signboard read "Belly-Splitter". What the hell kind of name is that.
<es>

@134
<en>{Appo}\n"What kind of a store is this?"
<es>

@135
<en>{Fuusen}\n"A general store, I guess? You can buy anything from daily goods to Alchemy supplies."
<es>

@140
<en>{Haruka}\n"Originally this store sold exclusively Alchemy supplies, but at some point they started carrying other things too."
<es>

@141
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, alchemy supplies?"
<es>

@142
<en>This store did? It didn't look like it.
<es>

@146
<en>{Ran}\n"Let's go in. Hello! Pops, you in?"
<es>

@150
<en>A man came out from the back room as we entered. I probably shouldn't say it, but he was a dull-looking, middle aged man.
<es>

@155
<en>{Store Owner}\n"Oh, Ran-chan, hello. Oh? Quite a few with you today."
<es>

@158
<en>{Ran}\n"I've brought you some business, so give me a cut, OK?"
<es>

@161
<en>{Store Owner}\n"Hahaha, I can't compete with you, Ran-chan."
<es>

@169
<en>He turned towards us as he scratched his head. Beneath his glasses rested a pair of thin eyes and a gentle smile.
<es>

@170
<en>{Store Owner}\n"You must be the new boys. I'm really glad to have more men on the island. There's not much to talk about with just young women."
<es>

@171
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hello."
<es>

@172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nice to meet you!"
<es>

@173
<en>{Store Owner}\n"Nice to meet you too.\nHow can I help you today? We have just about everything you could need."
<es>

@180
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Miya-san, actually......"
<es>

@181
<en>Fuusen leaned up close and whispered in his ear. I guess his name's Miya-san.
<es>

@184
<en>{Fuusen}\n"...do you have any?"
<es>

@187
<en>For some reason, the store owner's face turned red.
<es>

@188
<en>{Miya}\n"Yes, but... are you going to use them?"
<es>

@189
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Yes, they're for him..."
<es>

@196
<en>Fuusen grabbed Appo by the arm.
<es>

@197
<en>{Fuusen}\n"He's really healthy."
<es>

@200
<en>{Appo}\n"Yes, I am very healthy!"
<es>

@201
<en>{Miya}\n"I-I see. Good. Umm... have fun."
<es>

@202
<en>Miya-san was acting weird. What did Fuusen order from him?
<es>

@208
<en>{Miya}\n"Umm, well. I'll go wrap them up. How many did you need?"
<es>

@211
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Hmmm... We'll use a lot anyways, so give us a dozen."
<es>

@214
<en>{Miya}\n"A dozen boxes...\nEach box has 12...\nYou really want 12 boxes!?"
<es>

@215
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Yup, 144 should be enough for a month."
<es>

@216
<en>{Miya}\n"Enough for a MONTH!?"
<es>

@220
<en>For some reason the store owner was looking jealously at Appo.
<es>

@221
<en>{Miya}\n"How wonderful to be young..."
<es>

@222
<en>{Appo}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@225
<en>{Miya}\n"I'll go get them, so please wait a moment."
<es>

@228
<en>The store owner disappeared into the back room.
<es>

@233
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hey, Kazuko-chan, what'd you buy?"
<es>

@236
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Something in great demand amongst couples."
<es>

@240
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? You mean..."
<es>

@241
<en>Mizuki's face turned bright red. For someone who doesn't like dirty topics, she always picked up on them.
<es>

@248
<en>{Pierre}\n"Are you really going to buy those on your first date? I can't tell if that's sexy or not."
<es>

@249
<en>{Daigo}\n"Appo, are you really going to do it 144 times in a month? I'm jealous."
<es>

@250
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's almost summer, too. We need to try harder."
<es>

@253
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah. Better find a partner soon so we don't end up wasting our summer."
<es>

@256
<en>{Daigo}\n"I-I'll find one. I'll find one."
<es>

@261
<en>{Miya}\n"Thanks for waiting."
<es>

@262
<en>He returned from the storeroom. He looked like just a regular merchant.
<es>

@263
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you an alchemist, too?"
<es>

@264
<en>It was bugging me, so I asked. He must be if he owns an alchemy store.
<es>

@267
<en>{Miya}\n"Well, just a small-time one. I'm not very knowledgeable either, so please don't ask me much when you're shopping."
<es>

@268
<en>He scratched his head with a pained smile. No offense, but he doesn't really look like a good one either.
<es>

@273
<en>{Haruka}\n"Miya-san, you're so modest."
<es>

@274
<en>Haruka teased him.
<es>

@275
<en>{Kazushi}\n"He's good, then?"
<es>

@278
<en>{Haruka}\n"Of course. He's the--"
<es>

@281
<en>{Miya}\n"You don't have to tell him.\nIs there anything else I can help you guys with?"
<es>

@282
<en>He didn't seem to want to talk about it. He looked like an average person, but maybe he wasn't?
<es>

@286
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@287
<en>His face looked so familiar.
<es>

@288
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Have we met before?"
<es>

@289
<en>I had a sense of deja vu, like we'd met before...
<es>

@290
<en>{Miya}\n"Have we?...I don't recall it?"
<es>

@291
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I suppose you're right. I don't recall it either."
<es>

@294
<en>{Miya}\n"Huh? What's with that?"
<es>

@295
<en>He started laughing.\nBut... I still felt like I'd met him before somewhere.
<es>

@296
<en>Maybe he looks someone I know. But who?
<es>

@300
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Haruka!\nLet's go!"
<es>

@305
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sorry, girls. I have to go visit grandma."
<es>

@306
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, okay. That's a shame."
<es>

@307
<en>{Haruka}\n"We'll do this again sometime!"
<es>

@308
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure."
<es>

@313
<en>I turned back to the store owner.
<es>

@314
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry for saying something so strange."
<es>

@315
<en>{Miya}\n"It's OK. It's been a while since I've talked to some young guys. Come back again some time."
<es>

@316
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good bye."
<es>

@321
<en>{Haruka}\n"Bye."
<es>

@322
<en>After Haruka's bright goodbye, Miya-san saw us off with a gentle smile.
<es>

@323
<en>Miya-san, huh?
<es>

@326
<en>He's a strange man.
<es>

@333
<en>{Appo}\n"Sorry, guys. We've actually got something to take care of."
<es>

@334
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You'll have to excuse us."
<es>

@335
<en>For two people who said they had to head back, they sure were acting fidgety.
<es>

@340
<en>{Ran}\n"You have to leave now? Both of you?"
<es>

@346
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Actually, we have to take care of it together."
<es>

@347
<en>Fuusen was holding her new purchase in her hand. I guess they were already in the mood.
<es>

@350
<en>{Appo}\n"See you, guys! Alright, let's go."
<es>

@353
<en>{Fuusen}\n"I can't wait any longer!"
<es>

@356
<en>{Appo}\n"Then let's do it somewhere close!!"
<es>

@359
<en>They quickly disappeared into a back street.
<es>

@362
<en>{Pierre}\n"I hope they get caught finishing their business and arrested."
<es>

@367
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Finish their business? ...Hey, cut that out!"
<es>

@370
<en>{Pierre}\n"What should we do now?"
<es>

@374
<en>{Daigo}\n"I wanna go back to my room."
<es>

@375
<en>Daigo was hugging the bag of stuff he bought from the bookstore. I guess he's in the mood too.
<es>

@376
<en>{Pierre}\n"Why are you getting excited already? Where they selling something that amazing?"
<es>

@379
<en>{Daigo}\n"Y-yeah, they were. You won't believe it."
<es>

@380
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? That good?"
<es>

@383
<en>{Pierre}\n"......should we go home, too?"
<es>

@388
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Everyone's going home."
<es>

@393
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Why don't we call it a day, then?\nThere's somewhere I want to stop on my way back."
<es>

@394
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right. Then let's call it a day."
<es>

@399
<en>{Daigo}\n"I'm going home!"
<es>

@404
<en>{Pierre}\n"What are you going to do, Kazushi?"
<es>

@405
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well......"
<es>
