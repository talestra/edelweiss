@7
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I am so tired."
<es>

@8
<en>After taking a shower, I just fall down into my futon. I feel tired and comfortable at the same time.
<es>

@11
<en>{Appo-}\n"I heard you went home. How did you get back?"
<es>

@12
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah..By boat. I asked a fisher man to get me across the sea."
<es>

@15
<en>{Appo-}\n"Really? That easy to leave this place?"
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, but the boat got so shaky once it got away from the shore. The boat could have been capsized. In fact, it was almost miracle it didn't."
<es>

@17
<en>The worst part was a storm last night. Remembering that even makes me throw up.
<es>

@18
<en>{Kazushi}\n"At one point I thought that was it. I couldn't see anything with high waves as high as 10 meters over me."
<es>

@19
<en>I got thrown out of the boat a few times.
<es>

@22
<en>{Appo-}\n"Oh, No! I don't want it. I would rather stay here for ever. I don't want to go through that hell again."
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I remember you got a pretty bad boat sick."
<es>

@24
<en>I took a ferry to come here for the first time, but it still shook pretty bad. So I would imagine how bad it is in a fishing boat.
<es>

@27
<en>{Appo-}\n"Besides, now that I have Fusen here, I don't mind living here with her for good."
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But Fusen is not from this island, right? She may leave here eventually, I guess."
<es>

@31
<en>{Appo-}\n"If so, I will leave here too. Plus, by that time we leave here, we may be able to travel anywhere we want like "jumper"in a movie."
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's very unlikely."
<es>

@33
<en>At least in the next 100 years...
<es>

@34
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So you are going to Fusen's room today?"
<es>

@35
<en>Appo gives me a suggestive smile back.
<es>

@40
<en>{Appo-}\n"Are you asking whether you can be alone in the room again today? Who are you gonna bring in?"
<es>

@41
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't read between lines. I don't think about that all the time."
<es>

@42
<en>{Appo-}\n"Oh, I see."
<es>

@43
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I mean girls don't like boys thinking that stuff all the time, right?"
<es>

@46
<en>{Appo-}\n"You think so? It's healthy for the young couple to think about that stuff all the time. In fact, Fusen and I think about that stuff all the time, you know?"
<es>

@47
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? Fusen too? All girls like that?"
<es>

@50
<en>{Appo-}\n"The gender difference doesn't matter. When we first started going out, we fucked seven times a day."
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fuck! That many?!"
<es>

@52
<en>35 times...no 49 times a week?! Fuck!
<es>

@53
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can you guys do that many..?"
<es>

@54
<en>It's amazing. Before I knew it, my friend has gone way ahead in the game.
<es>

@57
<en>{Appo-}\n"At first I was counting, but stopped doing that because I realized important in a relationship is not quantity, but quality. Know what I mean?"
<es>

@58
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see. But I am still wondering if all the girls out there also want to fuck as much as the boys."
<es>

@61
<en>{Appo-}\n"Of course, women have the same sexual desire as men. Fusen sometimes asks me for sex, you know?"
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She does?"
<es>

@63
<en>Does Ran also think about fucking as much as I do? To come to think of it, it was Ran that wanted to do it first. Maybe I should take the lead next time.
<es>

@64
<en>Maybe she is waiting for me to ask. Ran may be frustrated because I get too chicken to ask.
<es>

@65
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@66
<en>But we just did it this morning. It may be a little too much to ask on the same night.
<es>

@67
<en>She also said she feels some pain in there.
<es>

@68
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm...."
<es>

@71
<en>{Appo-}\n"Don't think. Feel it. Act as you feel."
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Listen, if I act as I feel, I can't control it. Then probably, she would hate me."
<es>

@75
<en>{Appo-}\n"If she really loves you, she will accept you. She may be thinking of the same thing."
<es>

@76
<en>Will she accept me if she loves me? I can accept her because I love her.
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Appo is right. It's a great piece of advice. By the way, are you the same Appo as before?"
<es>

@80
<en>{Appo-}\n"Hahahah. I've changed because of love with Fusen. Call me a love missionary Appo."
<es>

@81
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I trust you?"
<es>

@82
<en>I squint at the bright sunshine right behind Appo. Appo gives me a God-like smile.
<es>

@83
<en>{Appo-}\n"Trust me. And follow me."
<es>

@84
<en>Appo casts a look at me like an enlighten monk. I feel very empowered and encouraged.
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay, thanks!"
<es>

@89
<en>I rush out to the door.
<es>

@92
<en>{Appo-}\n"Good luck, Kazushi!"
<es>

@97
<en>{Appo-}\n"Okay, now I can get Fusen over here."
<es>

@103
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huff Huff Huff..."
<es>

@105
<en>I run toward the female dorm.
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Gee...I don't know her room."
<es>

@107
<en>I have never been to the female dorm because we are not allowed in there.
<es>

@108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Should I sneak in?"
<es>

@109
<en>I see the lights on. People will notice me if I just walk around in there. Then I get into a big trouble.
<es>

@110
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wish I could know at least her room number."
<es>

@111
<en>From outside, I look at the windows with the lights on. One open window catches my eyes.
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@118
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmm? Kazushi?"
<es>

@119
<en>Ran is right by the window. It seems she just took a shower or something. Her wet hair makes her look so hot. She must be looking up at the night sky.
<es>

@120
<en>I am getting excited by her sexy look and this coincidence.
<es>

@123
<en>{Ran}\n"What a coincidence! What are you doing here at this time around?"
<es>

@124
<en>Ran sounds a bit perplexed, and excited.
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, nothing...I was just wondering how you are doing."
<es>

@128
<en>{Ran}\n"So you came to see me?"
<es>

@129
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't expect to see you this easy. I was just thinking how to sneak in there."
<es>

@132
<en>{Ran}\n"Sneak in here? You are such a risk-taker. But I like it!"
<es>

@133
<en>Ran smiles. And I give her a smile with a sigh of relief.
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good to know you like it."
<es>

@135
<en>When I look up, I see a full moon in the night sky. It sends away a dazzling moonlight.
<es>

@138
<en>{Ran}\n"Because it's a full moon?"
<es>

@139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe...A man will turn into a wolf on the full moon."
<es>

@142
<en>Ran leans out of the window.
<es>

@143
<en>{Ran}\n"Wanna come up here?"
<es>

@144
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is it okay?"
<es>

@147
<en>{Ran}\n"I will help you..."
<es>

@148
<en>{Mei}\n"It's not okay!!"
<es>

@149
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@154
<en>Another window down from Ran's room just opens. Ms. Ibuki looks out.
<es>

@155
<en>{Ran}\n"You caught us, Ms. Ibuki..."
<es>

@156
<en>{Mei}\n"It's not very difficult to know since you are talking so loud by the window."
<es>

@157
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That makes sense."
<es>

@160
<en>{Ran}\n"Okay, then. Ms. Ibuki, can Kazushi come to my room?"
<es>

@163
<en>{Mei}\n"Of course not!"
<es>

@166
<en>{Ran}\n"Hahaha. Of course, no. I will be out there then!"
<es>

@167
<en>Ran hands on the window frame.
<es>

@170
<en>{Mei}\n"Wait, it's already after curfew..."
<es>

@171
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, catch me!!"
<es>

@172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Catch you...?"
<es>

@175
<en>Ran jumps out of the window - - with no hesitation.
<es>

@176
<en>{Mei}\n"Ran!!"
<es>

@177
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!!"
<es>

@178
<en>I rush over the falling spot and try to grab her with my arms.
<es>

@181
<en>{Ran}\n"Here I come!"
<es>

@182
<en>With her arms out, Ran falls down on me.
<es>

@183
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!!"
<es>

@186
<en>Thud!! My rescue mission failed. Both of us fell down flat on the ground.
<es>

@187
<en>{Mei}\n"Ran! Kazushi!!"
<es>

@188
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh...It hurts..."
<es>

@189
<en>We both fell over pretty bad, but the damage was minimal because we fell on a flower bed with soft sand covered.
<es>

@192
<en>{Ran}\n"Hahahaha. You get so muddy now, Kazushi."
<es>

@193
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who do you think started this?...Puke. puke!!"
<es>

@197
<en>{Mei}\n"Hey guys! Are you two okay?"
<es>

@198
<en>From the window on the 3rd floor, Ms. Ibuki is anxiously looking down at us. It looks like she even jumps down here as well.
<es>

@199
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We...we are okay...sort of..."
<es>

@203
<en>{Ran}\n"Dirt all over..."
<es>

@204
<en>Ran answers with the dirt on her face. Ms. Ibuki sighs deeply with relief.
<es>

@208
<en>{Mei}\n"You two hit it off pretty well, huh?"
<es>

@212
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes. I should have seen him much earlier."
<es>

@216
<en>{Mei}\n"Really... Love is fun, huh?"
<es>

@217
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh...I guess so."
<es>

@218
<en>It sounds like she's never been involved in a relationship...No way! I should be wrong. Ms. Ibuki should be pretty popular among men.
<es>

@222
<en>{Ran}\n"Now get up."
<es>

@224
<en>Ran pulls me up and cleans off the dirt of my back. Ran behaves like a girl - - it is impressive.
<es>

@225
<en>Well, she is a girl. But It is just this Ran is so different from the Ran that I used to know.
<es>

@228
<en>{Ran}\n"Let's go."
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, where are we going?"
<es>

@230
<en>{Ran}\n"It doesn't matter where."
<es>

@231
<en>She looks back at the dorm.
<es>

@234
<en>{Ran}\n"Some place no guardian is around."
<es>

@235
<en>Ran chuckles with a suggestive look. Ms. Ibuki just looks at us with a smile.
<es>

@239
<en>{Mei}\n"Guardian won't be in your way..."
<es>

@240
<en>Ms. Ibuki raises her hand with a smile on her look.
<es>

@243
<en>{Mei}\n"Stay away from dark and dangerous places. Don't get carried away too much. Okay, guys?"
<es>

@247
<en>{Ran}\n"I know, Ms. Ibuki. Let's go, Kazushi"
<es>

@248
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh...Okay...G-Good night, Ms. Ibuki."
<es>

@250
<en>Ran pulls me by the hand. I wave at Ms. Ibuki and she waves at me back.
<es>

@251
<en>I may be wrong, but it appears that Ms. Ibuki casts an envious look at us. I don' know why...
<es>

@256
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I never knew the moonlight is so bright."
<es>

@257
<en>The moonlight is so bright that our shadows are clearly portrayed on the ground.
<es>

@260
<en>{Ran}\n"You are such an urban boy, Kazushi."
<es>

@261
<en>I shrug my shoulders.
<es>

@262
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am not much of an urban boy."
<es>

@263
<en>A question pops out in my mind.
<es>

@264
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where are you from, Ran?"
<es>

@265
<en>I knew she was not from this island, but didn't know exactly where she's from.
<es>

@266
<en>In fact, I don't know much of her.
<es>

@269
<en>{Ran}\n"I was born and grew up in Kanagawa. I'm from a middle-class family. I have live in a single house, which my grandpa built."
<es>

@270
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So you are an urban person yourself. You lived with your grandparents?"
<es>

@271
<en>{Ran}\n"My grandpa died before I was born. So I lived with grandma."
<es>

@272
<en>{Ran}\n"An ordinary family. Not so poor, not so rich."
<es>

@273
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Same as mine. Any siblings?"
<es>

@274
<en>{Ran}\n"No. I am the only child. My parents both worked, so the grandma really took care of me."
<es>

@275
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are a grandma's child, huh?"
<es>

@276
<en>I was a bit surprised to hear her background.
<es>

@279
<en>{Ran}\n"A nice breeze..."
<es>

@280
<en>The breeze must be from the sea. A bit moist wind feels cool and comfortable.
<es>

@281
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It is a little chilly here at night. It gets pretty cold when you are asleep in the room at night. In our dorm, there are so many drafts."
<es>

@282
<en>{Ran}\n"Hahaha. I know. I slept in your room last night. That place is terrible. You should get that place fixed by winter."
<es>

@283
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is it cold in winter here?"
<es>

@286
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes. Pretty cold. Although the sea is warm throughout the year."
<es>

@287
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@288
<en>I sigh deeply, thinking my room will not get warm enough even a heater on then.
<es>

@291
<en>{Ran}\n"I wonder if our school doesn't have much money. I thought alchemy can make people rich."
<es>

@292
<en>Ran looks puzzled as if a little child found out Santa Claus was in fact her Daddy.
<es>

@293
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you studying alchemy to make money?"
<es>

@296
<en>{Ran}\n"Of course! I know it could turn lead and stones into gold. Even if that turns out to be a fraud, I like it because it still sounds like a big dream."
<es>

@297
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah...it's like a big dream."
<es>

@300
<en>{Ran}\n"The school buildings look good, but I don't smell money here."
<es>

@301
<en>Ran sniffs. She certainly has a unique talent, when it comes to money.
<es>

@302
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So this school is not making much money?"
<es>

@305
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't think the school is interested in making money. If they do, they wouldn't allow me to take out all the patents for new goods and products I made through alchemy."
<es>

@306
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Patents? Can't you make money out of that?"
<es>

@309
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah...supplements and things like that. You can certainly make decent money for certain markets."
<es>

@310
<en>It sounds like she is making a lot of money. I thought she was in trouble financially.
<es>

@311
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is that one million yen for, then?"
<es>

@314
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, I was just testing myself."
<es>

@315
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Testing yourself?"
<es>

@316
<en>{Ran}\n"I'd never borrowed money from anyone. And I hate to borrow money. But then, I thought maybe Kazushi would lend me some money."
<es>

@317
<en>{Ran}\n"I wanted to know if Kazushi really lends me money, Because if you don't like me, you don't, right?"
<es>

@318
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So you were testing me too..."
<es>

@321
<en>{Ran}\n"I don't lend even one yen to the person I don't like. I would kill him instead if he asks me for 100.000 yen."
<es>

@322
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey..Hey..."
<es>

@325
<en>{Ran}\n"But Kazushi made me one million yen. And I didn't mind taking that money."
<es>

@326
<en>{Ran}\n"Is this love?"
<es>

@327
<en>That sounds very much like Ran.
<es>

@328
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So you don't need that one million yen? Can you return it to me...?"
<es>

@331
<en>{Ran}\n"No...that is the bonds of our relationship."
<es>

@332
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The bonds? If you give it back to me, I can get the Dad's motorcycle and restore peace in my family..."
<es>

@335
<en>{Ran}\n"No...no...I will keep that money as a memento."
<es>

@336
<en>{Kazushi}\n"As a memento..."
<es>

@337
<en>Yeah...but we are talking about one million yen, not cheap accessories that a young couple buys for each other.
<es>

@338
<en>I guess the only option I have is to make one million with help of alchemy. I wish alchemy was what it is really supposed to be.
<es>

@339
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, by the way, I heard that our school buildings were built by the gold made by alchemy."
<es>

@342
<en>{Ran}\n"Really?!"
<es>

@343
<en>Ran's eyes light up.
<es>

@344
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ms. Ibuki said that...but it is just a rumor."
<es>

@347
<en>{Ran}\n"Ms. Ibuki said that? She might not look it, but Ms. Ibuki is a teacher of alchemy. Maybe it is a true story."
<es>

@348
<en>Ran is thinking very seriously about the rumor.
<es>

@349
<en>{Kazushi}\n"And Ms. Ibuki also said that there used to be the esoteric teachings of that in school."
<es>

@350
<en>{Ran}\n"The esoteric teachings of alchemy? You mean the way to change lead into gold?"
<es>

@351
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. She said making gold might be impossible, but there may be the teachings left out somewhere. Although they may not necessarily talk about how to make gold."
<es>

@354
<en>{Ran}\n"It sounds interesting. I want to know more about it."
<es>

@355
<en>Ran kindles her eyes like the moonlight. What kind of a mischief is she plotting?
<es>

@356
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know anything more about it. Because Ms. Ibuki would not want to talk about this."
<es>

@359
<en>{Ran}\n"She wouldn't? Hmm? That makes me even more fascinated in the story."
<es>

@360
<en>It seems Ran finds it interesting. And she must be up to something mischievous.
<es>

@361
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't even think about something dangerous, though."
<es>

@364
<en>{Ran}\n"I know. Are you worried about me?"
<es>

@367
<en>As Ran loops her hand around my arm, her tits accidentally touch my elbow. This makes my dick hard and big.
<es>

@368
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course, I am worried. Because I am your..."
<es>

@369
<en>I press her against me...but she slips through my arm.
<es>

@371
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@374
<en>{Ran}\n"You want to have sex, don't you?"
<es>

@375
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah...Can I?"
<es>

@376
<en>{Ran}\n"Sorry, no. It still hurts down there. So I will pass today."
<es>

@377
<en>She gives me an apologetic gesture by covering her crotch with her hand.
<es>

@378
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It still hurts, huh? I am sorry too."
<es>

@379
<en>I feel guilty about causing her pain.
<es>

@380
<en>And I feel guilty about insensitively making a pass at her.
<es>

@381
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do for you?"
<es>

@382
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you want me to rub the part that is painful? Maybe not..."
<es>

@385
<en>{Ran}\n"You don't have to worry about it. Boys don't understand this anyway."
<es>

@386
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know but..."
<es>

@389
<en>{Ran}\n"But you know what? This pain actually makes me happy because this is the proof of our bonds."
<es>

@390
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The proof?"
<es>

@391
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes, the proof of our bonds. The pain makes me feel that you are still inside me. So pain is not only a bad thing."
<es>

@392
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@393
<en>Ran nods in approval. I love this girl. She is truly a wonderful girl.
<es>

@394
<en>{Ran}\n"What? What are you looking at?"
<es>

@395
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no..nothing..."
<es>

@396
<en>I'm too embarrassed to say what I thought.
<es>

@397
<en>Ran, then, gives me a suggestive smile.
<es>

@400
<en>{Ran}\n"Do you want me to do a blow job?"
<es>

@401
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@402
<en>I didn't get what she said first.
<es>

@405
<en>{Ran}\n"I know you wanted it so bad, right? So I can do the mouth thing for you."
<es>

@406
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oral sex...?"
<es>

@407
<en>{Ran}\n"The boys will be happy as long as they come, right?"
<es>

@408
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But...are you sure?"
<es>

@409
<en>I am still hesitant. It's a big surprise. She proposes that!
<es>

@412
<en>{Ran}\n"Sure. A girl wants to do anything for her love."
<es>

@413
<en>I know there are a lot of girls out there who hate it. But Ran says she would do it. Maybe I am a lucky son of bitch.
<es>

@414
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay, so please do it."
<es>

@415
<en>I cannot fight back my lust and curiosity.
<es>

@416
<en>What's the next? Should I take my pants off myself or ask her to do it for me?
<es>

@419
<en>{Ran}\n"Let me see..."
<es>

@420
<en>Ran takes my pants. Oh, she is taking them off for me? I am a lucky man!
<es>

@423
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmm? Your wallet? Where is your wallet?"
<es>

@424
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@425
<en>But Ran just takes my wallet out of my pocket and looks inside.
<es>

@428
<en>{Ran}\n"You only have this much?"
<es>

@429
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, what are you doing?"
<es>

@432
<en>{Ran}\n"What am I doing? Of course, I am checking your money."
<es>

@433
<en>Dizziness suddenly hits me.
<es>

@434
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are not taking money for this, are you?"
<es>

@437
<en>{Ran}\n"Of course I am! Why do I have to give you a blow job for nothing?"
<es>

@438
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Because you are my girlfriend?"
<es>

@439
<en>{Ran}\n"Girlfriends don't do that for free, do they?"
<es>

@440
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They do!"
<es>

@441
<en>They do? I guess they do. Wait! They do it because they get paid by their boyfriends for this?
<es>

@444
<en>{Ran}\n"So what are you gonna do? Do it or not?"
<es>

@445
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm.."
<es>

@446
<en>Of course, I do. But doing it in exchange for money doesn't sound right to me.
<es>

@447
<en>If I say okay this time, this may go on for ever.
<es>

@450
<en>{Ran}\n"If you don't want me to do it, that is fine with me. I am already enjoying chatting with you."
<es>

@451
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please do it! I will pay you!!"
<es>

@452
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahh..."
<es>

@455
<en>Shit! I gave in! Ran smiles and takes money out of my wallet. This is not good, definitely not good...
<es>
