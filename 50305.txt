<es>

@8
<en>I came to stop feeling something different in the library entrance today.
<es>

@9
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whew....I'm nervous."
<es>

@10
<en>My mouth got dry, so I wiped it. Then, I remember the kiss we had yesterday.
<es>

@11
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I did kiss with Ms.Mei, didn't I?"
<es>

@12
<en>I can't help grinning. I feel like running around the school yard shouting.
<es>

@13
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What should I do today? How far should I go? Another kiss or one step further?"
<es>

@14
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is after a kiss? I'm not sure what I should do for pet-petting? I don't know how I touch Ms.Mei's body."
<es>

@15
<en>{Door}\n"Excuse me~"
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh!!"
<es>

@17
<en>I was freaked out when the door in front of me talked all of a sudden. I thought this was just a door until yesterday.
<es>

@18
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wha-what is this? Is this door different from yesterday?"
<es>

@19
<en>{Door}\n"It's not that, um...."
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh.......Rin...?"
<es>

@25
<en>{Rin}\n"Hello..."
<es>

@26
<en>It wasn't a door that talked to me, that was Rin. Well, it makes sense.
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't know you were there."
<es>

@28
<en>{Rin}\n"I'm sorry."
<es>

@29
<en>Rin's face is somehow red. If she was right behind this door, it means ....
<es>

@30
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did you hear what I said now?"
<es>

@31
<en>{Rin}\n"Um..."
<es>

@32
<en>Her red face becomes steamy red. I feel dizzy now.
<es>

@33
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Re-really..."
<es>

@34
<en>She heard me. I was talking about petting. I must've sounded pervert.
<es>

@35
<en>{Rin}\n"I don't think it's good idea to talk about petting or something like that in this place...."
<es>

@36
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know I was careless....I shouldn't have done that..."
<es>

@37
<en>{Rin}\n"You're right."
<es>

@38
<en>Rin's face blushes more and more as well as mine. I feel on fire.
<es>

@39
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh....well, Is Ms.Mei here?"
<es>

@40
<en>I couldn't bear the silence, so I just said whatever came up on my mind. I know she is here.
<es>

@43
<en>{Rin}\n"No, she is not here today."
<es>

@44
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wha? She is not here?"
<es>

@45
<en>It was an unexpected answer. She is usually here at this time.
<es>

@46
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She might've overslept."
<es>

@49
<en>{Rin}\n"Do you need Ms. Me-Mei?"
<es>

@50
<en>I wonder why she's stuttering and her face gets redder.
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, it' s kind of business, but not really."
<es>

@52
<en>{Rin}\n"I see...You did cop a....?"
<es>

@53
<en>Looking down, she asked me with an upward glance
<es>

@54
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well...uhh...did you hear that part, too?"
<es>

@55
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh, wow, you really did it!"
<es>

@56
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no! I didn't do that! I haven't that far yet..."
<es>

@57
<en>{Rin}\n"You haven't....huh..., are you going to try that today?"
<es>

@58
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, we just had...um..."
<es>

@59
<en>Oh, I don't know what I'm trying to say. I talk backward and forward....It doesn't go anywhere by talking like this.
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um..I'd better go inside now."
<es>

@61
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh, okay..."
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, can you keep this secret from anybody?"
<es>

@65
<en>{Rin}\n"What? Oh, of course! Then, take care of yourself!"
<es>

@69
<en>Why did she say to take care of myself? Rin rushed out carrying a thick book under her arm.
<es>

@70
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I was completely embarrassed."
<es>

@71
<en>I never expected that she would overhear my secret mumblling.
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But I think I was lucky that was Rin. Because she doesn't seem she likes gossipping. Thank God that was not Sakura."
<es>

@73
<en>She has a big mouth for sure. If she knows this, I bet she would tell the whole world.
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess I should wait inside."
<es>

@80
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, boring..."
<es>

@81
<en>The library without anybody is too quiet to feel relaxed.
<es>

@82
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't see any students here whenever I come here. That's why I dropped my guard."
<es>

@83
<en>I never expected anyboby would be here in this early morning except Ms.Mei because I never saw even one student before.
<es>

@84
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There are so many hardcore books in here. I think there should be more cartoon books, then more students may visit here for sure."
<es>

@85
<en>In this island, you can't even get a cartoon magazine. There is almost no entertainment here.
<es>

@86
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If I look around, I may be able to find something fun."
<es>

@87
<en>I started to walk down looking around the bookrack to kill time.
<es>

@88
<en>As walking down the aisle, I came to stop at the furthest end of the library again.
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh...."
<es>

@90
<en>I see that door in front of me.
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@93
<en>When I heard shrill sound of winds, the door opened a little.
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It is opened."
<es>

@95
<en>The wind blows in from there.
<es>

@96
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, I thought it was locked before."
<es>

@97
<en>Who opened it?
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"..............."
<es>

@99
<en>I hesitated, but only for a split second.
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm going inside and check."
<es>

@107
<en>It isn't very big inside here, but it is dark and cluttered with books and things.
<es>

@108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It smells dust."
<es>

@109
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh?"
<es>

@110
<en>I didn't know Ms.Mei was here until I heard her voice.
<es>

@111
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh? Where are you, Ms.Mei?"
<es>

@112
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm over here."
<es>

@113
<en>She raises her hand over a heap of books. So, I went around to see her, and there she is.
<es>

@118
<en>{Mei}\n"I knew you were coming soon. But how did you know I was here?"
<es>

@119
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, It' is a coincidence. I just found the door was opened. I didn't know you found the key for it."
<es>

@120
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, since I looked for it. Actually, I didn't need to look for it."
<es>

@123
<en>{Mei}\n"It's weird that I haven't seen it earier."
<es>

@124
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Was it that easy to find it?"
<es>

@125
<en>It seems like nobody hid it. It's more like nobody has noticed it.
<es>

@126
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think this place is used as a storage."
<es>

@127
<en>It obviously looks like that. Tons of dust and heap of books romdomly piled up each other.
<es>

@128
<en>{Mei}\n"Yeah, it looks like that. Nothing really looks important."
<es>

@129
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, shoot. I hoped there was some kind of treasure hidden in here."
<es>

@132
<en>I said it seriously, Ms.Mei chuckled.
<es>

@133
<en>{Mei}\n"Boys like to dream some treasure to find, or they like to adventure in the mountain, or make a confidential territory for themselves."
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I did those kinds of stuff when I was child."
<es>

@135
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Besides, this islands is perfect for that adventure for boys...a gold made of alchemy or something like that."
<es>

@136
<en>{Mei}\n"Even if there is a treasure here, they don't hide in this place where anybody can find easily, I think."
<es>

@137
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's true."
<es>

@140
<en>{Mei}\n"But there are many books here look very old and precious, so when it comes to that, you may find some kind of value in these books."
<es>

@141
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you mean these books may get premium?"
<es>

@144
<en>{Mei}\n"It's possible!"
<es>

@145
<en>Ms.Mei said half jokingly, but I've become serious about it. I begin to see those old books piled up ramdomly are treasurable.
<es>

@146
<en>I should check them soon. I need to make money for the date.
<es>

@147
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Dating..."
<es>

@150
<en>{Mei}\n"What?"
<es>

@151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where do the dating couples usually go for a fun in this island?"
<es>

@154
<en>{Mei}\n"Let's see....If you go out to the town, there is a snack bar, which is very popular since they have a Karaoke machine."
<es>

@155
<en>The snack bar has a Karaoke machine....Huh? It's not Karaoke box, is it? No wonder this is still countyside.
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you do Karaoke, Ms.Mei?"
<es>

@159
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, do you want me to sing?"
<es>

@160
<en>Ms.Mei's eyes shined wryly. I felt a chill on my spine. I think she is the type who dosen't give up her turn to another.
<es>

@161
<en>{Mei}\n"Do you want to go with me next time? I'll treat you."
<es>

@162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll think about it."
<es>

@163
<en>She could be a wild with a little bit alcohol. In a way, I want to see her in drunk.
<es>

@164
<en>She didn't seem to have any problem when I said dating. I should ask her next time, and I go further to the next step to kiss all over.....
<es>

@171
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hey, Kazushi. Do you feel good by petting?"
<es>

@174
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Boooohh!!"
<es>

@175
<en>That was dinner time. When Sakura asked me about the next step after a kiss, I shot out the rice out of my mouth.
<es>

@179
<en>{Appo-}\n"What are you doing? It's disgusting..."
<es>

@180
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sa-Sakura, Where did you hear that?"
<es>

@186
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, I heard that you and Mei did a lot of progress today."
<es>

@187
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Do you know that, too, Ran?"
<es>

@188
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hey, Kazushi. What is petting?"
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wha-what?"
<es>

@190
<en>Why does everybody know about it? How....
<es>

@197
<en>{Rin}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@198
<en>I met Rin's eyes, and she looked away quickly. Now, I know who did this.
<es>

@199
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no....."
<es>

@200
<en>{Rin}\n"I'm sorry~!!!"
<es>

@201
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You have such a big mouth! I asked you not to tell anybody!"
<es>

@202
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh, I know....Sorry....!!"
<es>

@203
<en>I didn't know Rin had a big mouth. I trusted Rin.
<es>

@207
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You can't seal girl's mouth. Every girl loves gossiping."
<es>

@208
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess you're right."
<es>

@209
<en>I will never trust girls, except Ms.Mei.
<es>

@217
<en>{Appo-}\n"You seem doing well with Mei, Kazushi."
<es>

@220
<en>{Pierre}\n"I want to hear more detail about it over there."
<es>

@221
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hm...?"
<es>

@223
<en>I was held tight from behind, it was Daigo.
<es>

@226
<en>{Appo-}\n"Okay, take him!"
<es>

@229
<en>{Daigo}\n"If you tell us everything, we let you go soon."
<es>

@230
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I-I don't have anything to tell you because I haven't done anything yet."
<es>

@231
<en>{Pierre}\n"No argument!"
<es>

@232
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hell No....~"
<es>

@241
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kiss in the storm~, how romantic it is!"
<es>

@242
<en>{Ran}\n"I can't believe you ara dating with Mei. It's a crime."
<es>

@243
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why is that?"
<es>

@244
<en>I don't know why, but I was taken to girl's room and questioned. I had to say everything I knew.
<es>

@248
<en>{Pierre}\n"It's pathetic to stop at the stage of kissing in the perfect situation."
<es>

@252
<en>{Appo-}\n"Indeed. When I was at the first time, I was ultra fast, though."
<es>

@256
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Despite of his first time, it was like a storm.....I feel a piecing ache again."
<es>

@263
<en>{Daigo}\n"Don't remember now."
<es>

@266
<en>{Pierre}\n"Don't feel the ache now."
<es>

@270
<en>{Rin}\n"When you recall your memory, you feel piecing ache..."
<es>

@274
<en>{Sakura}\n"Are you fantasizing it now? It's so cute. Where do you have ache now, Rin? Over here?"
<es>

@275
<en>{Rin}\n"No way! I was just joking!"
<es>

@279
<en>{Pierre}\n"Wowwww......It's serious one, not from a video movie..."
<es>

@280
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...................."
<es>

@283
<en>I feel left out.
<es>

@284
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I go now?"
<es>

@289
<en>{Ran}\n"What are you talking about? We haven't started asking you questions yet."
<es>

@290
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I gave you all stories I knew and you looked having fun. So, can I go?"
<es>

@291
<en>{Haruka}\n"We have more questions to ask you. How did you feel when you kissed? Where did you do?"
<es>

@292
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where? Um....Oh, it was at the library. There is another room at the far end. I bet you didn't know it."
<es>

@293
<en>I tried to change the subject. I know eventually I have to say all the way, but I wanted to do a liitle resistance at least to keep my pride.
<es>

@296
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, are you talking about the door which never opens?"
<es>

@297
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, You knew."
<es>

@301
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I knew that, too. I think everyone knows it."
<es>

@305
<en>{Appo-}\n"So do I. I was looking for erotic books and I found it."
<es>

@308
<en>I guess everybody knows about the door. Well, it's not really surprised they already knew it.
<es>

@309
<en>Even that room is at the far end of the library, but if you go there often, it's not difficult to see the door. But, something is not right.
<es>

@310
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That means everybody should know that has a secret room behind it."
<es>

@313
<en>{Haruka}\n"That door is not a secret at all. There is a key for that everyone can get in the library."
<es>

@314
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, really?"
<es>

@315
<en>{Haruka}\n"If you get permission, everybody can go inside it unless you wanna go in the storage room with some reasons."
<es>

@316
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you know that is a storage room,too?"
<es>

@317
<en>It's not surprised that Haruka knew about it because she is a granddaughter of the principal.
<es>

@318
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, still feel weird. Ms.Mei said she didn't know about it, and noticed the door recently."
<es>

@321
<en>{Haruka}\n"Wha? I don't think so. Because I know that since I was a little."
<es>

@325
<en>{Rin}\n"I knew since I came to this school. I used to go to the library a lot because there were large collection of rare books."
<es>

@326
<en>Rin sounds she is a regular to the library. No wonder I bumped into her there today. I got to be carefull from now.
<es>

@327
<en>{Rin}\n"Well, I think I'd better not to go there often."
<es>

@328
<en>She mumbles with her face blushing. I think I bothered her with our stuff.
<es>

@329
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please, don't bother yourself because we are not doing anything bad."
<es>

@332
<en>{Rin}\n"But...... pet...."
<es>

@333
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I never did that kind of thing at the library."
<es>

@337
<en>{Pierre}\n"But, if you walk around the inside of the library, everybody would notice the door. That's why I'm telling you it's strange that Mei didn't know until recently."
<es>

@338
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're right."
<es>

@339
<en>If she is a strudent, I understand. But, she is a director of the library, she should've known in every corner and hole.
<es>

@344
<en>{Haruka}\n"Or, simply, she forgot about it."
<es>

@345
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She forgot...."
<es>

@348
<en>It may have some kind of connection that she doesn't have her memory. It is possible.
<es>

@349
<en>Her memory...of the past was gone....
<es>

@350
<en>So many unkown facts about Ms.Mei.....I felt I wanted to know more about her once again.
<es>

@353
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh, I can tell you're thinking about Mei again..."
<es>

@354
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah...So?"
<es>

@359
<en>{Appo-}\n"Good for you, you didn't hide it this time."
<es>

@360
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't need to because I was just thinking about her past."
<es>

@364
<en>{Ran}\n"Mei's past? Hm...I'm curious about it, too."
<es>

@365
<en>She shines her eyes as she were a paparazzi. I hope she doesn't think it is Ms.Mei's tender point. I have to protect her.
<es>

@369
<en>{Rei}\n"I think Haruka may know Mei's past. Ms.Mei is a graduate from this school, I think."
<es>

@370
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's right."
<es>

@371
<en>Haruka told me she grew up in this island, that means she may know Ms.Mei's school years.....
<es>

@375
<en>{Haruka}\n"But, I don't remember much about when Mei was a student. Well, I should rather say I didn't know her than I don't remember her."
<es>

@379
<en>{Pierre}\n"Well, I don't blame on you. There were so many stuedents anyway."
<es>

@383
<en>{Sakura}\n"Mei must've stood out from the crowd. But, you still don't remember her, huh?"
<es>

@386
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hm...I don't. I only remember a pretty lady a long time ago...."
<es>

@387
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Could it be Ms.Mei?"
<es>

@390
<en>{Haruka}\n"I somehow can't match that laday with Mei. So, it could be somebody else or memory slip."
<es>

@391
<en>It really doesn't clear anything. Ms.Mei's past is totally misty and vague.
<es>

@395
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh, let's take a look at the "school yearbook. We may find out something in there."
<es>

@396
<en>{Kazushi}\n"School yearbook...."
<es>

@397
<en>I see the light with Rin's idea.
<es>

@398
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good idea with school yearbook. I never thought about it."
<es>

@401
<en>There must be Ms.Mei in the yearbook for sure. She got to be in there, otherwise we are at the end of resorses.
<es>

@402
<en>I'm sure it will be a big help to find out Ms.Mei's past.
<es>

@403
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why didn't I come up with that idea? Thanks, Rin! She is always smart."
<es>

@404
<en>Okay, I should tell Ms.Mei about this. If we look into the yearbook, I'm sure we'll find something.
<es>

@410
<en>I open that aged door, and put the light on. The squeaky door was quiet today, probably it became smooth from the few times of open and shut.
<es>

@413
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sure I've seen it somewhere in the back end."

<en>{Kazushi}\n"Over here? Why do you have to keep it in that far end?"
<es>

@417
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, I don't know."
<es>

@418
<en>The school yearbooks are not at a faculty room either at the library. I asked the other teachers and he said they were here.
<es>

@419
<en>That means he knew this place.
<es>

@422
<en>{Mei}\n"I guess everybody knew about this room. Why didn't I notice it before?"
<es>

@423
<en>Ms.Mei looks worried. I think she must be feeling she is left out from the world.
<es>

@424
<en>I hold her hand to encourage her. That's all I could do for her now.
<es>

@427
<en>{Mei}\n"Hm...Thanks...I'll be all right."
<es>

@428
<en>I walk over to the end wall quietly, holding her hand. There are dusy books piled up in heap, which are not in Engilsh but other langages.
<es>

@429
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are they all about alchemy?"
<es>

@432
<en>{Mei}\n"They look like it. I checked these books before and sure they are very valuable."
<es>

@433
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder that's why they were kept in here."
<es>

@434
<en>If you think about it, all of these books look valuable to me now. But, still I don't understand why school yearbooks are kept with them in here.
<es>

@435
<en>I keep walking further down on the aisle feeling sense of discomfort.
<es>

@436
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@437
<en>There is a bookshelf we are looking for. It was easy to find because the spine label of the book said in Japanese.
<es>

@440
<en>{Mei}\n"Here is a yearbook of Eiden school."
<es>

@441
<en>There are dozens of gorgeous yearbooks that are leather-bound version. It does tell you the long history of the school.
<es>

@442
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Which one is it?"
<es>

@445
<en>{Mei}\n"I won't tell you. Well.....this one..."
<es>

@447
<en>Ms.Mei took out one volume out of the bookshelf, then, she turns the pages of books quickly, not showing the year on the front cover.
<es>

@448
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why do you have to hide it?"
<es>

@451
<en>{Mei}\n"I know, but..."
<es>

@452
<en>She is still mid twenty. She doesn't need to worry about her age yet.
<es>

@456
<en>I look into the opened yearbook on the desk. I saw a group picture and her name, Mei Ibuki who was in an school uniform.
<es>

@457
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whoa, you were so adorable then."
<es>

@458
<en>{Mei}\n"I think because of a childish face. I feel embarrassed."
<es>

@459
<en>She has nothing to feel embarrassed about her younger days because she was very cute.
<es>

@460
<en>She has more elegant beauty now, but when she was young, she looked rather an innocent adorable kid.
<es>

@461
<en>How can I explain the degree of completion between now and then? I'm sure her relatives had told her she would be a beautiful woman some day.
<es>

@462
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If there was such a cute girl like her in my class, it's no doubt that I will have a crush on her."
<es>

@463
<en>I still like her. In either way, I was supposed to be fall in love with her.
<es>

@464
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, come on, Kazushi..."
<es>

@465
<en>Ms.Mei turns the pages blushing her cheeks. The pages were all pictures about the scool events, after that the pages became with all writings.
<es>

@467
<en>These are the pages about miscellany column.
<es>

@468
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you remember what you wrote?"
<es>

@469
<en>{Mei}\n"Not at all."
<es>

@470
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course not."
<es>

@471
<en>Of course, she doesn't remember because of her memory loss, but I thought she might remember something.
<es>

@472
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's see what you wrote. Oh, here..."
<es>

@473
<en>I stopped turning the pages.
<es>

@474
<en>3-A Mei Ibuki 'Three year's memory'
<es>

@475
<en>That was the title of her graduation miscellany column.
<es>

@476
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm nervous a little bit."
<es>

@477
<en>There are hand written letters not printed ones. They all look very roundish, like a girlish writing.
<es>

@478
<en>{Mei}\n"I can't believe this is my hand writing."
<es>

@479
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know."
<es>

@480
<en>The letters Ms.Mei writes are thicker, stronger touch as we learned in a penmanship. I can say that because I see her writing on the blackboard all the time.
<es>

@481
<en>The letters she wrote are totally different from now, as somebody else's hand writing, though.
<es>

@482
<en>{Mei}\n"I wonder the memory loss makes the writing style change."
<es>

@483
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It could mean you got matured. I think hand writing will change along with your age."
<es>

@484
<en>{Mei}\n"You may be right."
<es>

@485
<en>Ms.Mei looks very anxious that she can't believe they were her own hand writings.
<es>

@486
<en>I felt a little strange, but it wasn't big concern to me.
<es>

@487
<en>Plus, this is her wrinting for sure.
<es>

@488
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can you read it aloud?"
<es>

@489
<en>{Mei}\n"You read it, Kazushi. I feel nervous doing that."
<es>

@490
<en>I guess she is nervous about knowing her unknown pass. She pushes the book onto me.
<es>

@491
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you ready?"
<es>

@492
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, please."
<es>

@493
<en>Ms.Mei closes her eyes and wait for me starting to read. I feel nervous, too.
<es>

@494
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well... "I have full of precious memories for this three years since I got into this school.""
<es>

@495
<en>I took sigh while I was reading.
<es>

@496
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're so cool, sounds very poetic."
<es>

@497
<en>{Mei}\n"Precious memory....But, she forgot all those precious memories, too."
<es>

@498
<en>Ms.Mei smiles bitterly. She looks sad a little feeling loss of real precious stuff.
<es>

@499
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I continue, okay? Let's find out more."
<es>

@500
<en>{Mei}\n"Yeah...."
<es>

@501
<en>She waits for the next nervously even though that was her own thing.
<es>

@502
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I got homesick for a while after I entered in this school. But, Miyoko, her full name is Miyoko Takemura, comforted me a lot when I felt down."
<es>

@503
<en>She is a roommate in the dorm for three years.
<es>

@504
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miyoko was really good to me for that three years. And we promised to keep our friendship even we married and have own family."
<es>

@505
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miyoko...."
<es>

@506
<en>I wanted to make sure she still remembered. Ms.Mei shook her head quietly. I knew she didn't remember.
<es>

@512
<en>{Mei}\n"I sound very hearltess, don't I?"
<es>

@513
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't blame yourself. You'll remember someday soon."
<es>

@516
<en>{Mei}\n"I hope so."
<es>

@517
<en>The events at school....she wrote the memory when she felt happy then, but she has no recollection, but....
<es>

@520
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't feel this is about me."
<es>

@521
<en>She smiles at a loss. And I smiled her back at least because I felt the same way she did.
<es>

@522
<en>Ms.Mei in this writing seems completely different person that I know. I have a hard time to build her image then from now.
<es>

@524
<en>Ms.Mei in the writing was energetic, scatter brain and very childish, but now, she is very elegant and mature lady.
<es>

@526
<en>I sometimes see the cartoon story that a bad person who lost his memory changed into a good one, which reminds me of the case of Ms.Mei.
<es>

@527
<en>I feel this is not just the matter of her matureness along with time, rather feel some kind of change from the base who she is.
<es>

@528
<en>{Mei}\n"I wonder this one in the writing is real me."
<es>

@529
<en>She mumbles uncertainly. I don't blame her. So, I didn't say anything to her.
<es>

@532
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't want to brag myself, but I think she was sweet girl in this writing, don't you think so? Everybody seems to love her."
<es>

@533
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Everybody loves you even now, Ms.Mei."
<es>

@534
<en>I said it, feeling a little offended by the denial of her present sweetness.
<es>

@535
<en>Of course, she didn't mean it because both of them are Ms.Mei.
<es>

@538
<en>{Mei}\n"But if that one is real me, do you regret that you fell in love with me?"
<es>

@539
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think so."
<es>

@540
<en>I said so, but I don't know what else I can say after that. "I don't think so."is simple to say, but that was true statement, though.
<es>

@541
<en>How would I reget?
<es>

@542
<en>I know it's not that simple to understand what I feel.
<es>

@543
<en>When her memory is back, is she going to be adorable, sweet character like before?
<es>

@544
<en>If that happens, I wonder my feeling toward her would change or not.
<es>

@545
<en>I don't know, well....I know.
<es>

@546
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I would like you no matter what."
<es>

@547
<en>I believe that for sure.
<es>

@550
<en>{Mei}\n"But, if you compare me in the picture and me here, they look like same in the appearance, but there is the total difference in the character."
<es>

@551
<en>{Mei}\n"Did you fall in love with my appearance?"
<es>

@552
<en>If they are same in appearance, the inside doesn't matter, does it? I think it's a nonsense qestion because they both are the same person.
<es>

@553
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't mean it. It's ridiculous judging you only by the appearance."
<es>

@554
<en>What am I supposed to do, if that one is real Ms.Mei's character, not one that I know.
<es>

@555
<en>Oh, it's confusing.
<es>

@558
<en>{Mei}\n"You like who I am now, right? Maybe, I'd better stay like this without memory back."
<es>

@559
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ms.Mei..."
<es>

@560
<en>That's wrong. But, if I say positive for her question, I may hurt her feeling, too.
<es>

@561
<en>I like who she is, that's why I don't want her to get her memory back. I wish she could be the same person I know. I think that is what Ms.Mei wants to hear.
<es>

@562
<en>Even she gets her memory back, it doesn't mean she would disappear, right? Nobody knows what's gonna happen until she remembers her past.
<es>

@563
<en>What should I say to Ms. Mei? And which is my real feeling toward her?
<es>

@564
<en>What if Ms.Mei gets her memory back some day, and she becomes a totally different person.....
<es>

@565
<en>Why did I fall in love with her? Is Ms.Mei that I like a real her or....?
<es>

@567
<en>{Kazushi}\n".............."
<es>

@568
<en>{Mei}\n"Um..I'm sorry. I know I get you into trouble."
<es>

@569
<en>She had to say something because, I think, she worried about me who lost for a word.
<es>

@570
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, not at all....Sorry I lost my words....but now, I can guarantee it for you."
<es>

@572
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I like you the most in the world. I like you a lot, Ms.Mei."
<es>

@573
<en>That's all I could say. I just let out my true feeling without reasons.
<es>

@576
<en>{Mei}\n"Thank you...."
<es>

@577
<en>She clenched her hands in fron of her breasts feeling deeply with what I said. My heart was filled with her praying gesture.
<es>

@578
<en>They say love is a religion, and I tell you that Ms.Mei is a goddess to me.
<es>

@581
<en>{Mei}\n"Are you regretting that you're in love with a woman whose background is complicated?"
<es>

@582
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please, don't say that. I don't want to hear that again."
<es>

@585
<en>{Mei}\n"Huh...sorry."
<es>

@586
<en>When she said sorry, she sounded happy a llittle bit. I don't want her to worry about us any more. I know she already went through a lot with no memory.
<es>

@587
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I promised you, remember?"
<es>

@588
<en>I muttered looking at the pinkie that I promised I won't giver her any worrisome or anxiety any more.
<es>

@589
<en>What else can I do to ease her tension?
<es>

@590
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ms.Mei..."
<es>

@591
<en>I don't know what I can do for her, but I really want to do something for her right now. So, I hugged her tight.
<es>

@594
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, Kazushi!?"
<es>

@595
<en>Despite Ms.Mei is puzzled. I pull in her body for embracing with a little force.
<es>

@596
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can protect you."
<es>

@597
<en>I feel miserable that's all I could say. But, I want to protect her with all my strength from all the worrisome incident.
<es>

@600
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi...."
<es>

@601
<en>Ms.Mei lifted her head. Her shiny lips look trembling.
<es>

@602
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ms.Mei..."
<es>

@604
<en>And here is the second kiss.....This time, I kiss her a little deeper.
<es>

@605
<en>{Mei}\n"mmm, ugh, mm"
<es>

@606

<es>

@607

<es>

@611
<en>{Mei}\n"uh...uuhh..."
<es>

@612
<en>The sweet moan of Ms.Mei. I want to hear that more. I want to be with her longer.
<es>

@613

<es>

@614
<en>{Mei}\n"Um...What do you think of doing it now?"
<es>

@615
<en>Ms.Mei muttered in my chest.
<es>

@616
<en>{Mei}\n"Holding each other and kiss....That was before. And today is...."
<es>

@617
<en>When Ms.Mei liftes her head, I see her big eyes shining with full of fears and anticipations.
<es>

@618
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Today is...."
<es>

@619
<en>Don't be scared. I tell myself.
