<es>

@8
<en>It was the same door to the library as always, but today it seemed completely different as I stood before it.
<es>

@9
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whew, I'm nervous."
<es>

@10
<en>My mouth felt dry, so I wiped my lips. That made me recall our kiss yesterday.
<es>

@11
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I did kiss Mei-sensei, didn't I?"
<es>

@12
<en>I couldn't help but grin. I felt like running around the academy shouting.
<es>

@13
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wh-what should I do today? How far should I go? Another kiss or one step further?"
<es>

@14
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What comes after a kiss? Okay, to be frank what is p-p-petting?! What do I do to what on sensei?"
<es>

@15
<en>{Door}\n"Excuse me~"
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh!!"
<es>

@17
<en>I was freaked out when the door in front of me talked all of a sudden. I thought this was just a door until yesterday.
<es>

@18
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wh-what is this? Is this door different from yesterday?"
<es>

@19
<en>{Door}\n"It's not that, um..."
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh...... Fujisaki-san...?"
<es>

@25
<en>{Rin}\n"Hello..."
<es>

@26
<en>It wasn't the door that talked to me, it was Fujisaki-san.\nWell, that makes sense.
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't know you were there."
<es>

@28
<en>{Rin}\n"I'm sorry."
<es>

@29
<en>Fujisaki-san's was blushing for some reason. If she was right behind the door, then...
<es>

@30
<en>{Kazushi}\n"D-did you hear what I just said?"
<es>

@31
<en>{Rin}\n"Hauu..."
<es>

@32
<en>Her bright red face nearly issued steam. My eyes spun.
<es>

@33
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I-I see..."
<es>

@34
<en>She heard me, huh? I was talking to myself about petting. I'm such a pervert.
<es>

@35
<en>{Rin}\n"I-I don't think this is the place to talk about p-pet...*mumble*... and such to yourself..."
<es>

@36
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Y-yeah... That was thoughtless... I'm already regretting it..."
<es>

@37
<en>{Rin}\n"That's for the best."
<es>

@38
<en>Fujisaki-san blushed even more. I'm sure I was just as bad. My cheeks were on fire.
<es>

@39
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, uhh... by the way, is sensei in there?"
<es>

@40
<en>I couldn't bear the silence so I asked a random question. I'm sure she was there, but...
<es>

@43
<en>{Rin}\n"No, she's not there today it seems."
<es>

@44
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? She's not?"
<es>

@45
<en>That answer was unexpected. Usually she's here by now.
<es>

@46
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did she oversleep?"
<es>

@49
<en>{Rin}\n"D-do you need sensei?"
<es>

@50
<en>Why did she stutter? Why was she blushing even more?
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I kind of do, I kind of don't..."
<es>

@52
<en>{Rin}\n"I see... Have you done any pe......with sensei?"
<es>

@53
<en>She turned her blushing face down and glanced up at me with her big eyes as she asked.
<es>

@54
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, y-you heard that part too...?"
<es>

@55
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh, you really did... it... wow..."
<es>

@56
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, we haven't, we haven't! We haven't done that! Not yet..."
<es>

@57
<en>{Rin}\n"Not yet... huh... then, were you today? Not long from now?"
<es>

@58
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, uhh, umm..."
<es>

@59
<en>I'm done. I can't think straight. And nothing good will come from saying anymore.
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm, I'm going to go wait inside now..."
<es>

@61
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh, okay..."
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm...... can you keep this a secret from everyone else?"
<es>

@65
<en>{Rin}\n"Huh? Y-yes, of course! T-take care, then!"
<es>

@69
<en>Why did she say take care? Fujisaki-san dashed off, carrying a thick literature book in her arms.
<es>

@70
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Close call."
<es>

@71
<en>I never expected Fujisaki-san would catch me saying such embarrassing things.
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thank goodness it was Fujisaki-san. I don't think she'll go blabbing this around, though Sakura would've."
<es>

@73
<en>Sakura certainly had loose lips. If she found out, the whole school would know in no time.
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess I should wait inside."
<es>

@80
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So bored."
<es>

@81
<en>The library was too quiet for me to relax.
<es>

@82
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There really isn't ever anyone here. That's probably why I dropped my guard."
<es>

@83
<en>I never expected anyone other than sensei to be here this early - I'd never met anyone on the way here before.
<es>

@84
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There's nothing but difficult books here. If they got some manga, more people would come."
<es>

@85
<en>For one thing it's hard to even get a weekly manga magazine on this island. There's so little entertainment here.
<es>

@86
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder if I'll find anything by looking around?"
<es>

@87
<en>I started to walk around, looking through the shelves to kill time.
<es>

@88
<en>As I walked down the aisle, I came to stop at the furthest end of the library again.
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@90
<en>I saw that door in front of me again.
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh...?"
<es>

@93
<en>I heard the shrill sound of the wind, or so I thought, when the door creaked open.
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's open..."
<es>

@95
<en>Wind blew out from there.
<es>

@96
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But I thought it was locked before?"
<es>

@97
<en>Who opened it?
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"..............."
<es>

@99
<en>I hesitated, but only for a split second.
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm going in."
<es>

@107
<en>It wasn't very big inside. It was just dark, cluttered, and remarkably hard to see.
<es>

@108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It smells like dust."
<es>

@109
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh?"
<es>

@110
<en>I didn't know Mei-sensei was there until I heard her voice.
<es>

@111
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Mei-sensei? Where are you?"
<es>

@112
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm over here."
<es>

@113
<en>She raised her hand over a mound of books. I went around the stack, and there she was.
<es>

@118
<en>{Mei}\n"I figured you'd be coming soon. But how did you know I was in here?"
<es>

@119
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, it was coincidence; I just happened to see that the door was open. Did you find the key to this door?"
<es>

@120
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, I found it quickly once I looked for it. I hardly had to search at all."
<es>

@123
<en>{Mei}\n"It made me wonder why I'd never noticed it before."
<es>

@124
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Was it that easy to find it?"
<es>

@125
<en>It didn't seem like somebody tried to hide it, more like nobody ever noticed it.
<es>

@126
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then this place is just used for storage?"
<es>

@127
<en>From what I could tell, it was. Dust was piled up everywhere and the books were unorganized and stacked haphazardly.
<es>

@128
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes. There doesn't seem to be anything worth looking at in here."
<es>

@129
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, that's a let-down. If only there was treasure or something."
<es>

@132
<en>I said it seriously and sensei chuckled.
<es>

@133
<en>{Mei}\n"Treasure? You really do think just a like a boy. Do you boys go exploring mountains and building secret bases too?"
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, when we were kids."
<es>

@135
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Besides, doesn't this academy just scream that it's hiding something? Like gold created through alchemy or something."
<es>

@136
<en>{Mei}\n"Even if there were such a treasure, they wouldn't hide in a place anyone could find like this."
<es>

@137
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's true."
<es>

@140
<en>{Mei}\n"But there are some very old tomes amongst the books in here, so in that sense there may be a treasure hidden in here."
<es>

@141
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You mean there might be a book that can fetch a premium?"
<es>

@144
<en>{Mei}\n"It's possible!"
<es>

@145
<en>Sensei was only joking, but I was getting serious about it. The haphazard stacks of books started looking like treasure in my eyes.
<es>

@146
<en>I should check them soon. I could use the money for a date.
<es>

@147
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A date, huh..."
<es>

@150
<en>{Mei}\n"What?"
<es>

@151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where do couples usually go to enjoy themselves on this island?"
<es>

@154
<en>{Mei}\n"Let's see... If you go down to the town, there's a snack bar, which is very popular since they have a karaoke machine."
<es>

@155
<en>The snack bar has a karaoke machine... It doesn't have karaoke boxes? We really are in the countryside.
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you do karaoke, Mei-sensei?"
<es>

@159
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, are you trying to make me sing?"
<es>

@160
<en>Sensei's eyes shone with a suspicious glow. I felt a shiver run down my spine. I predict she's the type who never lets go of the mic once it's in her hands.
<es>

@161
<en>{Mei}\n"Would you like to go next time? It'll be my treat."
<es>

@162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll think about it..."
<es>

@163
<en>Considering they also served alcohol there, it set off a red flag in my mind. Then again, I wouldn't mind seeing her get drunk and go wild...
<es>

@164
<en>But she didn't reject the idea of going on a date, did she? I should ask her out next time. Then we'll go past kissing to petting and...
<es>

@171
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hey, Harucchi, does petting feel good?"
<es>

@174
<en>{Kazushi}\n"PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTT!!!"
<es>

@175
<en>It happened at dinner that night. Sakura asked me that out of nowhere and my rice with egg on top went spraying out of my mouth.
<es>

@179
<en>{Appo}\n"Wh-what are you doing, that's disgusting!!"
<es>

@180
<en>{Kazushi}\n"S-Sakura-san, where did you..."
<es>

@186
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, I heard you and Mei-chan got busy today?"
<es>

@187
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Ran, you too?"
<es>

@188
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hey, Kazushi-kun? What's petting?"
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wha-wha...?!"
<es>

@190
<en>Why does everybody know? How did...
<es>

@197
<en>{Rin}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@198
<en>Fujisaki-san's eyes met mine and she quickly averted her gaze. Then it hit me.
<es>

@199
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Aaah!! Y-you didn't..."
<es>

@200
<en>{Rin}\n"I'm sorry~!!!"
<es>

@201
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You damn gossip!! I thought I told you to keep that a secret from everyone!"
<es>

@202
<en>{Rin}\n"Hhhhhhhn!! I'm so sorry~!!"
<es>

@203
<en>I never thought Fujisaki-san had a big mouth. I thought I could trust her.
<es>

@207
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You can't seal a girl's mouth. Gossip is in our DNA."
<es>

@208
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It would seem you're right."
<es>

@209
<en>I won't ever trust a girl again. Other than Mei-sensei.
<es>

@217
<en>{Appo}\n"Sounds like Kazushi and Mei-chan are making progress."
<es>

@220
<en>{Pierre}\n"Well, I want to hear the juicy details about just how much progress."
<es>

@221
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Urk...?"
<es>

@223
<en>Daigo gripped me from behind in a tight full-nelson.
<es>

@226
<en>{Appo}\n"Take him away, boys!"
<es>

@229
<en>{Daigo}\n"Just tell us what you know, and we can let you go."
<es>

@230
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I-I don't know anything! I haven't done anything!!"
<es>

@231
<en>{Pierre}\n"C'mon, fess up!"
<es>

@232
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hhhhhhiiiii!!!"
<es>

@241
<en>{Haruka}\n"A kiss in the storm... That's so romantic!"
<es>

@242
<en>{Ran}\n"You really are dating Mei-chan, aren't you? This is a crime."
<es>

@243
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why?"
<es>

@244
<en>I was carried off to the girls' dorm for some reason and interrogated. They forced me to confess everything.
<es>

@248
<en>{Pierre}\n"Still, what kind of man are you, stopping at a kiss in such a juicy situation?"
<es>

@252
<en>{Appo}\n"Honestly! On my first time, I hit it like the fist of an angry god!"
<es>

@256
<en>{Fuusen}\n"It was his first time, but he was so rough...... Just remembering it makes me ache!"
<es>

@263
<en>{Daigo}\n"Don't remember it now..."
<es>

@266
<en>{Pierre}\n"Don't ache."
<es>

@270
<en>{Rin}\n"You start to ache just from remembering it..."
<es>

@274
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh Rin, look at you imaging it. You're so cute. Where are you aching, Rin? Right here?"
<es>

@275
<en>{Rin}\n"Kyah! I wasn't... Aaahn!"
<es>

@279
<en>{Pierre}\n"Whoooo! This isn't just a porno! It's a real live show!"
<es>

@280
<en>{Kazushi}\n"....................."
<es>

@283
<en>I was left out.
<es>

@284
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I go now?"
<es>

@289
<en>{Ran}\n"What are you talking about? We haven't started asking you questions yet."
<es>

@290
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I've given you enough stories, haven't I? They're having fun too, so can I go?"
<es>

@291
<en>{Haruka}\n"We still have lots of things to ask you. Hey, what does a kiss taste like? Where did you do it?"
<es>

@292
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where? ......Oh, yeah, in the back of the library there's another room. Bet you didn't know?"
<es>

@293
<en>I tried to change the subject. I know I'll eventually have to spill it, but I couldn't just say it. I had to fight back a little to keep my pride.
<es>

@296
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, are you talking about the door which never opens?"
<es>

@297
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? You knew?"
<es>

@301
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I knew about that too. I think everyone knows."
<es>

@305
<en>{Appo}\n"I know about it too. Found it while looking for porn."
<es>

@308
<en>It seemed everyone knew about it. Well, I guess it's not that surprising.
<es>

@309
<en>Even if it is in the far back, anyone coming in and out of the library some would eventually notice it. But wait, isn't that odd?
<es>

@310
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So then everyone knew that there was a door that didn't open?"
<es>

@313
<en>{Haruka}\n"That door opens. The key's in the library."
<es>

@314
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, really?"
<es>

@315
<en>{Haruka}\n"Anyone can use it as long as they have permission. It's just a storage room though, so no one ever wants to."
<es>

@316
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You knew it was a storage room, too?"
<es>

@317
<en>Well, Haruka's the principal's granddaughter, so it makes sense she'd know.
<es>

@318
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But that's odd. Mei-sensei said she didn't know about it. She just recently noticed a door there."
<es>

@321
<en>{Haruka}\n"Huh? No way. I've known about it since I was little."
<es>

@325
<en>{Rin}\n"I noticed it shortly after entering the academy. I used to go to the library all the time because there are a lot of rare books there."
<es>

@326
<en>Fujisaki-san sounded like she was a regular to the library. No wonder I bumped into her there today. I'd have to be careful from now.
<es>

@327
<en>{Rin}\n"But I think I shouldn't go there too often anymore..."
<es>

@328
<en>She muttered, blushing. I think she was trying to be considerate of us.
<es>

@329
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We're not doing anything bad in there, so don't worry about it."
<es>

@332
<en>{Rin}\n"But pe...ng..."
<es>

@333
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We would never do such a thing in the library."
<es>

@337
<en>{Pierre}\n"But you know, anyone who just walks around the library can notice that door pretty easily. How could Mei-chan not know about it?"
<es>

@338
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right?"
<es>

@339
<en>If she was a student, it'd be one thing, but sensei was in charge of the library. Shouldn't she know every corner of it?
<es>

@344
<en>{Haruka}\n"Maybe she just forgot?"
<es>

@345
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Forgot..."
<es>

@348
<en>It may have some kind of connection to her amnesia. Maybe that's the case?
<es>

@349
<en>Sensei's memories, her forgotten past...
<es>

@350
<en>There were too many things I didn't know about sensei. Once again, I felt I wanted to know more about her.
<es>

@353
<en>{Sakura}\n"Ah! You're thinking about Mei-chan again, aren't you?"
<es>

@354
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah... So?"
<es>

@359
<en>{Appo}\n"Oh, nice guts. You didn't hide it this time."
<es>

@360
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not like it was about anything sexy. I was wondering about what sensei was like in the past."
<es>

@364
<en>{Ran}\n"The old Mei-chan, huh? I'm kind of curious too."
<es>

@365
<en>Her eyes shone like a reporter for a gossip mag. She wouldn't try to blackmail her, would she? I have to protect her!
<es>

@369
<en>{Andou}\n"Wouldn't Haruka-chan know about her past? Mei-sensei is an alumnus of this academy, right?"
<es>

@370
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, you're right."
<es>

@371
<en>Haruka told me she grew up on this island. That means she may know about Mei-sensei when she was a student......
<es>

@375
<en>{Haruka}\n"Well, I don't remember anything about Mei-chan as a student. It's more like I never knew than like the memory's gone."
<es>

@379
<en>{Pierre}\n"Well, I don't blame you. There were so many students anyway."
<es>

@383
<en>{Sakura}\n"But someone as pretty as Mei-chan must've stood out. You don't remember anything?"
<es>

@386
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hmm, I don't think so. I do remember there was a pretty lady here several years ago, but..."
<es>

@387
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Was that Mei-sensei?"
<es>

@390
<en>{Haruka}\n"But that memory doesn't match up with Mei-chan. So it's either somebody else, or a mistaken memory..."
<es>

@391
<en>That didn't really clear up anything. Why is everything about Mei-sensei's past so shrouded in mystery?
<es>

@395
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh, right. The graduation album. Maybe we'll find something if we take a look at it?"
<es>

@396
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The graduation album?"
<es>

@397
<en>Fujisaki-san's casual suggestion caused me to see the light.
<es>

@398
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right, her graduation album. I never even thought of that."
<es>

@401
<en>Sensei has to be in her graduation album. Otherwise, we're out of options. She has to be there.
<es>

@402
<en>I'm sure it'll be a great help in learning about sensei's past.
<es>

@403
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why didn't I think of that? Thanks, Fujisaki-san! You're really smart!"
<es>

@404
<en>Alright, I need to tell sensei right away. If we look in her graduation album, I'm sure we'll find some kind of hint.
<es>

@410
<en>I opened the old door and turned on the lights. I guess it worked out its kinks from being opened and closed yesterday, but the terribly squeaky hinge didn't make a sound.
<es>

@413
<en>{Mei}\n"I think I saw it somewhere in the back."
<es>

@414
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Over here? Why do you have to keep it in that far end?"
<es>

@417
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, I wonder why too."
<es>

@418
<en>The graduation albums weren't kept in the faculty room or in the library. I asked the other teachers, and they said they were here.
<es>

@419
<en>Those teachers knew about this place too.
<es>

@422
<en>{Mei}\n"I guess everybody knew about this room. Why was I the only one who didn't notice it before?"
<es>

@423
<en>Sensei looked worried. She probably felt like she was being left out of our world.
<es>

@424
<en>I held her hand to encourage her. That's all I could do for her now.
<es>

@427
<en>{Mei}\n"Hee-hee, thank you. But I'll be alright."
<es>

@428
<en>I quietly headed towards the back with sensei's hand in mine as she smiled. Most of the books stacked and covered in dust where in some language I couldn't read other than English.
<es>

@429
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are all these books about alchemy?"
<es>

@432
<en>{Mei}\n"They look like it. If you look closely, a lot of them are very valuable books."
<es>

@433
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder if that's why they were kept in here."
<es>

@434
<en>Thinking about it, every book did look pretty valuable. But it also felt unnatural for her graduation album to be shut away in here with books like those.
<es>

@435
<en>I continued further down, feeling a sense of angst.
<es>

@436
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@437
<en>We found the shelf we were looking for. I was easy to find because Japanese was written on the spine.
<es>

@440
<en>{Mei}\n"Here it is. Eiden Academy's Graduation Albums."
<es>

@441
<en>There were dozens of gorgeous leather-bound albums lined on the shelf. You could feel the history behind this academy from them.
<es>

@442
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Which one is it?"
<es>

@445
<en>{Mei}\n"I won't tell you. Umm...... This one..."
<es>

@447
<en>Sensei took down an album. She quickly opened it up to hide the year on the cover from me.
<es>

@448
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't have to hide it."
<es>

@451
<en>{Mei}\n"I know that, but..."
<es>

@452
<en>She was still in her mid-twenties. It was nothing for her to worry about yet.
<es>

@456
<en>I looked at the album spread open on the desk. It was a group picture of the class, and there was Ibuki Mei's name and a picture of her in her school uniform.
<es>

@457
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, you were so adorable then."
<es>

@458
<en>{Mei}\n"That's just because I was childish. This is embarrassing."
<es>

@459
<en>She had nothing to feel embarrassed about. She was very cute back in her school days.
<es>

@460
<en>She was more of an elegant beauty now, but back then, sensei looked young and innocent, just what you'd call 'cute'.
<es>

@461
<en>How do I say it? The level of completion was different? She looked like her uncles would've told her "Mei-chan, you'll be a real beauty in a few more years."
<es>

@462
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If there was a girl like this in my class, I'd definitely fall for her."
<es>

@463
<en>I still did. It just meant either way I would've been head over heels for sensei.
<es>

@464
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, come on, Kazushi-kun..."
<es>

@465
<en>Sensei flipped the pages with blushing cheeks. Pictures of school events went on for a while, and after that were pages of text.
<es>

@467
<en>It was the anthology section.
<es>

@468
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you remember what you wrote?"
<es>

@469
<en>{Mei}\n"Not at all."
<es>

@470
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course not."
<es>

@471
<en>How could she remember with amnesia? But I still thought there might be a chance.
<es>

@472
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's see what you wrote. Oh, here..."
<es>

@473
<en>I stopped turning the pages.
<es>

@474
<en>3-A Ibuki Mei "Memories of my Three Years"
<es>

@475
<en>That was the title of her graduation column.
<es>

@476
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm kind of nervous."
<es>

@477
<en>It was handwritten, not typed. The edges were all rounded, just like you'd expect from girls' handwriting.
<es>

@478
<en>{Mei}\n"It doesn't seem like my own handwriting."
<es>

@479
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know."
<es>

@480
<en>Sensei's handwriting that I knew was the steady letters that we all learned in penmanship. I knew because I always saw them written on our chalkboard.
<es>

@481
<en>The letters she wrote now were like someone else's writing compared to the letters in the column.
<es>

@482
<en>{Mei}\n"I wonder if I lost my writing habits along with my memories?"
<es>

@483
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Doesn't it just mean you've matured? Handwriting changes as you get older, doesn't it?"
<es>

@484
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes... you may be right."
<es>

@485
<en>Mei-sensei looked anxious as she looked at the letters which didn't seem like her own.
<es>

@486
<en>I did feel something was a little off, but it probably wasn't anything to worry about.
<es>

@487
<en>There's no mistaking this is what she wrote anyways.
<es>

@488
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei, read it aloud please."
<es>

@489
<en>{Mei}\n"You read it, Kazushi-kun. I feel nervous doing that."
<es>

@490
<en>I guess she was nervous about knowing her past. She shoved the column over to me.
<es>

@491
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you ready?"
<es>

@492
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, please."
<es>

@493
<en>Sensei closed her eyes and waited for me starting to read. I started feeling nervous too.
<es>

@494
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm... "The three years that have passed since I entered Eiden Academy have all been treasured memories to me.""
<es>

@495
<en>I let out a sigh as I read.
<es>

@496
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, sensei. You're words are so poetic."
<es>

@497
<en>{Mei}\n"Treasured memories... huh. And I've even forgotten those treasures too."
<es>

@498
<en>Sensei smiled bitterly. She looked a little sad, as if she truly had just lost something precious to her.
<es>

@499
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll read on, okay? You probably wrote down what happened."
<es>

@500
<en>{Mei}\n"Yeah..."
<es>

@501
<en>She waited anxiously, even though they were her own memories.
<es>

@502
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right when I entered this academy, I got homesick. When I was longing for home, my roommate Miyocchi, Takemura Miyoko-san, really cheered me up."
<es>

@503
<en>It seems that was her roommate for those three years.
<es>

@504
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miyocchi really helped me though these three years. We vowed that we would always stay friends, even after we got married one day."
<es>

@505
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miyocchi..."
<es>

@506
<en>I asked her to be sure. Sensei quietly shook her head. I guess she didn't remember.
<es>

@512
<en>{Mei}\n"I sound heartless, don't I?"
<es>

@513
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't blame yourself like that. You'll remember someday soon."
<es>

@516
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, you're right. I hope so."
<es>

@517
<en>She wrong about memorable events at the academy and what she felt then, but she didn't remember any of it. No, it was more than not remembering...
<es>

@520
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't feel like this is about me."
<es>

@521
<en>She smiled at a loss. I could only smile back at her, because I felt the same way she did.
<es>

@522
<en>The sensei written here left a totally different impression than the one before me. She was like somebody else, and they didn't match.
<es>

@524
<en>The sensei written here gave the impression of a childish, carefree girl whose best point was her energetic attitude. She was completely different from the calm, mature sensei here now.
<es>

@526
<en>You often see stories about a villain losing his memory and becoming a good person in manga, but that's pretty much how it felt.
<es>

@527
<en>It felt like something more fundamental was different, not like something had changed with the passage of time. Perhaps it was due to her amnesia?
<es>

@528
<en>{Mei}\n"I wonder if the girl who wrote this is the real me."
<es>

@529
<en>She mumbled without confidence. I didn't blame her for thinking that. I couldn't give her any reply.
<es>

@532
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't want to brag about myself, but I think the girl who wrote this was very sweet, don't you think? Everybody seemed to love her and care for her."
<es>

@533
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Everybody loves you now, sensei."
<es>

@534
<en>I spoke out, upset at the way it sounded like she was denying who she had become.
<es>

@535
<en>Of course I knew sensei didn't mean it that way. Both of them were sensei.
<es>

@538
<en>{Mei}\n"But if that one is real me, will you regret that you fell in love with the current me?"
<es>

@539
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I won't."
<es>

@540
<en>I started, but couldn't continue. It was easy to say "No, I won't". It was easy, and it wasn't a lie.
<es>

@541
<en>How could I regret it?
<es>

@542
<en>But I didn't think she would except that simple answer to this problem.
<es>

@543
<en>If her memories do come back, will she return to being that adorable, sweet girl depicted in the column?
<es>

@544
<en>If sensei changes like that, will my feelings toward her change as well?
<es>

@545
<en>I don't know. Well... I do know.
<es>

@546
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I would love you no matter what, sensei."
<es>

@547
<en>I believe that for sure.
<es>

@550
<en>{Mei}\n"But the me I am now and the me here are like completely different people. They just look the same."
<es>

@551
<en>{Mei}\n"Did you fall in love with my appearance?"
<es>

@552
<en>If the appearance is the same, does what's inside matter? That question was nonsense. They're both the same - they're sensei.
<es>

@553
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't mean it that way. How could I just be in love with your appearance?"
<es>

@554
<en>But then, what if sensei takes on a difference personality, and that other one is her true self, then what?
<es>

@555
<en>Aghh, this is making my head hurt.
<es>

@558
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi-kun, you love who I am now, right? Then maybe it's better if I don't get my memories back."
<es>

@559
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei..."
<es>

@560
<en>"That's not true." - No, would saying that just hurt sensei?
<es>

@561
<en>"I love you now, so it's better if your memories don't come back. I want things to stay as they are." - would it be best to say that?
<es>

@562
<en>But even if her memories do come back, that doesn't mean this sensei will disappear, right? Not that we'll know until they do come back...
<es>

@563
<en>What should I say to sensei? What are my true feelings in the first place?
<es>

@564
<en>What if one day sensei suddenly gets her memories back, and sensei becomes a different person?
<es>

@565
<en>Why did I fall in love with Sensei? Is the Sensei I fell in love with the real Sensei? Or...?
<es>

@567
<en>{Kazushi}\n"..............."
<es>

@568
<en>{Mei}\n"Umm, I'm sorry. I'm causing you trouble, aren't I?"
<es>

@569
<en>Sensei said something to be considerate after I fell silent, unable to answer.
<es>

@570
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, not at all... I'm sorry I can't say it very well... ...but there is one thing I can say."
<es>

@572
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I love you more than anyone else in the world. I love you, sensei."
<es>

@573
<en>I don't get these difficult matters. I just love sensei. It's not reason, it's overflowing emotion.
<es>

@576
<en>{Mei}\n"Thank you..."
<es>

@577
<en>She clenched her hands in front of her breasts. My heart was touched by the way she seemed as if she were praying.
<es>

@578
<en>They say love is a religion, but sensei really is my goddess.
<es>

@581
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi-kun, do you regret falling in love with such a troubled woman?"
<es>

@582
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please, don't say that. I don't want to hear that again."
<es>

@585
<en>{Mei}\n"Hee-hee, sorry."
<es>

@586
<en>I felt happy to hear her just say "sorry". I wanted to put sensei at ease. I didn't want to worry her anymore.
<es>

@587
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I promised you."
<es>

@588
<en>I looked at my pinky as I muttered. I had vowed not to make her worry or fret anymore.
<es>

@589
<en>What else can I do to ease her tension?
<es>

@590
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei..."
<es>

@591
<en>I don't know what I can do, but I want to do something for her. So I hugged her.
<es>

@594
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, Kazushi-kun?"
<es>

@595
<en>Sensei was puzzled. Still, I pulled her body in close.
<es>

@596
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will protect you."
<es>

@597
<en>It was sad that such a cheap line was the best I could come up with, but I wanted to protect her with everything I had, to protect her from her worries.
<es>

@600
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi-kun..."
<es>

@601
<en>Sensei lifted her head and her luscious lips trembled.
<es>

@602
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei..."
<es>

@604
<en>Then, we shared our second kiss. This time, it was deeper.
<es>

@605
<en>{Mei}\n"Mmm, ah, mmm..."
<es>

@606
<en>I heard sensei's sweet voice. The edges of our mouths were soon coated in each other's saliva.
<es>

@607
<en>We parted our lips.
<es>

@611
<en>{Mei}\n"Ah, aaah..."
<es>

@612
<en>Sensei let out some sweet sighs. I wanted to hear more of them. I wanted to be with her longer.
<es>

@613
<en>I wanted to hug her tighter.
<es>

@614
<en>{Mei}\n"Umm... what next?"
<es>

@615
<en>Mei muttered in my chest.
<es>

@616
<en>{Mei}\n"Hugging, kissing, that was as far as we went last time. But today...?"
<es>

@617
<en>Mei lifted her head. Her big eyes trembled with anxiety and anticipation.
<es>

@618
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Today we're..."
<es>

@619
<en>"Fear not", I told myself.
<es>

@620
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I want to know more about you, sensei. I want to be the person who knows the most about you."
<es>

@621
<en>{Mei}\n"Who knows the most?"
<es>

@622
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I want to see a sensei nobody else knows."
<es>

@623
<en>{Mei}\n"Nobody?"
<es>

@624
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, nobody. An Ibuki Mei that nobody else knows - not even you, sensei."
<es>

@625
<en>{Mei}\n"You mean..."
<es>

@626
<en>Sensei hung her head in hesitation as she finally realized what I meant.
<es>

@629
<en>{Mei}\n"If we do that...... Will you remember everything about me forever?"
<es>

@630
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course."
<es>

@631
<en>{Mei}\n"Then, will I be able to remember you forever, Kazushi-kun?"
<es>

@632
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry. You won't forget anything anymore."
<es>

@635
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't want to forget anything else. Kazushi-kun, carve yourself, carve memories of yourself into me..."
<es>
