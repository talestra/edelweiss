<en>{Mei}\n"I may be an udon noodle."
<es>

@10
<en>Sensei said as she slurped down her glistening udon noodles. I had no idea what she meant.
<es>

@11
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that some kind of riddle?"
<es>

@14
<en>{Mei}\n"Am I wrong?"
<es>

@15
<en>She asked with seriousness in her eyes. I guess she wasn't joking...
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm positive you're mistaken."
<es>

@19
<en>{Mei}\n"Really? Then I must be a homunculus?"
<es>

@20
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A homunculus?"
<es>

@21
<en>I never heard that word before, but it sounded familiar...
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that some cattle breed?"
<es>

@25
<en>{Mei}\n".........Holstein?"
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I guess not."
<es>

@29
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, you don't remember? You're kidding me?"
<es>

@30
<en>She looked at me like she couldn't believe it. Was it that common of a word?
<es>

@31
<en>{Mei}\n"I guess you really don't remember it. Hahh... maybe I didn't teach you well."
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean teach? Oh, was it something we covered in class?"
<es>

@35
<en>{Mei}\n"You can't recall it at all, can you? I'm going to have to be stricter come second semester."
<es>

@36
<en>I didn't get it, but I did think it would be nice if it stayed summer and second semester never came.
<es>

@39
<en>{Mei}\n"By the way, about yesterday..."
<es>

@40
<en>Her tone suddenly dropped.
<es>

@41
<en>I was angry that the first thing "yesterday" brought to mind was the Principal's face and not Mei-sensei's sleeping face.
<es>

@42
<en>{Mei}\n"When did I fall asleep last night?"
<es>

@43
<en>She asked me in a whisper. It was a secret conversation between the two of us.
<es>

@44
<en>My anger faded quite a bit.
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, about 4 o'clock? You fell asleep while we were talking."
<es>

@48
<en>{Mei}\n"Did I sleep in front of you, Kazushi-kun?"
<es>

@49
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, you did. Don't you remember it at all?"
<es>

@52
<en>{Mei}\n"No, I don't. I remember that I was tired."
<es>

@53
<en>She lowered her eyes in embarrassment and then glanced up at me.
<es>

@56
<en>{Mei}\n"Did you stay in my room all night?"
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I moved you to the bed and went home soon after."
<es>

@60
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh... so you were the one who laid me in bed."
<es>

@61
<en>Her cheeks blushed faintly. It was a rare treat to see sensei acting shy.
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You were sleeping with your face on the table. So, I picked you up like this, and carried you like a princess......"
<es>

@65
<en>{Mei}\n"Aaaaaiiiioooo!"
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@67
<en>Wh-what was the weird sound? Did it come from sensei?
<es>

@70
<en>{Mei}\n"What have I done?! Showing my defenseless side in front of my student... How could I be so careless?"
<es>

@71
<en>She held her head in her hands. I felt bad saying this, but watching Mei-sensei like that was quite a show.
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, perhaps because I'm not your student right now. Maybe that's why?"
<es>

@75
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, I know that was the agreement, but... still... did you look at my face while I slept?"
<es>

@76
<en>She asked me hesitantly.
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, I did. It was so cute..."
<es>

@80
<en>{Mei}\n"Hhhhhiiiii!"
<es>

@81
<en>She held her head again. Was this really Ibuki Mei?
<es>

@84
<en>{Mei}\n"It's already irregular for me to not have any make-up on, and on top of that he saw me while I slept..."
<es>

@85
<en>She was mumbling something to herself in shock. ...She's funny.
<es>

@88
<en>{Mei}\n"I can't believe it. It must be Meike-believe!"
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, what happened yesterday is a fact."
<es>

@92
<en>{Mei}\n"But I'm usually the type who's too worried to sleep when people are around. For me to sleep so defenselessly... you didn't slip in a sleeping pill, did you?"
<es>

@93
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, no, please don't go there."
<es>

@96
<en>{Mei}\n"No, maybe Kazushi-kun is my sleeping pill? My tranquilizer? No, that's just silly."
<es>

@97
<en>She was saying some embarrassing things. I could tell she was quite confused.
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei, just calm down."
<es>

@101
<en>{Mei}\n"Huh? Yes, of course I'm calm. I have to calm down and eat my meal. If I didn't eat, I'd just be a lump of meat."
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're eating now."
<es>

@105
<en>{Mei}\n"Umm, I may be an udon noodle?"
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't ask me. For now, just take a deep breath."
<es>

@109
<en>{Mei}\n"Phhhh.........Haa........."
<es>

@117
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh? Look at you two together."
<es>

@118
<en>The three of them came over with teasing grins.
<es>

@124
<en>{Mei}\n"O-oh, hello everyone."
<es>

@125
<en>They hadn't said anything to us, but sensei sat up straight and composed herself.
<es>

@129
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi, were you in the library all morning again?"
<es>

@130
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, sort of. I'm so tired now."
<es>

@131
<en>I went back to my room before around five o'clock last night, and I got up before eight this morning, so I slept less than three hours.
<es>

@136
<en>{Appo}\n"You must be tired since you weren't back until morning. Hee-hee-hee."
<es>

@140
<en>{Mei}\n"Grk!"
<es>

@141
<en>{Kazushi}\n"H-how did you know about that?"
<es>

@144
<en>{Appo}\n"We share the same room, so I can tell. When I got up to take a piss at night you weren't there. Then you were back by morning."
<es>

@148
<en>{Pierre}\n"Seriously? Then that means..."
<es>

@155
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi, did you finally..."
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I didn't. It's not like that..."
<es>

@162
<en>{Mei}\n"N-nothing happened. Really."
<es>

@163
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's right! Nothing like that happened..."
<es>

@171
<en>The three of them gave us cold stares as we desperately made excuses. It felt like the more heat was put on us, the colder their eyes grew...
<es>

@174
<en>{Pierre}\n"Ohh, I see. So you two were together last night then."
<es>

@175
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Grk!"
<es>

@178
<en>{Appo}\n"Man, I was half-joking. I didn't think I'd hit a bull's-eye."
<es>

@184
<en>{Mei}\n"Au, au, a, a-about that... Right! I was helping him study all night..."
<es>

@189
<en>{Pierre}\n"Private lessons until morning? Way to go, Kazushi. Can't believe tuition's the same."
<es>

@190
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Quit being so misleading. Nothing happened - honestly, okay?"
<es>

@198
<en>I glared at them to show how serious I was. They got the message and started whispering to each other in surprise.
<es>

@201
<en>{Daigo}\n"Hey, looks like he's serious."
<es>

@204
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah, I'm surprised. But it looks they really were together until morning. And nothing happened?"
<es>

@207
<en>{Appo}\n"It's unbelievable, madam. What does that say about him as a man? I'm sure she was hoping for something too."
<es>

@213
<en>{Mei}\n"Huh? By she you mean me? I wasn't hoping for anything..."
<es>

@214
<en>I knew she didn't because she was deep asleep.
<es>

@215
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh well. Here, hurry up and finish."
<es>

@223
<en>{Appo}\n"Yeah, fine, I'll let you off for now."
<es>

@226
<en>{Pierre}\n"Well, they have to go at their own pace. I know he's good for nothing, but take care of Kazushi, Mei-chan."
<es>

@232
<en>{Mei}\n"Huh? I-I'm, look..."
<es>

@237
<en>{Appo}\n"He's stupid and unreliable, so you might want to take the lead, Mei-chan."
<es>

@240
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm telling you, we are not..."
<es>

@244
<en>{Daigo}\n"Mei-sensei, you're beet red."
<es>

@245
<en>{Mei}\n"Argh, quit teasing your teacher!"
<es>

@246
<en>Even though sensei was mad, everyone else just grinned.
<es>

@247
<en>I can't blame them. Sensei was so totally cute as she got mad in front of everyone.
<es>

@254
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh yeah."
<es>

@255
<en>Sensei suddenly stopped on our way back to the library.
<es>

@256
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@259
<en>{Mei}\n"I forgot to go shopping, so I'll do it now."
<es>

@260
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, I'll go with you!"
<es>

@265
<en>It was quite new to walk the town together with sensei.
<es>

@266
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's like we're on a date."
<es>

@269
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't get carried away."
<es>

@270
<en>Sensei gave me a resolute warning now that she had her pace back. She was so cute when she was flustered, too.
<es>

@271
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what do you need here?"
<es>

@274
<en>{Mei}\n"I need stuff for the class. A great idea came to me, so I wanted to perform an experiment during the summer holiday."
<es>

@275
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So instruments for alchemy? Then I guess we're going to that store."
<es>

@280
<en>{Mei}\n"Hello~"
<es>

@281
<en>I could tell sensei had been here often by the friendly greeting she gave.
<es>

@286
<en>{Miya}\n"Hey, Mei-chan. Welcome. It's been a while."
<es>

@287
<en>The old shopkeeper came out with a smile. I think his name was Miya-san.
<es>

@288
<en>Miya-san looked really happy to see Mei-sensei.
<es>

@291
<en>{Mei}\n"It's been quite a while. I've been pretty busy with converting to co-ed."
<es>

@294
<en>{Miya}\n"I'm sure you have. I doubt you're used to dealing with young boys, Mei-chan."
<es>

@297
<en>{Mei}\n"It really has been nothing but new things."
<es>

@298
<en>I could feel the friendliness in their polite conversation. They might be closer than I thought.
<es>

@301
<en>{Miya}\n"Oh, you're..."
<es>

@302
<en>I guess he remembered my face, even though I only visited here once.
<es>

@303
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm Haruma. Good to see you."
<es>

@304
<en>{Miya}\n"Oh, right, right. Haruma Kazushi-kun, right?"
<es>

@305
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes."
<es>

@308
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, you two know each other?"
<es>

@309
<en>Mei-sensei looked happy, somehow.
<es>

@310
<en>{Miya}\n"It's a small island. Before it was just young girls and I had nothing to talk about, but I'm happy to see so many guys here now."
<es>

@313
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, you're not very comfortable around girls?"
<es>

@314
<en>She spoke teasingly and tauntingly. Miya-san just wore a polite, dry smile.
<es>

@317
<en>{Miya}\n"An old man like me is overwhelmed by the power of young girls."
<es>

@320
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh? I didn't think you were you actually that old?"
<es>

@321
<en>{Miya}\n"Oh no, here lately the ol' hips..."
<es>

@324
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh no, you really are old."
<es>

@325
<en>They had a friendly chat. They must be pretty close.
<es>

@326
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya-san, you've lived here for a long time, right?"
<es>

@327
<en>I wanted to know about when sensei was still a student. If he's been here since then, he must know about her school days.
<es>

@330
<en>{Miya}\n"Yeah, I guess. I've been here for over ten years now."
<es>

@333
<en>{Mei}\n"Despite his appearance, he used to be a talented alchemist whom the principal invited to this island."
<es>

@334
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Is that a true story?"
<es>

@335
<en>I remembered that Haruka mentioned that once. Miya-san denied it, though.
<es>

@336
<en>I thought she was joking because he didn't look like it at all. He looked more like a mediocre middle-aged man who lost his job because of restructuring.
<es>

@339
<en>{Miya}\n"Stop that, Mei-chan. If you say things like that, Haruma-kun will believe them."
<es>

@340
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Is it not true?"
<es>

@343
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh? I didn't think I was lying?"
<es>

@346
<en>{Miya}\n"No, no, it's a big lie. Yeah, I did dabble in alchemy back in the day, but I had no talent for it and I've cut my ties with it."
<es>

@347
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@348
<en>Maybe he was just humbling himself. Otherwise, his story was totally different from sensei's. Sensei just smiled, never interrupting him.
<es>

@351
<en>{Miya}\n"But you know I have to make a living, so I opened this shop to at least subsist from. I have no talent, so this was all I had."
<es>

@352
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see..."
<es>

@353
<en>That's exactly how he seemed, so it made sense. He did have a connection to alchemy, but not enough to call it talent.
<es>

@354
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, then you know the principal, don't you?"
<es>

@355
<en>I remember this morning that the principal warned me not to get involved with Mei-sensei.
<es>

@358
<en>{Miya}\n"Of course. I at least tried practicing alchemy on this island, so I'd obviously know her. I knew her before I even came to this island, so for about 20 years now."
<es>

@359
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@360
<en>This man might know something. If he treats Mei-sensei like a daughter and he's known the principal for a long time, then...
<es>

@364
<en>{Mei}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@365
<en>Mei-sensei peered at me with concern as I became lost in thought. I was worried about what the principal said, but I couldn't ask that in front of her.
<es>

@366
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nothing. Well, what about your shopping?"
<es>

@369
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, I almost forgot about it. Can I take a look inside?"
<es>

@374
<en>{Miya}\n"Go right ahead. Help yourself."
<es>

@378
<en>Sensei walked towards the back.
<es>

@381
<en>{Miya}\n"Still, it's pretty rare for you to bring a student here, Mei-chan."
<es>

@382
<en>He carefully sized me up.
<es>

@383
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is it that rare? But sensei's popular, so it feels like she's always surrounded by people."
<es>

@386
<en>{Miya}\n"That's just for show. Alchemists are fundamentally secretive. They don't show all their cards."
<es>

@387
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that right?"
<es>

@388
<en>{Miya}\n"I wonder what changed her mind."
<es>

@393
<en>{Mei}\n"Excuse me, sir. Don't go giving Kazushi-kun any strange ideas, okay?"
<es>

@394
<en>I guess she heard Miya-san, since she glared at us from in back. Miya-san shrugged his shoulders and played dumb.
<es>

@397
<en>{Miya}\n"I just said what came to mind."
<es>

@400
<en>{Mei}\n"I haven't changed my mind at all. I thought it would be a great idea to get a boy's opinion from Kazushi-kun......"
<es>

@403
<en>{Miya}\n"I think that counts as changing your mind."
<es>

@406
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, after all, it's my first time teaching boys. It's a lot different, so I've learned a lot from them."
<es>

@407
<en>Sensei was pouting a little. Maybe she was relying on him because Miya-san's an adult? I was kind of jealous that he was getting it.
<es>

@410
<en>{Miya}\n"Still, I think there's meaning behind you choosing Haruma-kun. If you're an alchemist, you should value your intuition."
<es>

@411
<en>{Mei}\n"It wasn't really intuition, though. Ahh, how should I explain..."
<es>

@412
<en>Sensei ran out of arguments and fell silent. Miya-san looked kind and fatherly as he watched over her.
<es>

@415
<en>{Miya}\n"Well, I think I'll call that enough teasing, Mei-chan."
<es>

@418
<en>{Mei}\n"Sheesh, really, you are mean."
<es>

@419
<en>Sensei looked so cute as she pouted. Miya-san watched over her with a gently, happy smile.
<es>

@420
<en>It was such a heartwarming scene. Yes, as if...
<es>

@421
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You guys look like father and daughter."
<es>

@422
<en>It looked as if they were father and daughter. Mei-sensei looked surprised when I spoke my mind, but Miya-san continued to smile softly.
<es>

@425
<en>{Miya}\n"That's right. Mei-chan is like a daughter to me."
<es>

@426
<en>His smile was exactly like the one a father would show his daughter, and it burned itself in my mind.
<es>

@427
<en>I wonder if he had a family? It wouldn't be strange for him to have a daughter or two at his age.
<es>

@428
<en>Well, I'm not close enough to ask him about it, so I'll just let it go.
<es>

@435
<en>{Miya}\n"You sure got a lot. Can you carry it all?"
<es>

@436
<en>{Mei}\n"Somehow... Ungh..."
<es>

@437
<en>She tried to lift one of the parcels, but wobbled unsteadily.
<es>

@438
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't force yourself, sensei. I can carry it all."
<es>

@439
<en>When I tried to reach over the stuff, she pulled the parcel back toward her.
<es>

@442
<en>{Mei}\n"I can handle this. We'll split it half and half."
<es>

@443
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's alright. You just carry this little one, and I'll carry the rest."
<es>

@446
<en>{Mei}\n"Ah, hey, you cheeky boy."
<es>

@449
<en>I took the parcels away from her and she pouted. Miya-san laughed at the sight.
<es>

@450
<en>{Miya}\n"Ah, hah, hah, you two make a good combination. It might be good for Mei-chan to have a guy like you around, Haruma-kun."
<es>

@451
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, you think so? Hear that, sensei?"
<es>

@454
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't get carried away. Come on, let's go."
<es>

@455
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure."
<es>

@456
<en>When I picked them up, I remembered something.
<es>

@457
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, right. Please go on ahead."
<es>

@459
<en>I said to sensei, putting the parcels down. There was something I wanted to find out from Miya-san without Mei-sensei knowing.
<es>

@462
<en>{Mei}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@463
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Just a little man-to-man talk."
<es>

@466
<en>{Miya}\n"With me?"
<es>

@467
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you mind?"
<es>

@468
<en>{Miya}\n"No, I don't mind, but..."
<es>

@469
<en>He was worried about sensei.
<es>

@472
<en>{Mei}\n"Then I'll wait for you outside. Make it quick."
<es>

@480
<en>Sensei left the shop. Now it was just us men.
<es>

@481
<en>{Miya}\n"What is it? Is it about Mei-chan?"
<es>

@482
<en>He's sharp. Maybe he really is more than an average middle-aged man.
<es>

@483
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You said you knew the principal well, didn't you?"
<es>

@484
<en>I still remembered the principal's warning not to get involved with Mei-sensei from last night. I wanted to know the truth behind those words.

@485
<en>If he considers Mei-sensei to be like a daughter and he knows the principal well, then maybe he might know something.
<es>

@486
<en>{Miya}\n"What about Hisae-san?"
<es>

@488
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, actually......"
<es>

@489
<en>I told him everything about this morning - about my feelings for sensei, that I was warned not get involved, and that I had already confessed.
<es>

@490
<en>Miya-san was an outsider who knew a lot about the academy, so it was easy to talk frankly with him.
<es>

@491
<en>{Miya}\n"I see... so you fell in love with Mei-chan, huh, Haruma-kun."
<es>

@492
<en>He mumbled, rather impressed, and then thought for a moment.
<es>

@493
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um..."
<es>

@496
<en>{Miya}\n"Haruma-kun, you know that Mei-chan's lost the memories of her past, correct?"
<es>

@497
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, she told me."
<es>

@500
<en>{Miya}\n"I see. Mei-chan told you herself. Uh-huh..."
<es>

@501
<en>He fell silent again. It was a very heavy silence. After grunting to himself a few times, Miya-san opened his mouth.
<es>

@504
<en>{Miya}\n"I said this before, but I consider myself like a father to Mei-chan. And if I'm the father, then Hisae-san would be the mother."
<es>

@505
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? The principal?"
<es>

@506
<en>Oh yeah, Mei-sensei called the principal "Hisae-san" too. I thought those two looked closer than I thought.
<es>

@507
<en>{Miya}\n"You may wonder why, but I want you to think of us as her guardians ever since she lost her memories. We're like her foster parents on this island."
<es>

@508
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Foster parents..."
<es>

@509
<en>The relationship between Mei-sensei and Miya-san was deeper than I thought. Furthermore, the principal was involved too.
<es>

@510
<en>I wonder what happened in Mei-sensei's past.
<es>

@513
<en>{Miya}\n"That's why I think I have the right to say this too. My reason is different from Hisae-san's, but I can't approve of you being with Mei-chan either."
<es>

@514
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can't?"
<es>

@515
<en>I was shocked. I was expecting a positive answer from a gentle guy like him.
<es>

@516
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, before you say yes or no, I still haven't gotten an okay from sensei yet."
<es>

@519
<en>{Miya}\n"Ahaha, I'm sure not. I've never heard any love stories about Mei-chan before."
<es>

@520
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Speaking of that, sensei graduated from the academy, right? Do you know about how sensei was back then, Miya-san?"
<es>

@521
<en>I meant about sensei before the accident where she lost her memories. If he was like her parent, I'm sure he must have known. The old man frowned and shook his head.
<es>

@524
<en>{Miya}\n"Unfortunately, I don't know much about Mei-chan from back then."
<es>

@525
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? You don't?"
<es>

@526
<en>I thought he'd know since he was like her father.
<es>

@529
<en>{Miya}\n"I think the only person left at the academy who would know about those days would be Hisae-san."
<es>

@530
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see..."
<es>

@531
<en>Only the principal knows, huh? Why do I get the feeling something's fishy if the principal's involved?
<es>

@532
<en>I don't want to think that since it's about sensei.
<es>

@533
<en>{Miya}\n"If you could, I hope you won't think badly of Hisae-san."
<es>

@534
<en>I was emotional when I saw the sad smile on his face. For a moment, I couldn't say a word.
<es>

@535
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um...well..."
<es>

@538
<en>{Miya}\n"Oh, sorry, sorry. Well, I'm just running my mouth, but I'd be happy if you could keep that in the back of your mind."
<es>

@539
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah..."
<es>

@540
<en>I don't know why we're talking about the principal now instead of Mei-sensei.
<es>

@541
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi-kun! Done yet?"
<es>

@542
<en>Sensei was calling for me from outside. I'd kept her waiting longer than "a little bit".
<es>

@545
<en>{Miya}\n"I think you should be getting along now. Nothing good ever comes from a girl in a foul mood."
<es>

@546
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That from experience?"
<es>

@549
<en>{Miya}\n"Ahaha, maybe."
<es>

@550
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi-kun!"
<es>

@551
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, shit! She's getting angry."
<es>

@554
<en>{Miya}\n"Go on, it's almost lunchtime. I'm sure she's hungry."
<es>

@555
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, you may be right! Well then, I'll be off!"
<es>

@558
<en>{Miya}\n"Yeah, come back anytime. I'll try to be of help."
<es>

@559
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure! Thanks!"
<es>

@566
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hey, Harucchi, what do you want to eat tomorrow?"
<es>

@567
<en>Sakura asked at the dinner table.
<es>

@568
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is it your turn to cook tomorrow, Sakura?"
<es>

@573
<en>{Pierre}\n"That means I can eat Rin-chan's food. I can't wait for that."
<es>

@576
<en>{Sakura}\n"What does that mean? You not looking forward to my cooking?"
<es>

@579
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh, no, I didn't say that. Sakura-chan, you look scary!"
<es>

@580
<en>{Sakura}\n"Grrrrrrrrr."
<es>

@584
<en>{Rin}\n"I always worry about the menu, and Sakura never gives any useful suggestions."
<es>

@588
<en>{Appo}\n"Sakura doesn't know how to cook. Fuu-chan's a really great cook though. Sakura, where does that put you as a woman?"
<es>

@591
<en>{Sakura}\n"What's with this away game? What day is it today?"
<es>

@595
<en>{Rin}\n"So, I'd like to hear everyone's opinion. What would you all like to eat?"
<es>

@596
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's see... Curry?"
<es>

@599
<en>{Sakura}\n"Huh? Curry again? There's a lot of boys who said curry."
<es>

@600
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@604
<en>{Daigo}\n"I could eat curry every day for six months straight."
<es>

@611
<en>{Rin}\n"That's a bit too much. Curry's nice and simple, but I'd rather make something other than curry tomorrow."
<es>

@615
<en>{Appo}\n"Then hamburgers?"
<es>

@619
<en>{Pierre}\n"Spaghetti?"
<es>

@622
<en>{Sakura}\n"These guys are kids."
<es>

@626
<en>{Daigo}\n"What's wrong with curry?"
<es>

@629
<en>{Sakura}\n"I told you we don't make that."
<es>

@635
<en>{Haruka}\n"What-what? What's going on here?"
<es>

@636
<en>Haruka joined us along with Mizuki and Ran.
<es>

@642
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? Tomorrow's menu? Oh, tomorrow's your turn, Rin? I can't wait."
<es>

@643
<en>{Ran}\n"You could charge 1,280 yen for Rin's food at a restaurant. If you're up for it, would you want to open one with me as the manager?"
<es>

@648
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, you sound like you're having fun. What are you talking about?"
<es>

@649
<en>Mei-sensei came right as we were having fun. I wonder if she sniffed out the topic of food.
<es>

@650
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, good timing. What do you feel like eating tomorrow, sensei?"
<es>

@651
<en>We'd better ask Mei-sensei's opinion when it comes to food.
<es>

@658
<en>{Rin}\n"It's our turn tomorrow, so..."
<es>

@659
<en>{Sakura}\n"We're asking everyone what they want to eat."
<es>

@662
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, it's your turn tomorrow, Fujisaki-san? I can't wait."
<es>

@665
<en>{Sakura}\n"Here you go again. I am worthless in this world?"
<es>

@666
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't think, just live."
<es>

@667
<en>{Rin}\n"What would you like, sensei?"
<es>

@670
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, I kind of feel like shark's fin tomorrow."
<es>

@675
<en>{Everybody}\n"Shark's fin!?"
<es>

@676
<en>Mei-sensei suggested a gorgeous menu.
<es>

@683
<en>{Rin}\n"Th-that's our Mei-sensei. Her ideas are completely different."
<es>

@684
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah, no one'd ever think of shark's fin as dorm food."
<es>

@688
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, really? You need to think more flexibly or you'll end up a NEET."
<es>

@692
<en>{Sakura}\n"Can we even get shark's fin on this island?"
<es>

@695
<en>{Mei}\n"There's an ocean, isn't there?"
<es>

@700
<en>{Appo}\n"You can catch shark fillets in the ocean?"
<es>

@701
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I thought we were talking about beef. You said fillets, right? A sharp fillet?"
<es>

@706
<en>{Haruka}\n"Huh? You can catch fillets in the ocean?"
<es>

@710
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You can? I've never seen a fillet when I was out swimming."
<es>

@714
<en>{Pierre}\n"Then let's go fishing now!"
<es>

@718
<en>{Haruka}\n"Fishing? I'd love to go, too! Teach me how to fish, Kazushi-kun!"
<es>

@719
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Alright, then let's all go together! We'll have an all-you-can-eat fillet party!"
<es>

@726
<en>{Daigo}\n"I'd prefer a roast more, though."
<es>

@732
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, you guys are stupid, aren't you?"
<es>

@737
<en>{Rin}\n"Umm, so tomorrow we should have fillet cutlet?"
<es>

@741
<en>{Mei}\n"You guys really don't know about shark's fin?"
<es>

@742
<en>{Rin}\n"Umm, so tomorrow's dinner is?"
<es>

@747
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I never knew she meant a shark's fin."
<es>

@750
<en>{Appo}\n"I didn't know you could eat shark."
<es>

@751
<en>I learned something new from our amnesic sensei.\nWell, she is a teacher, so I'm always learning from her.
<es>

@752
<en>Now that I think about it, I'm surprised she can still teach without her memory. She didn't forget anything about alchemy.
<es>

@755
<en>{Appo}\n"I heard you can sometimes catch sharks in the ocean nearby. Fuu-chan said so, and Fuu-chan knows everything."
<es>

@756
<en>Lately, Appo loved to brag about his girlfriend if we gave him the chance.
<es>

@759
<en>{Appo}\n"Fuu-chan could be an angel..."
<es>

@760
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? There are sharks around here? Then shouldn't we avoid swimming here?"
<es>

@763
<en>{Appo}\n"Huh? Yeah, but only sometimes. There's a special bait apparently. They probably make it with alchemy."
<es>

@764
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, creating bait for sharks? Alchemy's amazing."
<es>

@765
<en>If there is such a thing that'll let ever me catch a shark easily, then I could give sensei some shark's fin as a present. Food would probably score big points with her.
<es>

@766
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you know where that bait for sharks is?"
<es>

@767
<en>{Appo}\n"Wouldn't the fishermen have it? Also, Panchu-sempai's been into fishing too lately."
<es>

@768
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sempai, huh?"
<es>

@773
<en>I found sempai watching the sea. He looked cool and manly as he gazed at the deep.
<es>

@774
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sempai."
<es>

@777
<en>{Panchu}\n"......Ka'ushi, huh?"
<es>

@778
<en>He responded without turning around. He kept looking at the ocean, but I wonder what he saw?
<es>

@779
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you looking at?"
<es>

@780
<en>The waves were very calm and gentle tonight.
<es>

@783
<en>{Panchu}\n"Thi''ll 'et cho''y."
<es>

@784
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Choppy?"
<es>

@785
<en>What?
<es>

@788
<en>{Panchu}\n"I''ll 'et 'ough an' ''ormy."
<es>

@789
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? The sea will? But it's so calm..."
<es>

@790
<en>I couldn't believe it, but if sempai says so, it may be true.
<es>

@791
<en>{Panchu}\n"Why are 'ou 'ere?"
<es>

@792
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh, oh, right. I had a question for you, sempai. Do you know where I can get shark bait?"
<es>

@795
<en>{Panchu}\n"'his?"
<es>

@796
<en>He pointed at his feet. There was a plastic bag, and inside it was melon-pan.
<es>

@797
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is melon-pan."
<es>

@800
<en>{Panchu}\n"I ma'e 'hi' wi'h al'hemy. I 'on'' 'now why, 'ut i' 'ures shar's. 'hey 'i'e e'ery 'ast."
<es>

@801
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You made this, sempai!?"
<es>

@802
<en>That's sempai for you! He made bait that could lure a shark with every cast without even knowing what he did.
<es>

@803
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you think I could have a little bit of that? I really want some shark's fin."
<es>

@806
<en>{Panchu}\n"Shar' 'in, huh..."
<es>

@807
<en>He looked up the sky. I wonder if something resembling shark fin is up there?
<es>

@808
<en>{Kazushi}\n"............"
<es>

@809
<en>I looked up at the sky, but I didn't see anything like it. But I couldn't say that either, so I quietly watched sempai.
<es>

@810
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi-kun."
<es>

@811
<en>My favorite voice called my name from behind us. It was Mei-sensei.
<es>

@816
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, Iida-kun too. It's dangerous if you get too close to the sea."
<es>

@817
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Dangerous?"
<es>

@820
<en>{Mei}\n"They said there's a typhoon on its way. We might be getting high waves."
<es>

@821
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A typhoon?"
<es>

@822
<en>I glanced at sempai. Panchu-sempai was still looking at the sea. I guess he was right about it getting choppy.
<es>

@825
<en>{Panchu}\n"You 'ear' her, so 'ive u' on 'ishin'."
<es>

@828
<en>{Mei}\n"Fishing? You positively can not. Wait two or three days for the typhoon to pass by before you do. The waves are usually high in midsummer, and we might get even higher ones."
<es>

@829
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see..."
<es>

@832
<en>{Mei}\n"You absolutely can not, okay? Please promise me."
<es>

@833
<en>She held her pinky up to me. Her finger was small and cute with a nail that shone like a glossy pearl.
<es>

@834
<en>But I felt embarrassed to make a pinky swear in front of sempai. He might think I'm trying to hit on her.
<es>

@838
<en>{Mei}\n"Here, promise me."
<es>

@839
<en>She grew worried as I didn't stick out my pinky, so she grabbed my arm and forced my pinky around hers.
<es>

@842
<en>{Mei}\n"Okay, cross my heart and hope to die!"
<es>

@843
<en>With a singsong chant, she shook our pinkies.
<es>

@848
<en>{Panchu}\n"Heh..."
<es>

@849
<en>I heard sempai let out a stifled laugh. I felt like he was laughing at me because sensei treated me like a kid, and my face grew flush with embarrassment.
<es>

@850
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Th-that's enough, right? I get it."
<es>

@854
<en>I pulled my pinky away. Sensei looked a little puzzled, but quickly went back to looking like our teacher.
<es>

@857
<en>{Mei}\n"It's a promise. Okay?"
<es>

@858
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah..."
<es>

@859
<en>I couldn't just say yes because sempai was watching us, I guess. That or because I felt like I was being treated like a kid.
<es>

@862
<en>{Mei}\n"Come on. It's about to rain and it'll be dark soon. Head on back to your dorm. Iida-kun, you too."
<es>

@866
<en>{Panchu}\n"Yup."
<es>

@867
<en>After that brief reply, he turned around and headed back.
<es>

@871
<en>{Mei}\n"You head back too, Kazushi-kun. Come on, let's go back together."
<es>

@872
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, sure..."
<es>

@874
<en>*Rustle...*
<es>

@875
<en>I hit something as I started to walk. It was the plastic bag from where sempai was standing.
<es>

@876
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@879
<en>{Mei}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@880
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, nothing..."
<es>

@882
<en>I picked up the plastic bag and followed after her.
<es>

@883
<en>Bait that sharks always bite on. If I can get some shark's fin, I'm sure sensei will appreciate me more.
<es>

@889
<en>I woke up to the roaring of the wind the next morning.
<es>

@890
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I never knew my sleep could be interrupted by mere wind."
<es>

@891
<en>It was really loud, though. I took a look outside.
<es>

@894
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Woooah..."
<es>

@895
<en>The sky was howling. It wasn't bad on the ground, but high up in the sky, the winds were roaring.
<es>

@896
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wooooooah!!"
<es>

@897
<en>I could feel a huge mass of energy pass over my head. We were in a severe low-pressure system.
<es>

@898
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Here it comes, here it comes!!"
<es>

@899
<en>I was getting excited! I never could sit still on days we had a typhoon!
<es>

@900
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I feel like I can do anything right now!"
<es>

@901
<en>I should use this power effectively. I should do something.
<es>

@902
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No question about it. Okay!"
<es>

@903
<en>I popped back into our dorm room. I'm sure it was destiny that sempai forgot it yesterday and that I picked it up!
<es>

@905
<en>{Kazushi}\n"SHARK'S FIN!!"
<es>

@912
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, it's already ten. Kazushi-kun's late today."

<es>

@933

<es>

@934
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Woooooahh!"
<es>

@935
<en>The fierce wind blew strong. If I zoned out for even a second, I would get blown away. I stood my ground and kept myself from falling.
<es>

@936
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ohhhhhhh!!"
<es>

@937
<en>There was no reason behind my screams. It was just kind of like the energy inside me was gushing out of my mouth.
<es>

@938
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Man, they're going crazy..."
<es>

@939
<en>I'd never seen the sea rolling this much before. I felt shivers coming from within me.
<es>

@940
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay, I think this might be looking a little bad..."
<es>

@941

@943
<en>*Tug... tug...*
<es>

@944
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@945
<en>As soon as I started to feel discouraged, the rod bent low. With both of my hands holding onto the rod, I could tell I certainly hadn't caught a fish.
<es>

@946
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No way, I hooked one?"
<es>

@947
<en>I snapped out of it and tugged hard on the rod. There was amazing resistance.

<en>A giant fish leapt up out of the gray sea, arcing over the water before disappearing back in. Then it pulled really hard again.
<es>

@954
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I really hooked it!"
<es>

@955
<en>It was a real shark! And a huge one too! I was scared of it!
<es>

@956
<en>{Kazushi}\n"B-but this is my chance to give sensei some shark's fin! I have to show her I can do something when I try!"
<es>

@960
<en>The giant fish rode the wave and danced flew through the air.
<es>

@961
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ggaaahh!! I-it's heavy!!"
<es>

@962
<en>O-oh, shit! It's pulling really hard! It's going to drag me in with it!
<es>

@963
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ggaah, aaaah, haaaaaaaah! I-I can't!!"
<es>

@964
<en>Mei-sensei, I'm sorry!
<es>

@967
<en>{Panchu}\n"Don'' 'ive up!"
<es>

@968
<en>I heard a strong, reliable voice. Thick, manly arms reached around me and grabbed a firm hold on my rod.
<es>

@969
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Panchu-sempai!!"
<es>

@980
<en>{Mei}\n"Huh? Kazushi-kun is missing?"
<es>

@981
<en>Mei set the ramen noodles she was just about to eat back into her bowl.
<es>

@984
<en>{Mei}\n"What do you mean he's missing?"
<es>

@991
<en>{Appo}\n"I haven't seen him around since this morning. He wasn't there when I got up."
<es>

@992
<en>{Pierre}\n"It's not like him to skip dinner either. I tried looking around, but he wasn't anywhere."
<es>

@995
<en>{Mei}\n"So he's not in the dorm? And you looked outside, too?"
<es>

@999
<en>{Daigo}\n"We were looking outside, but then it started raining hard, so..."
<es>

@1004
<en>{Mei}\n"Right. I suppose he wouldn't be out in this rain... Has anyone seen Haruma Kazushi-kun?"
<es>

@1006
<en>Mei asked everyone in the cafeteria. Everyone looked at each other, but no one knew anything.
<es>

@1009
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, dear. Does anyone have any idea where he may have gone? How about you all?"
<es>

@1010
<en>She asked the three guys. They looked at each other.
<es>

@1018
<en>{Pierre}\n"I haven't heard anything. The only place I can think of is the library where you are, Mei-chan."
<es>

@1021
<en>{Daigo}\n"Same here. Hey, Appo, didn't Kazushi say something last night?"
<es>

@1024
<en>{Appo}\n"Hmm... Oh, you're right. Something about fishing."
<es>

@1025
<en>Mei flared up as Appo casually dropped that word.
<es>

@1031
<en>{Mei}\n"Huh? Fishing?"
<es>

@1032
<en>Of course, Mei remembered the promise he made yesterday. She shook her head strongly.
<es>

@1033
<en>{Mei}\n"No he didn't. I warned him not to last night, and he promised not to go fishing until after the typhoon had passed."
<es>

@1038
<en>{Appo}\n"Did he? Then I have no idea, but I don't think he mentioned anything other than fishing up a shark last night."
<es>

@1041
<en>{Mei}\n"Huh? Shark? Fishing up a shark? Why would he..."
<es>

@1045
<en>{Haruka}\n"Wouldn't that be for shark's fin?"
<es>

@1046
<en>Haruka had been watching the conversation, and raised her hand before speaking.
<es>

@1050
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh, we talked about that yesterday. You said you wanted to eat shark's fin, Mei-chan."
<es>

@1053
<en>{Mei}\n"Huh..."
<es>

@1057
<en>{Rin}\n"Then maybe Haruma-kun went fishing for shark's fin?"
<es>

@1058
<en>Mei was terrified. Kazushi could be out there fishing in that storm, all thanks to a comment she made in jest.
<es>

@1062
<en>{Mei}\n"No, he can't be... Look at this weather. And he promised me he wouldn't go fishing until the typhoon passed."
<es>

@1067
<en>{Daigo}\n"He probably wanted you to eat it, Mei-sensei."
<es>

@1070
<en>Daigo's voice echoed all over the room and Mei was astounded once again.
<es>

@1071
<en>{Mei}\n"For me?"
<es>

@1075
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah, he may be right. Kazushi always gets hyper when a typhoon rolls in. He may have ran off to do it without thinking."
<es>

@1078
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, no..."
<es>

@1088
<en>{Yagami}\n"Hey! One of you guys come give me a hand!!"
<es>

@1089
<en>When Yagami came running in, all eyes in the cafeteria fell on him. He was panicking that badly, and it was rare for him to even get flustered.
<es>

@1094
<en>{Mei}\n"Yagami-sensei! What's going on?!"
<es>

@1095
<en>{Yagami}\n"Ibuki-sensei. Umm, well, a shark..."
<es>

@1098
<en>{Mei}\n"Huh? Shark...? You don't mean Kazushi-kun..."
<es>

@1099
<en>{Yagami}\n"Yes, Kazushi went fishing, it seems."
<es>

@1100
<en>For a moment Mei's sight went black. She nearly fell, but somehow managed to stabilize herself.
<es>

@1103
<en>{Mei}\n"S-so Kazushi-kun is...?"
<es>

@1106
<en>At that moment they heard a bunch of people heading their way.
<es>

@1110
<en>{Yagami}\n"Over here!"
<es>

@1112
<en>After Yagami shouted, a bunch of guys ran into the cafeteria. They were dragging a large shark behind them.
<es>

@1114
<en>It looked dead, but there were rows of sharp teeth lining its mouth, and everyone noticed a familiar shirt clinging to its teeth.
<es>

@1119
<en>{Daigo}\n"That's our male uniform... isn't it?"
<es>

@1120
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh?! Don't tell me it's Kazushi's?!"
<es>

@1124
<en>{Mei}\n"N-no... th-then Kazushi-kun was... by the shark... aahh..."
<es>

@1128
<en>{Appo}\n"Did it swallow him?"
<es>

@1132
<en>{Pierre}\n"Th-then Kazushi's in this shark's belly...?"
<es>

@1135
<en>{Mei}\n"The shark's belly... aaahh..."
<es>

@1136
<en>Mei's already pale face grew even paler. The strength in her legs gave out, and she slid to the floor.
<es>

@1140
<en>{Haruka}\n"Mei-chan, hang in there!"
<es>

@1144
<en>{Ran}\n"Right now we need to save Kazushi!"
<es>

@1148
<en>{Pierre}\n"Just cut it open and save Kazushi? You serious?"
<es>

@1152
<en>{Appo}\n"Kazushi's so delicious."
<es>

@1159
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Isn't this not the time for jokes, guys?"
<es>

@1163
<en>{Haruka}\n"For now, let's get Mei-chan to the nurse's office."
<es>

@1169
<en>{Mei}\n"K-Kazushi-kun!!"
<es>

@1174
<en>{Haruka}\n"Wahh! She's back!"
<es>

@1177
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi-kun?! Hey, where's Kazushi-kun?!"
<es>

@1178
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sensei, calm down. We're all about to save him."
<es>

@1181
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi-kun..."
<es>

@1185
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Mei-sensei, are you okay? You look pale?"
<es>

@1189
<en>{Sakura}\n"You may want to lay down and rest for a while. Can you guys bring us a stretcher?"
<es>

@1192
<en>{Mei}\n"No... I-I'm fine. I'll stay here too."
<es>

@1196
<en>{Haruka}\n"But you look very bad? I think you need to rest."
<es>

@1199
<en>{Mei}\n"I am Kazushi-kun's teacher... even in the summer, he is my responsibility."
<es>

@1200
<en>She stoutly stood up, but her body was dangerously wobbling. Everyone watching her had a cold sweat.
<es>

@1205
<en>{Yagami}\n"Bring me a carver!"
<es>

@1210
<en>{Appo}\n"S-sure!"
<es>

@1211
<en>Appo dashed out and came back with a carving knife, handing it to Yagami.
<es>

@1220
<en>{Rin}\n"A-are you going to cut it open and save Haruma-kun?"
<es>

@1221
<en>{Ran}\n"Wasn't there a fairy tale like that?"
<es>

@1222
<en>{Mei}\n"K-Kazushi-kun..."
<es>

@1223
<en>Yagami swung the knife down as everyone watched with bated breath.
<es>

@1229
<en>{Yagami}\n"Hmmph!"
<es>

@1231
<en>Be it the blade on the knife or Yagami's good skill, the knife sank into the shark with hardly any noise.
<es>

@1238
<en>{Sakura}\n"Harucchi, are you still alive..."
<es>

@1239
<en>{Haruka}\n"No... Don't say such ominous things..."
<es>

@1242
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, please, God... I pray for you to bring Kazushi-kun back..."
<es>

@1246
<en>Yagami's carver slit open the shark's stomach. Everyone looked on from a distance as its belly spread further apart.
<es>

@1249
<en>{Yagami}\n"Kazushi!"
<es>

@1250
<en>Yagami shouted at the shark's stomach.
<es>

@1254
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes?"
<es>

@1255
<en>However, his reply came from behind. Everyone turned around at once.
<es>

@1256
<en>There stood Kazushi, soaking wet and leaning on Panchu's shoulder.
<es>

@1259
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi, kun?"
<es>

@1260
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah? What's all the fuss about?"
<es>

@1263
<en>It seems they thought I was swallowed by the shark. I was surprised when I heard it.
<es>

@1264
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How did you all get that idea?"
<es>

@1267
<en>{Yagami}\n"That's what I want to know. Where did all this get mixed up?"
<es>

@1268
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I caught a huge one, so I called everyone to help carry it."
<es>

@1272
<en>{Haruka}\n"And that wound?"
<es>

@1273
<en>I had a light injury to my head. Mei-sensei was already wrapping a bandage around it.
<es>

@1274
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That shark didn't know when to quit struggling. It flopped up and tried to bite me..."
<es>

@1278
<en>{Mei}\n"......!!"
<es>

@1279
<en>For a second, Mei-sensei's hands stopped wrapping the bandage.
<es>

@1284
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hold on, are you serious?"
<es>

@1285
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Dead serious. Panchu-sempai was awesome! He silenced the raging shark with his iron fist."
<es>

@1289
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's amazing. It's not human."
<es>

@1290
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Tell me about it. Who knows what would've happened if sempai wasn't there. I might actually be inside the shark by now."
<es>

@1293
<en>{Mei}\n"......!!"
<es>

@1297
<en>{Daigo}\n"I can't laugh at that."
<es>

@1298
<en>Sensei finished wrapping the bandage with her shaking hands.
<es>

@1299
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thank you very much."
<es>

@1303
<en>{Mei}\n"..............."
<es>

@1304
<en>Sensei didn't reply. I don't think she's said a word since I got here...
<es>

@1305
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sense--"
<es>

@1306
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi-kun."
<es>

@1307
<en>She finally spoke. She was shaking a little.
<es>

@1308
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei, I think you should rest. You still look pale."
<es>

@1309
<en>Especially her lips, which were purple from lack of blood. She looked exhausted.
<es>

@1310
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm fine. By the way, Kazushi-kun. Are you hurt anywhere else?"
<es>

@1311
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I'm okay now."
<es>

@1312
<en>{Mei}\n"I see...Then, I don't need to worry anymore."
<es>

@1313
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Worry?"
<es>

@1317
<en>Sensei raised her head quickly and glared directly at me. Her big eyes were full of tears.
<es>

@1318
<en>I was very upset when I saw the tears in her eyes.
<es>

@1319
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm, sensei...?"
<es>

@1320
<en>{Mei}\n"YOU IDIOT!!"
<es>

@1324
<en>My face spun as far as my neck would turn. Then I started feeling a hot warmth on my cheek. It felt like half my face was numb, and all it could feel was that heat.
<es>

@1325
<en>It took me quite a while before I realized that sensei had slapped me.
<es>

@1332
<en>{Appo}\n"Dayum, intense."
<es>

@1333
<en>{Daigo}\n"Mei-sensei slapped Kazushi..."
<es>

@1334
<en>{Yagami}\n"Ibuki-sensei hit someone..."
<es>

@1335
<en>Even Yagami-sensei was stunned - especially since he'd been fighting against Mei-sensei's objection to physical punishment.
<es>

@1341
<en>{Mei}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@1342
<en>Mei-sensei opened her eyes wide in shock as she looked back and forth between her hand and my cheek, surprised at what she'd just done.
<es>

@1343
<en>{Mei}\n"Uh, umm, I... I'm sorry!!"
<es>

@1347
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah, sensei?!"
<es>

@1348
<en>Sensei suddenly dashed off, fleeing the nurse's office.
<es>

@1351
<en>{Daigo}\n"She fled."
<es>

@1355
<en>{Yagami}\n"Man, I can't believe Ibuki-sensei slapped Kazushi. She must be extremely angry."
<es>

@1356
<en>Yagami-sensei muttered with little care. Actually, he sounded like he was enjoying it.
<es>

@1357
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, why is she that angry?"
<es>

@1360
<en>{Yagami}\n"Look you, you have to be crazy to go out fishing in the middle of this storm, not to mention for sharks. If Ibuki-sensei hadn't hit you, I would have."
<es>

@1361
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see......"
<es>

@1362
<en>I got excited by the typhoon and acted without thinking, but yeah, that was dangerous. If sempai hadn't been there, I'd have been in serious trouble.
<es>

@1368
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Still, I can't believe Mei-sensei got so emotional like that. I think it's the first time I've seen it."
<es>

@1369
<en>{Haruka}\n"Same here."
<es>

@1374
<en>{Yagami}\n"That shows just how much you made Ibuki-sensei worry. Hurry on after her and go apologize."
<es>

@1378
<en>{Pierre}\n"Be sure to prostrate yourself. Throw yourself on the ground."
<es>

@1379
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A-alright. I'll be back."
<es>

@1382
<en>I decided to ready myself for another slap or two. I rushed off as fast as I could after Mei-sensei.
<es>

@1390
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wow... Mei-chan and Harucchi. Who knew?"
<es>

@1391
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? What? Is that how it is?"
<es>

@1392
<en>{Pierre}\n"He said he still hasn't heard an answer from Mei-chan, though. What do you think, Appo-san?"
<es>

@1396
<en>{Appo}\n"What will be, will be. Right, Fuu-tan?"
<es>

@1400
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Yes. It's summer."
<es>

@1408
<en>Sensei was standing alone in the schoolyard. She looked like a lost child with nowhere to go.
<es>

@1409
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei?"
<es>

@1410
<en>When I called her, she turned around in surprise.
<es>

@1413
<en>{Mei}\n"Wah, d-did you follow me?"
<es>

@1414
<en>Sensei turned away and tried to run again.
<es>

@1415
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah, hey! Don't run!"
<es>

@1416
<en>{Mei}\n"Hh... Wh-why are you chasing me?"
<es>

@1417
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course I'd come after you when you dashed off like that."
<es>

@1420
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, I see... I think I might have thought you'd come chasing after me."
<es>

@1421
<en>She muttered, lowering her face. I couldn't see it well in the shadows, but she seemed to blush.
<es>

@1422
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sorry... I slapped you really hard."
<es>

@1423
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, don't worry. It was my fault."
<es>

@1424
<en>That was 100% my fault. I apologized honestly. Then sensei stared at me.
<es>

@1427
<en>{Mei}\n"That's right. You are at fault."
<es>

@1428
<en>Her eyes were set on me, which was pretty intense.
<es>

@1429
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I-I really am very sorry for worrying you."
<es>

@1430
<en>{Mei}\n"You really did. How cruel. You promised me, and yet you broke that promise and went to the sea."
<es>

@1431
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry..."
<es>

@1432
<en>{Mei}\n"I was waiting for you in the library since this morning, yet you never came."
<es>

@1433
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, you were waiting for me?"
<es>

@1434
<en>{Mei}\n"It's not like I wanted to wait! You show up every day on your own, then suddenly you don't? Of course I'd worry! Then they said you were eaten by a shark? I can't believe you..."
<es>

@1435
<en>She had tears in the corner of her eyes, just waiting to spill out.
<es>

@1436
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am so sorry..."
<es>

@1437
<en>When sensei lifted her head, tears dribbled down from her eyes over her smooth cheeks.
<es>

@1440
<en>{Mei}\n"Do you have any idea how much I... how much everyone worried about you? I've never worried this before! I truly thought my heart was going to stop!"
<es>

@1441
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh, umm... I'm sorry!!"
<es>

@1442
<en>All I could do was apologize, so with that thought, I bowed over and over. Sensei's gaze was cold.
<es>

@1446
<en>{Mei}\n"If apologies were all we needed, we wouldn't have the police! You were lucky to escape safely, but if the worst had happened - if that had happened - then what would you have done?!"
<es>

@1448
<en>I'd never seen sensei this enraged. I could tell she was getting more and more agitated as she continued to yell.
<es>

@1451
<en>{Mei}\n"Honestly, you... You idiot!!"
<es>

@1453
<en>*Slap*
<es>

@1454
<en>She hit me again, but lightly this time.
<es>

@1459
<en>{Mei}\n"You stupid, stupid..."
<es>

@1461
<en>*Slap, slap.*
<es>

@1463
<en>Her powerless palms struck my cheeks many times, but it only felt like she was stroking them. Still, the weight behind that hand reached my heart.
<es>

@1464
<en>But I was also happy, since it felt like the first time she truly connected with me.
<es>

@1465
<en>Sensei was always nice and friendly with us, but this was the first time she'd ever opened up this much to any of us.
<es>

@1466
<en>The reason it hurt me so deeply in my heart each time she hit me was because sensei had opened up that much to me.
<es>

@1467
<en>Sensei looked down, frowning and on the verge of tears.
<es>

@1470
<en>{Mei}\n"............ Don't you ever make me wait again. If you say you love me, then don't make me worry about you like this."
<es>

@1471
<en>{Mei}\n"From now on, you're to come see me every morning for the rest of summer break. Don't go anywhere on your own without telling me."
<es>

@1472
<en>Sensei pleaded in a low voice, sniffing several times as her shoulders heaved with each and every breath. I was touched by how desperate her pleas were.
<es>

@1473
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I understand. I'll never make you wait again. I'll come and see you every day."
<es>

@1476
<en>{Mei}\n"You mean it? Then promise me."
<es>

@1477
<en>Sensei held out her pinky - her gemstone-like pinky. This time, I didn't make her wait and wrapped my pinky around hers.
<es>

@1478
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will never make you wait again. And I'll never make you cry again."
<es>

@1481
<en>{Mei}\n"If you break your promise, you'll be in serious trouble."
<es>

@1482
<en>Sensei leaned her head against my chest. After hesitating, I put my hands on her shoulders and gently hugged her close.
<es>

@1483
<en>Wow, I really like this atmosphere.
<es>

@1484
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei..."

<en>Our pinkies were still entwined. We pulled them apart and held each other's hand. Her hand felt very warm to me.
<es>

@1486
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh... Sensei, your palm's bright red."
<es>

@1489
<en>{Mei}\n"Because I hit you hard with it. It hurts."
<es>

@1490
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see..."
<es>

@1491
<en>It hurt me, but it also hurt her. Perhaps sensei hurt more...
<es>

@1492
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@1493
<en>I wrapped her hand and held it in mine.
<es>

@1496
<en>{Mei}\n"It really did hurt. Don't make me hit you ever again, okay?"
<es>

@1497
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I won't."
<es>

@1500
<en>I softly rubbed her hand in my palms. Then, sensei stared at me.
<es>

@1501
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei......"
<es>

@1502
<en>Our faces were close. If I brought mine just a little closer, our lips might touch......
<es>

@1503
<en>{Kazushi}\n"..............."
<es>

@1510
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wow, it's true."
<es>

@1511
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh...?"
<es>

@1519
<en>I felt something suspicious and stopped. When I turned around, I saw my classmates hiding behind things and peeping on us with curiosity.
<es>

@1525
<en>{Mei}\n"Hey, you guys..."
<es>

@1533
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, what was that for, Sakura? They found us because you had to say something."
<es>

@1536
<en>{Sakura}\n"Sorry. But it's such a shock."
<es>

@1537
<en>{Pierre}\n"They were almost about to kiss each other. Maybe even go further than that..."
<es>

@1541
<en>{Haruka}\n"Huh? What do you mean by further?"
<es>

@1547
<en>{Mei}\n"Wh-what are you talking about, guys? We are not what you .........Oh."
<es>

@1550
<en>She finally realized we were hugging each other and quickly pulled away from me. I thought it was a little too late, though.
<es>

@1551
<en>Everyone looked like they'd already watched enough to satisfy themselves.
<es>

@1554
<en>{Mei}\n"Were you guys watching us...... this whole time?"
<es>

@1559
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well, Kazushi and Mei-sensei, you know? Way to go Kazushi. It's nice to see you make it this far despite not knowing your place."
<es>

@1560
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Should I take that as a compliment?"
<es>

@1561
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You should, you should. I don't mind stupid guys."
<es>

@1565
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi-kun and Mei-chan, huh? Who'd have thought it'd turn out like this..."
<es>

@1569
<en>{Rin}\n"Uh, umm... are you two actually going out?"
<es>

@1573
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hey, tell us how you two fell in love! Mei-chan, what attracted you to Harucchi?"
<es>

@1580
<en>{Mei}\n"What you ask... Umm, but look... we're not really dating..."
<es>

@1587
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Don't be shy about it. There's nothing to be ashamed of about falling in love with someone."
<es>

@1588
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whoa, that's a good line, Fuusen."
<es>

@1591
<en>{Mei}\n"That's not it, it's different? We're student and teacher? We can't..."
<es>

@1598
<en>{Appo}\n"I'm glad to see you two following suit after us! All you others should follow our lead, too!"
<es>

@1601
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Oh, how embarrassing."
<es>

@1606
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm telling you it's not like that! Ahhh, jeez! Kazushi-kun, say something!"
<es>

@1607
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, it's not wrong for me. I love you, sensei."
<es>

@1610
<en>{Mei}\n"Ah............"
<es>

@1611
<en>Sensei blushed and fell silent. Everyone started carrying on more about that.
<es>

@1612
<en>{Mei}\n"Ooh, sheesh..."
<es>

@1613
<en>I liked seeing sensei look troubled too, so I kept watching for a while.
<es>

@1621
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All done!"
<es>

@1622
<en>I counted a bundle of report papers. Exactly ten sheets.
<es>

@1625
<en>{Appo}\n"You finished that 10 page repentance report already? Did you actually write it?"
<es>

@1626
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I finished it perfectly. I'll go hand it in right away!"
<es>

@1631
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Excuse me........ Oh?"
<es>

@1632
<en>I stepped back as I was about to open the door when I heard people talking in the quiet room. It was Mei-sensei and Yagami-sensei.
<es>

@1640
<en>{Mei}\n"Thank you for everything."
<es>

@1643
<en>{Yagami}\n"No, no, don't mention it."
<es>

@1644
<en>Their voices quietly echoed like waves in the calm afternoon faculty room. I found myself standing there eavesdropping.
<es>

@1647
<en>{Yagami}\n"Still, I'm surprised. I never expected you to raise your hand against a student."
<es>

@1650
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm surprised too. It was the first time I've ever gotten mad like that."
<es>

@1651
<en>She looked at the palm which slapped my face. I felt like my cheek was stinging again.
<es>

@1652
<en>{Mei}\n"I can't believe I slapped my own student."
<es>

@1655
<en>{Yagami}\n"You can't protest against corporal punishment anymore, can you? Ahahaha."
<es>

@1656
<en>Yagami-sensei was laughing, but Mei-sensei hung her head, looking cornered.
<es>

@1659
<en>{Mei}\n"I had already slapped him before I realized it. I wasn't thinking straight then. This has never happened before."
<es>

@1662
<en>{Yagami}\n"I guess that means you were that serious? I think it's better to have times when you're so serious you lose control."
<es>

@1665
<en>{Mei}\n"Doesn't that disqualify you as a teacher? Isn't it a teacher's duty to maintain their calm at all times and lead their students down the right path?"
<es>

@1666
<en>I'm sure that's what she's believed until now. If you ask me, I'd say that's the kind of teacher she is.
<es>

@1668
<en>{Yagami}\n"Yes, up until today you have been an exemplary teacher, but you also gave the impression that you were just mechanically following the rules. I wasn't particularly fond of that aspect."
<es>

@1672
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, so you did dislike me like I thought? I had a feeling you did."
<es>

@1673
<en>Yagami-sensei disliked Mei-sensei? But now they were smiling naturally. They're both good looking, too - it's making me kind of jealous.
<es>

@1676
<en>{Yagami}\n"But I liked it when you slapped Kazushi today because I could tell that you really were thinking of him from your heart."
<es>

@1677
<en>Yagami-sensei gave her a broad smile. It was such a nice smile, even a guy like me could fall for it.
<es>

@1680
<en>{Yagami}\n"I'm glad that you thought of Kazushi that much. Well, I suppose I can't praise your motive behind it very much, though..."
<es>

@1683
<en>Mei-sensei blushed when she realized what he meant. I felt myself blushing too.
<es>

@1686
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm not qualified as a teacher, am I? I can't bear special feelings towards just one of my students."
<es>

@1687
<en>Huh...? Just one student? Does she mean me? Then Mei-sensei actually...?
<es>

@1690
<en>{Yagami}\n"True, it's not something to be praised, but I don't think it's a matter to worry yourself over that much either."
<es>

@1693
<en>{Yagami}\n"Even if you are teacher and student, you're still a man and a woman. What will be will be."
<es>

@1696
<en>{Mei}\n"Is that how it goes?"
<es>

@1699
<en>{Yagami}\n"Well, yeah. There are loves that can never come to fruition, and there are also times when one winds up tied to a partner one never imagined."
<es>

@1701
<en>{Yagami}\n"There's a girl you never paid any attention to before yesterday, and suddenly you can't get her off your mind and it drives you crazy. Things like that are beyond our control."
<es>

@1705
<en>{Yagami}\n"Truly, it's something God only knows. There's nothing that we can do about it, after all."
<es>

@1708
<en>{Mei}\n"Is that coming from experience? Did you have such a romance with your wife, Yagami-sensei?"
<es>

@1711
<en>{Yagami}\n"Ahaha, ours was a shotgun wedding. It really was by God's grace."
<es>

@1714
<en>{Mei}\n"God..."
<es>

@1715
<en>God, huh? I've never believed in God, but I wouldn't mind believing in him if it brought me together with Mei-sensei.
<es>

@1718
<en>{Yagami}\n"Thinking about what you can do is pointless. You can't make yourself love someone you don't, nor can you bring yourself to hate someone you don't."
<es>

@1721
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, yes, that's true, but..."
<es>

@1722
<en>{Yagami}\n"Sensei, I don't know if you're being strict about this or you're just innocent, but you're not very good at it."
<es>

@1725
<en>{Mei}\n"Do you think so? I don't really know, myself."
<es>

@1728
<en>{Yagami}\n"Yeah, you really suck. I can't believe you picked Kazushi. There are plenty of other, better guys out there."
<es>

@1729
<en>Wh-what are you saying, you bastard! Sensei was finally starting to feel something towards me - don't ruin it!
<es>

@1732
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't know much about men, but is Kazushi-kun bad?"
<es>

@1733
<en>See? You made Mei-sensei worry about it!
<es>

@1736
<en>{Yagami}\n"Oh, no, not really. Well, Kazushi's a nice guy. He is stupid, though."
<es>

@1737
<en>You didn't need to add "Stupid"!
<es>

@1740
<en>{Mei}\n"That's true. Hee-hee..."
<es>

@1741
<en>What? They're both laughing after calling me stupid. That's not funny.
<es>

@1742
<en>{Mei}\n"Hee-hee... that's funny."
<es>

@1743
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm, is it that funny?"
<es>

@1744
<en>She was laughing herself to tears. But well, I guess it's okay as long as sensei's happy. It's far better than making her cry.
<es>

@1749
<en>It was still raining the next day.
<es>

@1753
<en>With the rain outside, the library was filled with languid shadows. As promised, I showed up first thing in the morning, but we just gazed out the window with nothing to do.
<es>

@1755
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It sure is raining. We can't play outside today either."
<es>

@1758
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't even think about fishing."
<es>

@1759
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. I'll never do something like that again."
<es>

@1762
<en>{Mei}\n"But still, it really is coming down."
<es>

@1763
<en>Sensei simply rested her head on her chin as she listlessly gazed outside the window, but she looked good doing so.
<es>

@1764
<en>I was amazed at how satisfied I felt just watching her.
<es>

@1765
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is there anything to be done today?"
<es>

@1766
<en>I wasn't trying to make up for yesterday, but I couldn't sit still and I wanted to do something.
<es>

@1769
<en>{Mei}\n"Are you bored just watching the rain?"
<es>

@1770
<en>She asked, as she gazed out the window.
<es>

@1771
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not really bored. I just have energy to burn."
<es>

@1774
<en>{Mei}\n"Honestly, you young boys are just full of energy. Are you sure you're not bored, falling in love with this old lady?"
<es>

@1775
<en>I thought something was off. It wasn't like her to ask questions that begged for my answer.
<es>

@1776
<en>So I looked at her and spoke clearly.
<es>

@1777
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm happy everyday because I'm in love with somebody."
<es>

@1780
<en>{Mei}\n"...Really?"
<es>

@1781
<en>I could tell she was a bit unsettled.
<es>

@1782
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Before, I used to feel tired in the morning, but now I can't wait to get up because I can see the person I love."
<es>

@1783
<en>{Mei}\n"R-really? Hmm, that so? ......Kazushi-kun, you say some rather amazing things."
<es>

@1784
<en>She continued to look out the window, but I could feel all her attention on me.
<es>

@1785
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not amazing at all. Compared to what I feel every day now, that's nothing."
<es>

@1788
<en>{Mei}\n"Really?"
<es>

@1789
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really."
<es>

@1790
<en>Sensei fell silent under my pressure. She looked sad as she gazed in thought at the pouring rain.
<es>

@1793
<en>{Mei}\n"Love...... is it that great?"
<es>

@1794
<en>She asked, hesitantly, after a period of silence. She slowly turned around and looked at me again.
<es>

@1795
<en>I looked right back at her and gave her a firm nod.
<es>

@1796
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's the greatest. It makes me feel like I'm alive."
<es>

@1799
<en>{Mei}\n"I see... Then what is this feeling I have now? Is it not love?"
<es>

@1800
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Feeling you have now?"
<es>

@1801
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sure I have special feelings towards you, Kazushi-kun, but I just don't know if that's love or not."
<es>

@1802
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What kind of feelings are they?"
<es>

@1803
<en>{Mei}\n"Well... Lately I can hardly sleep..."
<es>

@1804
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah, that's love! No mistake!"
<es>

@1805
<en>Just let it be that way! Or so I thought until Mei glared at me.
<es>

@1808
<en>{Mei}\n"You're just running your mouth because you think I don't know anything, aren't you?"
<es>

@1809
<en>She gave me a sweet glare.\nShe sure is sharp.
<es>

@1810
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, most certainly not... Just, I think love comes in many forms. Has there been anything else?"
<es>

@1813
<en>{Mei}\n"Well... before I realize it, there's someone on my mind sometimes."
<es>

@1814
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I-is that person me?!"
<es>

@1817
<en>{Mei}\n"That's... a secret."
<es>

@1818
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't answer you if it's a secret."
<es>

@1819
<en>But judging from context, it is me, right? No, has anything that good ever happened in my life? Maybe it's someone completely different.
<es>

@1820
<en>If only I was stupider and more simple! Then I would've thought it was me and enjoyed myself! I would've been happier that way!
<es>

@1821
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Argh..."
<es>

@1824
<en>{Mei}\n"Huh? Why are you holding your head? Are you alright?"
<es>

@1825
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm just sick and tired of my high IQ. I'd be so much happier if I was stupid!"
<es>

@1828
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't think your IQ is that high, Kazushi-kun?"
<es>

@1829
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think it's higher than Appo and Daigo's. Argh, I'm so jealous of them!"
<es>

@1830
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, Pierre looks dumb, but he might actually have a pretty good IQ. He's from Yokohama."
<es>

@1833
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't think birthplace has anything to do with IQ. Kazushi-kun, I'm not sure you understand what IQ means..."
<es>

@1834
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Anyways, it's bad to think too much. Often times your gut feelings are right."
<es>

@1837
<en>{Mei}\n"My gut feelings..."
<es>

@1839
<en>Sensei looked back out the window again. The fierce rain pounded against the glass.
<es>

@1842
<en>{Mei}\n"Hey, Kazushi-kun."
<es>

@1843
<en>Sensei slowly turned to me.
<es>

@1844
<en>{Mei}\n"Is love that great? Is love that wonderful?"
<es>

@1845
<en>What a childish question. My answer was obvious.
<es>

@1846
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course. Love is a many splendored thing."
<es>

@1849
<en>{Mei}\n"Do you enjoy every day when you're in love? Will I start looking forward to waking up tomorrow, too?"
<es>

@1850
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You will. I'm positive."
<es>

@1851
<en>{Mei}\n"If you never loved someone, how much do think you'd be missing out on life?"
<es>

@1852
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's see... I'd be missing out on 70 - no, 80%."
<es>

@1855
<en>{Mei}\n"Then love is..."
<es>

@1856
<en>Sensei kept firing questions away at me. But no matter how many I answered, they kept coming.
<es>

@1857
<en>Even if I answered all those questions and explained it, could she even understand love?
<es>

@1860
<en>{Mei}\n"Then... then..."
<es>

@1861
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei."
<es>

@1862
<en>I raised my hand and stopped her from saying anything. Then I opened the window holding off against the storm.
<es>

@1866
<en>Fierce winds and rain blew inside.
<es>

@1869
<en>{Mei}\n"Hey, Kazushi-kun?!"
<es>

@1870
<en>I ignored sensei and placed my hand on the windowsill.
<es>

@1871
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haa!!"
<es>

@1872
<en>In one fell swoop, I leapt out the window.
<es>

@1875
<en>{Mei}\n"K-Kazushi-kun?!"
<es>

@1876
<en>My body flew through the air, falling. I didn't feel a shred of fear, merely the exhilaration of flying.
<es>

@1881
<en>I rode the strong winds against my body, and landed on the muddy ground. Muddy water flew up from the impact.
<es>

@1882
<en>I only jumped from the second floor, but by this point I was already soaked and covered in mud.
<es>

@1883
<en>{Mei}\n"Hey, Kazushi-kun?! What are you doing?! You'll get wet, so hurry back inside!!"
<es>

@1884
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Too late! I'm already soaked!"
<es>

@1885
<en>My wet clothes stuck to my skin. They were already far too wet to care. It felt great to be wet.
<es>

@1886
<en>{Mei}\n"It's still storming outside! Besides, how could you jump from up here?! Why would you do something so stupid?!"
<es>

@1887
<en>{Kazushi}\n"When you're in love, you become stupid! See? Like this...!"
<es>

@1889
<en>I dived right into a puddle of mud. I made a big splash and slid through it.
<es>

@1890
<en>{Mei}\n"Kyah?! Wh-what are you doing! Stop being such an idiot!"
<es>

@1891
<en>Mei screamed. I felt kind of good to make sensei so flustered.
<es>

@1893
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This feels pretty good! Yaaaaaah!"
<es>

@1894
<en>I dove in one more time. This time, I slid head first.
<es>

@1895
<en>There was mud in my clothes and even my underwear, but nothing really mattered anymore.
<es>

@1896
<en>{Mei}\n"Ahh, you're covered in mud... I wonder if the bath is ready?"
<es>

@1897
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei, have you ever done this before?"
<es>

@1898
<en>I asked her as I slid across the mud.
<es>

@1899
<en>{Mei}\n"Of course I haven't! What's the meaning in doing something like that?!"
<es>

@1900
<en>Sensei shouted, on the verge of tears.
<es>

@1901
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There is no meaning! When you're in love, you're just filled with energy and you want to run around screaming and going wild!"
<es>

@1903
<en>I dived again as I spoke. I couldn't see anything through the mud splashes.
<es>

@1904
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uwah, Ptt, ptt, ptt! I got mud in my mouth!"
<es>

@1905
<en>{Mei}\n"Aww, sheesh! It's because you did that while talking."
<es>

@1907
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Butterfly!! Ahahahahaha!"
<es>

@1908
<en>{Mei}\n"Sheesh! What are you laughing about? What's so fun?"
<es>

@1909
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know! I don't know, but I'm having fun!"
<es>

@1911
<en>I swam through mud puddles, kicking them up. I thought I was an idiot too, but it was so much fun.
<es>

@1912
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei, give it a try!"
<es>

@1913
<en>{Mei}\n"I-I can't do that. It'll be terrible later if I get covered in mud."
<es>

@1914
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're not doing it right if you think ahead! You can't love someone like that!"
<es>

@1915
<en>{Mei}\n"Grr..."
<es>

@1916
<en>Sensei looked down and pinned her eyes on me.
<es>

@1917
<en>{Mei}\n"F-fine then. I'll try it."
<es>

@1918
<en>Sensei put her hand on the windowsill like I did. Huh? Is she gonna jump?
<es>

@1919
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait, sensei, you can't!! Use the stairs..."
<es>

@1920
<en>{Mei}\n"Ei!!"
<es>

@1921
<en>She closed her eyes and leapt.
<es>

@1922
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you closing your eyes for?!!"
<es>

@1923
<en>I kicked up mud as I dashed towards sensei.
<es>

@1924
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hraaaaah!!"
<es>

@1928
<en>{Mei}\n"Kyah?!"
<es>

@1933
<en>I made a sliding catch as sensei fell to the ground in a dangerous position. I slid about three meters with her in my arms before we stopped.
<es>

@1934
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whew, that was close. What are you doing?!"
<es>

@1937
<en>Mei was stunned in my arms.
<es>

@1938
<en>{Mei}\n"That was scary..."
<es>

@1939
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Scary? Don't you know what'll happen if you close your eyes and jump out of a second story window?"
<es>

@1942
<en>{Mei}\n"I wasn't thinking ahead."
<es>

@1943
<en>She pursed her lips as she spoke proudly. Then she smiled as she looked me and herself.
<es>

@1944
<en>{Mei}\n"Hahaha, all muddy..."
<es>

@1945
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Seriously. Your face looks terrible."
<es>

@1948
<en>OOF!
<es>

@1949
<en>{Kazushi}\n"YUCK!"
<es>

@1950
<en>She threw mud at me.
<es>

@1951
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ptt, ptt, ptt! What was that for?!"
<es>

@1954
<en>{Mei}\n"How terrible of you, to tell a girl her face looks terrible!"
<es>

@1955
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't mean it that way. I meant your face was terribly covered in mud."
<es>

@1958
<en>{Mei}\n"Ah, you said it again."
<es>

@1959
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wahh, hey, hold on! Not the mud!"
<es>

@1960
<en>I wiped the mud off her pouting face with my palm. Sensei behaved and let me do it.
<es>

@1963
<en>This felt kind of nice. I saw a slight smile...
<es>

@1964
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei, are you smiling?"
<es>

@1965
<en>{Mei}\n"Heh, heh, yeah, I think I'm having fun now."
<es>

@1966
<en>She was covered in mud. Her clothes and probably her underwear were soaked, and sensei smiled like I'd never seen her before.
<es>

@1967
<en>{Mei}\n"I really am stupid, covered in all this mud. But it's kind of fun. I wonder if this is what love feels like?"
<es>

@1968
<en>She looked up at me and mumbled that.
<es>

@1971
<en>{Mei}\n"But... I really don't know what being in love feels like."
<es>

@1972
<en>She looked down and wore a lonely smile. However, she soon raised her head and grinned at me.
<es>

@1976
<en>{Mei}\n"So, Kazushi-kun, teach me about love."
<es>

@1977
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh... me?"
<es>

@1978
<en>Sensei looked up at me and nodded. She looked at me with our noses almost touching, and my heart began pounding.
<es>

@1980
<en>At that moment, I held the woman I loved again my chest. Still, thinking about it calmly, it was such a big deal I could have fainted, but this woman asked me to teach her about love.
<es>

@1982
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure you're alright with me filling that role?"
<es>

@1983
<en>My cowardly mind made me ask again.
<es>

@1986
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes. I want you, Kazushi-kun. I can't think of anyone but you anymore. I want you to teach me, Kazushi-kun."
<es>

@1987
<en>Sensei clung to my chest and repeated herself clearly. Then my cowardly self made its resolve.
<es>

@1988
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I understand. I'll make sure to teach you the wonderfulness of being in love."
<es>

@1989
<en>Well, I sure talked big, but I'd only known one-sided love myself...
<es>

@1990
<en>Well, it'll work out. Our summer's just begun. We have plenty of time to spend...
<es>

@1991
<en>{Mei}\n"Then what do we do first?"
<es>

@1992
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh...? First?"
<es>

@1993
<en>I wasn't expecting her to ask right now. I had absolutely no plan.
<es>

@1996
<en>{Mei}\n"If you're in love, what's the first thing you do?"
<es>

@1997
<en>Her innocent eyes shone with curiosity. I couldn't pluck the buds of intellectual curiosity sprouting inside sensei. The first step for lovers is...
<es>

@1998
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A-a kiss! They kiss!"
<es>

@2001
<en>{Mei}\n"Huh, kiss? ......we're going to kiss?"
<es>

@2002
<en>{Kazushi}\n"W-we are! Is that okay?!"
<es>

@2003
<en>{Mei}\n"Y-yes... go ahead..."
<es>

@2005
<en>Mei hesitantly closed her eyes. She was completely different from her usual, confident self. Was her body trembling because of the storm?
<es>

@2006
<en>{Kazushi}\n"H-here I go."
<es>

@2007
<en>{Mei}\n"........."
<es>

@2008
<en>Sensei raised her chin and held still. I brought my mouth near her glossy lips. At that moment, even I closed my eyes.
<es>

@2009
<en>{Mei}\n"Mmm..."
<es>

@2010
<en>I felt the soft, yet firm touch of her plump lips. I felt like my brain would melt when my lips touched hers.
<es>

@2011
<en>{Mei}\n"Mmm... mmmhah..."
<es>

@2012
<en>Her breath was sweet. Well, I couldn't actually notice that since I couldn't even tell how long we held our lips together.
<es>

@2013
<en>At some point we had to breathe, and they finally parted.
<es>

@2014
<en>{Mei}\n"Ahh...... mmm..."
<es>

@2015
<en>Sensei slowly opened her eyes, and looked up at me with a dizzy gaze.
<es>

@2016
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How was it?"
<es>

@2017
<en>{Mei}\n"Umm... it tasted like mud."
<es>

@2018
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see..."
<es>

@2019
<en>Our first kiss tasted like mud, huh? Not romantic at all.
<es>

@2020
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry. I'll do better next time!"
<es>

@2021
<en>I apologized without thinking. Sensei chuckled.
<es>

@2022
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, please do."
<es>

@2023
<en>My head grew light at her smile. I said I'd teach her about love, but I think I'm the one falling deeper and deeper...
<es>
