<en>{Mei}\n"I may be Udon noodle."
<es>

@10
<en>Ms.Mei said so when she saw the shiny Udon noodle that she was eating, but I have no idea what she meant.
<es>

@11
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What riddle is it?"
<es>

@14
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't you think so?"
<es>

@15
<en>She asked me seriously. It doesn't seem a joke....
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think so."
<es>

@19
<en>{Mei}\n"Really? How about Hollunkulus?"
<es>

@20
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hollunkulus?"
<es>

@21
<en>I never heard the word beofe, but it sounds familiar....
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you talking about the cow's breed?"
<es>

@25
<en>{Mei}\n".........Hollnsteine"
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, not that one."
<es>

@29
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't you remember that? You're kidding me!"
<es>

@30
<en>She was amazed that I didn't know the word. Is everybody supposed to know that?
<es>

@31
<en>{Mei}\n"You really don't remember it, do you? I didn't teach you well, I guess."
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean by teach? Did you cover that at the class?"
<es>

@35
<en>{Mei}\n"I guess you have no idea. When second semester starts, I'll give you a strict dicipline."
<es>

@36
<en>I wish the summer holiday would continue forever.
<es>

@39
<en>{Mei}\n"By the way, the thing in yesterday...."
<es>

@40
<en>All of a sudden, she speaks in a lower voice.
<es>

@41
<en>When she said the word "yesterday", the principal's face came on my mind first than Ms.Mei's sleeping face, which made me angry.
<es>

@42
<en>{Mei}\n"When did I fall asleep last night?"
<es>

@43
<en>She askes me in a quiet voice. This is the conversation only between us.
<es>

@44
<en>The angry feeling that I had gets easier.
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, that was before four o'clock. You went to sleep while we were talking."
<es>

@48
<en>{Mei}\n"Did I sleep in front of you, Kazushi?"
<es>

@49
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, you did. Don't you remember it at all?"
<es>

@52
<en>{Mei}\n"No, I don't. I remember that I was tired."
<es>

@53
<en>She lowers her eyes embarrassingly, then looks at me in upward glance.
<es>

@56
<en>{Mei}\n"Did you stay in my room all night?"
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I moved you to the bed and went home soon."
<es>

@60
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, you carried me to the bed, too."
<es>

@61
<en>She blushes her cheeks. It's very rare for Ms.Mei to feel embarrassed llike that.
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You were sleeping with your face on the table, so I carried you as a princess....."
<es>

@65
<en>{Mei}\n"Owwwwiiiiuuuu..."
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@67
<en>Wha-what was the weird sound? Did it come from Ms.Mei?
<es>

@70
<en>{Mei}\n"Sorry for my unguarded behavior in front of my student....I don't know why I was so careless, then."
<es>

@71
<en>She holds her head in her hands. I would say when Ms.Mei holding her head in her hands is worth to watch.
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um...I'm not your student now. Maybe, that's why."
<es>

@75
<en>{Mei}\n"I know that was a deal, but.....Anyway, did you see my sleeping face?"
<es>

@76
<en>She asks me hesitantly.
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, I did. It was so cute...."
<es>

@80
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, gush...."
<es>

@81
<en>She holds her head in her hands again. Is she a real Mei Ibuki?
<es>

@84
<en>{Mei}\n"I had no make-up, which is so embarrassing to me, plus, you saw my sleeping face."
<es>

@85
<en>She mumbles something complainingly.
<es>

@88
<en>{Mei}\n"I can't bellieve it. It must be a superstition."
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, it really happened yesterday."
<es>

@92
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, usually, I can't sleep when somebody is around me. That's why I don't understand why I could sleep yesterday.....It could be a sleeping pill."
<es>

@93
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no, no. Don't even go there."
<es>

@96
<en>{Mei}\n"I mean you could be my sleeping pill or a tranquilizer. Oh, that's silly."
<es>

@97
<en>She is talking embarrassingly. I can see she is a little confused.
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Take it easy, Ms.Mei."
<es>

@101
<en>{Mei}\n"Wha? Oh, I am. I got to eat the steamed rice. Otherwise, I would be only a chunk of flesh."
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're eating now."
<es>

@105
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, I may be Udon noodle."
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whatever it is, you got to breathe deeply first."
<es>

@109
<en>{Mei}\n"Phhhh.........Haa.........."
<es>

@117
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh? I didn't know you were here."
<es>

@118
<en>The three of them came here teasingly.
<es>

@124
<en>{Mei}\n"Hey, guys, how are you doing?"
<es>

@125
<en>They didn't say anything to us, but Ms.Mei sits up straight covering the loophole.
<es>

@129
<en>{Daigo}\n"You were in the library in whole morning, didn't you, Kazushi?"
<es>

@130
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, sort of. I'm so tired now."
<es>

@131
<en>I went back to my room before around five o'clock last night, and I got up before eight this morning, that means I slept less than three hours.
<es>

@136
<en>{Appo-}\n"You must be sleepy because you came home with the milk. TEE HEE..."
<es>

@140
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, my God!"
<es>

@141
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How did you know about that?"
<es>

@144
<en>{Appo-}\n"It's easy to find out because we share the room. When I woke up at night, you were not there, then I saw you came back in the early morning."
<es>

@148
<en>{Pierre}\n"Are you serious? That means...."
<es>

@155
<en>{Daigo}\n"Hey, Kazushi, you are finally......"
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no, it's wrong. That's not what you're thinking."
<es>

@162
<en>{Mei}\n"Nothing happened, really."
<es>

@163
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's right! Nothing happened....."
<es>

@171
<en>Three of them stare at us coldly while we are making an excuse. More we become mad, colder they become.
<es>

@174
<en>{Pierre}\n"Ahh...I see...You guys were together last night, weren't you?"
<es>

@175
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, shit!"
<es>

@178
<en>{Appo-}\n"Um...I was half joking, but it turned into a lucky guess."
<es>

@184
<en>{Mei}\n"Um...Uhh....Well...Oh, yeah. I was helping his research...."
<es>

@189
<en>{Pierre}\n"Private lesson until the morning? How lucky you are, Kazushi. But you still pay the same tuition as we do, right?"
<es>

@190
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Come on, guys. Cut it out! Nothing really happened, I'm telling you."
<es>

@198
<en>I stare at them to tell them how serious I am. They started whispering after receiving my telepathy.
<es>

@201
<en>{Daigo}\n"Well, I guess you're telling the truth."
<es>

@204
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh, thank God! It could be possible to stay until the morning, but are you sure nothing really happened?"
<es>

@207
<en>{Appo-}\n"It's unbelievable, Miss. Why are men always like that? I'm sure she must've had certain anticipation."
<es>

@213
<en>{Mei}\n"What? She means me? Oh, no. I had no anticipation at all."
<es>

@214
<en>I know she didn't because she was deep asleep.
<es>

@215
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, well...anyway, finish this up."
<es>

@223
<en>{Appo-}\n"Ohh...I'd better let you go."
<es>

@226
<en>{Pierre}\n"I know they have their own pace. He is good-for-nothing, but I hope you enjoy him, Mei."
<es>

@232
<en>{Mei}\n"Wha? I am telling you this...."
<es>

@237
<en>{Appo-}\n"We're saying he is stupid and unreliable, so you'd better lead him. that's all."
<es>

@240
<en>{Mei}\n"We are not what you think........"
<es>

@244
<en>{Daigo}\n"Ms.Mei, your face turns red."
<es>

@245
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, come on, guys! Don't tease your teacher."
<es>

@246
<en>Despite how mad she is, they are just grinning at her.
<es>

@247
<en>It can't be helped. Ms.Mei turning her face red looks incredibly cute.
<es>

@254
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, yeah!"
<es>

@255
<en>Ms.Mei came to stop on the way to the library.
<es>

@256
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@259
<en>{Mei}\n"I forgot to go shopping, so I'll do it now."
<es>

@260
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, I'll go with you!"
<es>

@265
<en>The town looks very fresh walking along with Ms.Mei.
<es>

@266
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I feel we are dating now."
<es>

@269
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't go further."
<es>

@270
<en>Ms.Mei, being herself again gets a stake firmly. But, I like her when she felt intimidated, too.
<es>

@271
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what do you need here?"
<es>

@274
<en>{Mei}\n"I need stuff for the class. A great idea came up on me, so I wanted to perform experiment during the summer holiday."
<es>

@275
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The tool for alchemy? I know which store we have to stop by."
<es>

@280
<en>{Mei}\n"Hello~"
<es>

@281
<en>Ms.Mei greeted friendly, which tells you she 's been here many times.
<es>

@286
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Oh, Mei. Come on in. How are you doing?"
<es>

@287
<en>The clerk comes out from the inside. I think his name is Miya.
<es>

@288
<en>Miya looks really happy to see Ms.Mei.
<es>

@291
<en>{Mei}\n"It's been while to see you, Miya. I was very busy with the co-ed department."
<es>

@294
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I can imagine. I know you are not used to deal with boys in younger age."
<es>

@297
<en>{Mei}\n"Everything is new to me."
<es>

@298
<en>I feel the certain distance between them by listening to their conversation, but they are still friendly. They may be much closer than I think.
<es>

@301
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Oh, you are...."
<es>

@302
<en>I guess he remembered my face even I visited here once.
<es>

@303
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My name is Kazushi. Good to see you."
<es>

@304
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Oh, I remember. You are Kazushi Haruma, right?"
<es>

@305
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes."
<es>

@308
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, I didn't know you guys had met before."
<es>

@309
<en>Ms.Mei looks happy, somehow.
<es>

@310
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"It's a small island as you know. There use to be only girls here, and I had nothing to talk about with them, but now, we have boys...I like that."
<es>

@313
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, you don't like girls, do you?"
<es>

@314
<en>She asked him teasingly. Then, Miya laughs bitterly.
<es>

@317
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"The old man like me feels overwhelming by girl's power."
<es>

@320
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, I don't think you are the old man."
<es>

@321
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Oh, yeah...I have back problem these days."
<es>

@324
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, no, it sounds really old."
<es>

@325
<en>They talk very friendly. They must have a close relationship.
<es>

@326
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I remember you live here for long time, right?"
<es>

@327
<en>I thought if that is the case, Ms.Mei would be a student then. That means he may know her young days.
<es>

@330
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Yeah, I live here for more than ten years."
<es>

@333
<en>{Mei}\n"Despite his appearance, he used to be a talented alchemist, whom the principal invited to this island."
<es>

@334
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this true story?"
<es>

@335
<en>I remember Haruka mentioned that before, even Miya denies it.
<es>

@336
<en>I thought she was joking because he didn't look like that. He looks more a midiocre middle-aged man who lost his job because of restructuring.
<es>

@339
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Oh, c'mon, Mei! Kazushi will believe what you said."
<es>

@340
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Is it not true?"
<es>

@343
<en>{Mei}\n"Well? I don't think I'm lying."
<es>

@346
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Oh, yes, you're a big liar. Actually, I did a little bit alchemy when I was young, but I found I had no talent for it, so I cut my ties with it."
<es>

@347
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@348
<en>Maybe, he's just humbling himself, otherwise, the story is totally different from Ms. Mei's. She is just smiling without interruption.
<es>

@351
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"You know that I had to make a living, so I opened this shop to survive. I don't have the talent much, but this is all I could do."
<es>

@352
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see..."
<es>

@353
<en>I understood what he wanted to say. To make a long story short, he has knowledge about the alchemy, but doesn't have much talent in it.
<es>

@354
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, then, you know the principal, don't you?"
<es>

@355
<en>I remember this moring that the principal warned me not to get involve into Ms.Mei.
<es>

@358
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Of course! Who doesn't if you work in the field of alchemy in this island? I know her for twenty years since I came here."
<es>

@359
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@360
<en>This man might know something about Ms.Mei, treating her like a daughter, and knowing the principal for years.....
<es>

@364
<en>{Mei}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@365
<en>When I get thoughtful, Ms.Mei looks into my face anxiously. I concern about what the principal said, but I can't ask it in front of Ms. Mei.
<es>

@366
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nothing. Well, what about your shopping?"
<es>

@369
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, I almost forgot about it. Can I take a look inside?"
<es>

@374
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Go ahead!"
<es>

@378
<en>Ms.Mei walks toward the far end.
<es>

@381
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"It's very rare you bring your student here, Mei."
<es>

@382
<en>He gave me a long look.
<es>

@383
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this an unusual site for you? Ms.Mei is very popular teacher at school, so I bet students are all over her. she give an impression of"
<es>

@386
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"It's only for the public. The alchemist is basically secretive and they don't want to show their cards."
<es>

@387
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that right?"
<es>

@388
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I wonder what changed her mind."
<es>

@393
<en>{Mei}\n"Excuse me, sir. Don't give him a bad idea."
<es>

@394
<en>I guess she heard Miya, she kept glaring at us. And Miya shrugs his shoulders humorously.
<es>

@397
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I just said what I thought."
<es>

@400
<en>{Mei}\n"I haven't changed my mind at all. I thought it would be a great idea to get boy's opinion from Kazushi......"
<es>

@403
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I think that is the motivation which changed your mind."
<es>

@406
<en>{Mei}\n"Because I never taught boys before, so I learn a lot from him."
<es>

@407
<en>Ms.Mei makes sulky face. Does she do that because she wanna show emotional dependency to him as an adult?
<es>

@410
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"But I still think you must have a reason why you chose Kazushi. As an alchemist, you should count on your intuition."
<es>

@411
<en>{Mei}\n"Intuition....it's not that big deal. Well, I don't know how to explain to him...."
<es>

@412
<en>Ms.Mei became quiet giving up arguing with Miya. And Miya's eyes turn into a gentle fathery look.
<es>

@415
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I think it's enough to tease her."
<es>

@418
<en>{Mei}\n"Jesus Christ! How mean you are!"
<es>

@419
<en>Her pouty face looks cute and Miya also keeps looking at Ms.Mei with a gentle smile on his face.
<es>

@420
<en>It is heartwarming scene as if....
<es>

@421
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You guys look like father and daughter."
<es>

@422
<en>I think this is how father and daughter are supposed to be. When I said my thought, Ms.Mei was very surprised, but Miya was smiling softly.
<es>

@425
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"That's right. I feel Mei is like my daughter."
<es>

@426
<en>The smile he showed was exact fathery smile to a daughter that burned into my mind.
<es>

@427
<en>I wonder if he has a family. He could have a few daughters.
<es>

@428
<en>Well, I'm not close enough to ask him about it, so I just let it go.
<es>

@435
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"You bought a lot, didn't you? Can you carry all of them?"
<es>

@436
<en>{Mei}\n"I hope so....Here I am..."
<es>

@437
<en>She tries to carry one of them, but she wobbles with it, looking too weak to carry.
<es>

@438
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry about that, Ms.Mei. I can carry all of them by myself."
<es>

@439
<en>When I tried to reach over the stuff, she pulled the parcel back toward her.
<es>

@442
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm fine with this. Let's do half and falf."
<es>

@443
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay, you carry this little one, and I carry the rest of it."
<es>

@446
<en>{Mei}\n"What a cockiness you got!"
<es>

@449
<en>I took the parcels from her forcefully, then she pouted. Miya laughed at us loudly.
<es>

@450
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Ha-Ha-Ha...You look a good combination each other. Mei may need the guy like Kazushi. Don't you think so?"
<es>

@451
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I think so. Because....Ms.Mei..."
<es>

@454
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't get carry away. Let's get going."
<es>

@455
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure."
<es>

@456
<en>When I picked them up, I remembered something.
<es>

@457
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah! You can go ahead first."
<es>

@459
<en>I put down the parcels first. I had something to ask Miya when she was not around.
<es>

@462
<en>{Mei}\n"What?"
<es>

@463
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I have something to talk with him as a man."
<es>

@466
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Me?"
<es>

@467
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you mind?"
<es>

@468
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Oh, no, not at all, but..."
<es>

@469
<en>He worries about Ms.Mei.
<es>

@472
<en>{Mei}\n"Then, I wait for you outside. Hurry up, please."
<es>

@480
<en>Ms.Mei left. Now, we are alone.
<es>

@481
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"What is it? Is it abouat Mei?"
<es>

@482
<en>How quick he is. He may not be a just mediocre middle-aged man.
<es>

@483
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You said you knew the principal well, didn't you?"
<es>

@484
<en>I remember that the principal warned me not to get involve in Ms.Mei last night, and that's what I want to know about.
<es>

@485
<en>I am thinking if he treats Ms.Mei like a daughter, plus he knows the rpincipal well, he may give me some good information that I need.
<es>

@486
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Is something wrong with Hisae?"
<es>

@488
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, actually....."
<es>

@489
<en>I told everything to Miya about this moring. The thing about not getting involve into Ms. Mei, my feeling to her, and the confession of love.
<es>

@490
<en>He knows many things about our school, but he is still an outsider, so it's kinda easy for me to talk everything.
<es>

@491
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I see, you like Mei."
<es>

@492
<en>Miya mumbled with deep emotions and got thoughtful.
<es>

@493
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um...."
<es>

@496
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"You know Mei lost the memory of her past, don't you?"
<es>

@497
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, she told me."
<es>

@500
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I see, she told you so by herself...."
<es>

@501
<en>He became silent again. I feel gloomy atmosphere. He finally opens his mouth after grunting a few times.
<es>

@504
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I told this before that I feel I am like a father for her. If I am a father for her, then Hisae would be her mother."
<es>

@505
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? The principal?"
<es>

@506
<en>I remember when Ms.Mei calls the principal 'Hisae'. No wonder they looked very friendly.
<es>

@507
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"You may wonder why. But you can think us as the guardian for her after she lost her memory. We are kind of her surrogate parents in this island."
<es>

@508
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Surrogate parents..."
<es>

@509
<en>The relationship between Ms.Mei and Miya is deeper than I thought, besides, the principal is involved in this, too.....
<es>

@510
<en>I wonder what happened in Ms.Mei's past.
<es>

@513
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"That's why I have right to say about your relationship with her. I would say this doesn't look good to me from a different view of Hisae."
<es>

@514
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It doesn't?"
<es>

@515
<en>I was shocked. I was expecting a positive answer from the gengle guy like him.
<es>

@516
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Actually, I haven't got any consent form Ms. Mei yet, before you say okay or not."
<es>

@519
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Hahaha, I thought so. Because I've never seen Mei showed the interest in this stuff before."
<es>

@520
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ms.Mei graduated from this shool, didn't she? You know when she was a student, right?"
<es>

@521
<en>I mean before she lost her memory. If you became a surrogate parent, I'm sure he must've known her. Miya made a grimace and shook his head qietly.
<es>

@524
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Sorry, but I don't know when she was a student."
<es>

@525
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, are you sure?"
<es>

@526
<en>I thought he knew her because you became llike a father for her since then.
<es>

@529
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I think only Hisae knows when Mei was a student."
<es>

@530
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see..."
<es>

@531
<en>Only the principal knows the fact. I feel something fishy after I knew that the principal involved in this. I don't know why.
<es>

@532
<en>I wish I didn't need to feel this way about Ms.Mei.
<es>

@533
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I don't want you to think bad about Hisae."
<es>

@534
<en>I was emotional when I saw the sad smile on his face. I couldn't say a word.
<es>

@535
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um...well..."
<es>

@538
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Oh, sorry... Don't take it seriously, just keep it in your mind as a jargon."
<es>

@539
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah...."
<es>

@540
<en>I don't know why we are talking about the principal now.
<es>

@541
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi! Come on!"
<es>

@542
<en>Ms.Mei calls me from outside the shop. I kept her wait longer than I was supposed to.
<es>

@545
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I think you'd better hurry up. You don't want a girl pissing off you."
<es>

@546
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you saying through your experience?"
<es>

@549
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Hahaha, well?"

<es>

@567

<es>

@568
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is it your turn to cook tomorrow, Sakura?"
<es>

@573
<en>{Pierre}\n"That means I can eat Rin's food. I can't wait for that."

@591

<es>

@595
<en>{Rin}\n"I am asking everybody's opinion about the food you wanna eat. How about you, Kazushi?"
<es>

@596
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's see...Curried rice."
<es>

@599
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wha? Another one? Boys love curry, I guess."
<es>

@600
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@604
<en>{Daigo}\n"I can eat curried rice everyday for about six month, though."

@611
<en>{Rin}\n"That's too much. I know it's easy to make, but I wanna make something different tomorrow."
<es>

<es>

@619

<en>{Haruka}\n"What-what? What's going on here?"
<es>

@636
<en>Haruka joined us, with Mizuki and Ran.
<es>

@642

<es>

@643

@648
<en>{Mei}\n"You sound having fun, guys. What are you talking about?"
<es>

@649
<en>Ms. Mei came in when we were having fun. She must've smelled food.
<es>

@650
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, good timing. What do you feel like eating tomorrow, Ms.Mei?"
<es>

@651
<en>We'd better ask Ms.Mei's opinion when it comes to food.
<es>

@658
<en>{Rin}\n"It's our turn tomorrow, so...."
<es>

@659
<en>{Sakura}\n"We are asking everyone what they want to eat."

<es>

@676

<es>

@683

@684

@695
<en>{Mei}\n"There is the sea out there."
<es>

@700
<en>{Appo-}\n"Do you catch the shark fin in the sea? (Fin sounds same as Fillet in Japanese)"
<es>

@701
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I thought that was meat. Because fin sounds like fillet of meat, doesn't it? Fin sounds like fillet of meat?"
<es>

@706
<en>{Haruka}\n"What? Is fellet of cutle caught in the ocean?"
<es>

@710
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I didn't know that. I never saw pork when I was swimming."
<es>

@714
<en>{Pierre}\n"Then, let's go fishing now."
<es>

@718
<en>{Haruka}\n"Fishing? I love to go, too~! Can you teach me how to fish, Kazushi?"

@719

@742

<es>

@747
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I never knew fin is for the shark fin."
<es>

@750
<en>{Appo-}\n"I didin't know shark fin is edible."
<es>

@751
<en>I learned the new thing from Ms.Mei who's amnesia. I know she teaches us all the time in the class.
<es>

@752
<en>I wonder how she can teach even though she doesn't have memory. I guess she didn't lose information about alchemy.
<es>

@755
<en>{Appo-}\n"I heard there were some sharks around here. Hu-sen told me that, she knows everything."
<es>

@756
<en>We got to watch out when Appo- tries to brag about his girlfriend, Hu-sen.
<es>

@759
<en>{Appo-}\n"Hu-sen could be an angel...."
<es>

@760
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you serious that, there are sharks around here? We should not swim in here, right?"
<es>

@763
<en>{Appo-}\n"Huh? Um...I mean there are sometimes here, but not all the time. I heard there was a speicial bait for that. I guess it was probably made in alchemy."
<es>

@764
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see, I didn't know the bait for the shark. Alchemy is cool...."
<es>

@765
<en>If there is such a thing, then I am sure I can catch it and give Ms.Mei a shark fin as a present. Food as a gift, she would give me a higher credit for sure.
<es>

@766
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you know where the bait for shark is?"
<es>

@767
<en>{Appo-}\n"I think fishermen have that, or Panchu, because he is into fishing these days."
<es>

@768
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Senior fellow..."
<es>

@773
<en>I found Panchu who was looking at the sea. He looks very cool on the spot.
<es>

@774
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Old man, Panchu!"
<es>

@777
<en>{Panchu-}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@778

<es>

@779
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you looking at?"
<es>

@780
<en>The sea is very calm today.
<es>

@783

<es>

@788

<es>

@789
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No way...this sea? It's so calm now, though."
<es>

@790
<en>I don't believe that, but if he says so, I guess it will be.
<es>

@791
<en>{Panchu-}\n"Why are you here?"
<es>

@792
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah. I have a question to ask you. Do you know where the bait for shark is?"
<es>

@795
<en>{Panchu-}\n"Here..."
<es>

@796
<en>He points out under his feet. There is a plastic bag down there, and inside it, one melon bread.
<es>

@797
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is only a melon bread."
<es>

@800
<en>{Panchu-}\n"I made this in alchemy, and I caught a shark with this. It is called bite at every cast."
<es>

@801
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You really made this, old man!"
<es>

@802
<en>How cool he is! The shark made a bite at every cast.
<es>

@803
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you mind if I have a little bit of that? I really need to catch shark fin today."
<es>

@806
<en>{Panchu-}\n"Shark fin....?"
<es>

@807
<en>He looked up at the sky. I don't know why he looked up, it must be something about shark up there.
<es>

@808
<en>{Kazushi}\n"............"
<es>

@809
<en>I look up in the sky, but nothing llike a shark. But, I just keep watching along with my old man.
<es>

@810
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi"
<es>

@811
<en>My favorite voice calls my name from behind. It's Ms.Mei.
<es>

@816
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, be careful and don't go too close to the water. It's dangerous."
<es>

@817

@820

<es>

@821
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Typhoon!?"
<es>

@822
<en>I look at my old man quickly. He's still looking at the sea. I think getting stromy could be right.
<es>

@825
<en>{Panchu-}\n"You have to give up fishing today."
<es>

@828
<en>{Mei}\n"Fishing? No way! You have to hold it another few days until typhoon goes away. You may get high waves which occur in high summer."
<es>

@829
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@832
<en>{Mei}\n"So, don't do it, okay? Can you promise with me?"
<es>

@833
<en>She puts her pinkie in front of me. that is so cute and shiny like a pearl.
<es>

@834
<en>But, it's too embarrassed to do that in front of Panchu. He may think I try to do a pickup.
<es>

@838
<en>{Mei}\n"Here, promise with me."
<es>

@839
<en>She pulled my arm impatiently and tangled her finger on mine.
<es>

@842
<en>{Mei}\n"Here is our promise....."
<es>

@843
<en>She shakes our fingers with rhythm.
<es>

@848
<en>{Panchu-}\n"Huh, huuuewww..."
<es>

@849
<en>I heard Panchu giggling. I was so embarrassed that he laughed at me when she treated me like a little kid.
<es>

@850
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think we did enough. I got you now."
<es>

@854
<en>I pulled my finger away quickly. She looked puzzeled a little, but soon, it went back to the normal expression.
<es>

@857
<en>{Mei}\n"Promise me, okay?"
<es>

@858
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh..."
<es>

@859
<en>I couldn't say yes because Panchu was around us, or I didn't like the way she treated me.
<es>

@862
<en>{Mei}\n"Look... it' s gonna rain soon. You'd better go back to the dorm before it starts raining. You, too, Panchu."
<es>

@866
<en>{Panchu-}\n"Sure"
<es>

@867
<en>As soon as he respended, he turns around and walks away.
<es>

@871
<en>{Mei}\n"You go home, too. Let's go home together."
<es>

@872
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, sure..."
<es>

@874
<en>THUD
<es>

@875

<es>

@876
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@879
<en>{Mei}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@880
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, nothing..."
<es>

@882
<en>I picked up the plastic bag and followed after her.
<es>

@883
<en>Hm...shark itself is a bait. If I catch shark, I wonder Ms.Mei would give me another credit.
<es>

@889
<en>I woke up with the sound of winds next morning.
<es>

@890
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I never knew my sleep could be interrupted by winds."

@898
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Here it comes...."
<es>

@899

<es>

@900
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I feel I can do whatever I want to do."
<es>

@901

<es>

@902
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No question about it. Okay!"
<es>

@903
<en>I go back to my dorm again. It was meant to be me to pick up the stuff Panchu forgot to take yesterday.
<es>

<es>

@980

@984
<en>{Mei}\n"What do you mean by you can't find him?"

@991
<en>{Appo-}\n"I don't see him anywhere since this morning. When I woke up in the morning, he's already gone."

@992
<en>{Pierre}\n"He is not here for dinner, strange....I looked around here, but he is nowhere."
<es>

@995
<en>{Mei}\n"Are you sure he is not in the dorm? And you looked outside, too."
<es>

@999
<en>{Daigo}\n"We were looking for outside, but it started raining very hard, so...."
<es>

@1004
<en>{Mei}\n"That's right. He won't be outside with this rain.......Has anybody seen Kazushi Haruma?"
<es>

@1006
<en>Ms.Mei asks everyone in the dining room. They all look at each other, but no information comes out.
<es>

@1009
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, come on. Does anybody know where he could be? How about you?"
<es>

@1010
<en>She asked Appo- and other two. They all look at each other and that's it.
<es>

@1018
<en>{Pierre}\n"I don't know where he went. I thought the place he could be was only the library where Mei stays. I don't know"
<es>

@1021
<en>{Daigo}\n"I think so, too. Hey, Appo-, do you remember what he was talking about yesterday?"
<es>

@1024
<en>{Appo-}\n"Hm....Oh, he was talking about fishing."
<es>

@1025
<en>When Appo- said that, Mei reacted shockingly.
<es>

@1031
<en>{Mei}\n"What? Fishing?"
<es>

@1032
<en>Of course, Mei remembers the promise he did yesterday. She shook her head desperately.
<es>

@1033
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't think so because I warned him not to go fishing until this typhoon is over, and he promised me, too."
<es>

@1038
<en>{Appo-}\n"Really? Well, I'm not sure where he is now. But, he was just talking that he wanted to catch a shark."
<es>

@1041
<en>{Mei}\n"Shark? Fishing for shark? Why shark?"
<es>

@1045
<en>{Haruka}\n"Are you talking about the shark fin?"
<es>

@1046
<en>Haruka came into their conversation raising her hand up.
<es>

@1050

@1053

<es>

@1057
<en>{Rin}\n"Did Kazushi go fishing for shark?"
<es>

@1058
<en>Mei was stunned. She said it out of half-joke, but Kazushi took her word seriously, and might be in the stormy ocean for that.
<es>

@1062
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, I can't believe it.....He promised me not to go fishing until this typhoon is over."

@1067

@1070

<es>

@1071
<en>{Mei}\n"For me?"
<es>

@1075
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah, it rings bell. Whenever storm is in front of him, he goes hyper. So, it's possible for him to get out of the room without thinking."

@1088
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Hey! I need some help, guys!"
<es>

@1089

@1094
<en>{Mei}\n"Mr.Yagami! What's going on?"
<es>

@1095

@1099
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Yes, I think Kazushi went fishing by himself."
<es>

@1100
<en>All of a sudden, she sees nothing but darkness ahead of her. She almost fainted, but kept sustaning her body, somehow.
<es>

@1103
<en>{Mei}\n"So, where is Kazushi?"
<es>

@1106
<en>I heard the commotion at the entrance of dining room.
<es>

@1110
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Over here!"
<es>

@1112
<en>After Yagami shouted, a bunch of guys dashed inside the dining room dragging a big shark.
<es>

@1114
<en>The thing looks dead, but I can see the sharp teeth lining up in the mouth with a familiar fabric hanging.
<es>

@1119

@1124

@1128

<es>

@1132
<en>{Pierre}\n"Does it mean Kazushi is in the shark's tummy now?"
<es>

@1135
<en>{Mei}\n"In the shark's stomach?"
<es>

@1136
<en>Mei's pale face gets worse, then she finally fainted losing strength trough her legs.
<es>

@1140
<en>{Haruka}\n"Mei, are you okay?"
<es>

@1144
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, we have to save Kazushi now."
<es>

@1148
<en>{Pierre}\n"Are you serious to cut this shark's stomach for saving Kazushi?"
<es>

@1152
<en>{Appo-}\n"Hm...He may be delicious."
<es>

@1159
<en>{Mizuki}\n"We don't have time to joke around."

@1163

@1189

@1192
<en>{Mei}\n"No, I'm fine. I stay here with him."
<es>

@1196
<en>{Haruka}\n"But you look very sick. You'd better take a rest."
<es>

@1199
<en>{Mei}\n"I am a teacher of Kazushi, and I'm still in charge of him even summer holiday."
<es>

@1200

<es>

@1205
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Bring a cutting knife!"
<es>

@1210
<en>{Appo-}\n"Oh, sure."
<es>

@1211

@1221

@1223
<en>Mr.Yagami slashed down a knife while everyone watching with bated breath.
<es>

@1229
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Hm!"
<es>

@1231
<en>I don't know Yagami's hand is good, or the knife is very sharp, the knife goes into it without any noise.
<es>

@1238
<en>{Sakura}\n"I hope he's still alive."
<es>

@1239
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh, c'mon! Don't talk like that!"
<es>

@1242
<en>{Mei}\n"Please, God....bring back Kazushi as alive..."
<es>

@1246
<en>The knife in Yagami's hand opens up the shark's stomach slowly. From a distance, everybody looks into the cutting part which getting wider.
<es>

@1249
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Kazushi!"
<es>

@1250
<en>Yagami shouts into the shark's stomach.
<es>

@1254
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes?"
<es>

@1255
<en>The Kazushi's voice was heard from behind them. Everybody looks back at the same time.
<es>

@1256
<en>There is Kazushi standing, being supported by Panchu.
<es>

@1259
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi?"
<es>

@1260
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? What are you fussing about?"
<es>

@1263
<en>I think they thought I was swallowed by the shark. I was surprised when I heard it.
<es>

@1264
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How did you think I was swallowed?"
<es>

@1267
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"We want to know that why. Anyway, whose idea was it first of all?"
<es>

@1268
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I caught a big fish, so I asked a bunch of guys to carry it."
<es>

@1272
<en>{Haruka}\n"What happened with the wound?"
<es>

@1273
<en>I had slight injury on my head. Ms.Mei is putting bandage on it.
<es>

@1274
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The shark tried to bite me getting wild."
<es>

@1278
<en>{Mei}\n"......!"
<es>

@1279
<en>Ms.Mei stopped working on my wound for a second.
<es>

@1284
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Are you serious?"
<es>

@1285
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am dead serious. Old man, Panchu was cool, though. Because he made the shark calm down by hitting with his fist."
<es>

@1289
<en>{Pierre}\n"Whoa....it sounds like a super human."
<es>

@1290
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Actually, I don't know what would've happened to me if Panchu wasn't there. I could be inside the shark's tummy in real."

<es>

@1306

<es>

@1308
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think you should take a rest. You look pale."
<es>

@1309
<en>Especially, her lips discolored into purple. She looks restless.

@1311
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I'm okay now."

@1312
<en>{Mei}\n"I see....Then, I don't need to worry any more."
<es>

@1313
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Worry?"
<es>

@1317
<en>Ms.Mei lifted her face quickly and gave me a glare. I saw her big eyes full of tears.
<es>

@1318
<en>I was very upset when I saw the tears in her eyes.
<es>

@1319

<es>

@1320
<en>{Mei}\n"You, son of a bitch!!"
<es>

@1324

<es>

@1341
<en>{Mei}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@1342
<en>She seems to be surprised what she's done, she looks at her opened hand and my face one after the other.

@1355
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Oh, man. I never expected Ms.Mei slapped Kazushi. She must be really angry."
<es>

@1356
<en>Yagami mutteres indifferently. He seems rather enjoying.
<es>

@1357
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, I don't know why she is angry that much."
<es>

@1360
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Oh, you got to be kidding me. Who goes fishing in this stromy weather, besides, to catch a shark. That's insane. If Ms.Mei didn't hit you, I could've done that to you, instead."
<es>

@1361
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see....."
<es>

@1362
<en>I acted crazily without thinking due to the typhoon.
<es>

@1368

<es>

@1369
<en>{Haruka}\n"Me, either."
<es>

@1374
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"That means how much she worried about you. You should go get her and apologize to her now."

<es>

@1379
<en>{Kazushi}\n"O-okay. I'll do it."

<es>

@1416
<en>{Mei}\n"Wha-why do you chase me?"
<es>

@1417
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Because you dashed out of the room without saying anything."
<es>

@1420
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, I see...I felt you might come and chase after me."
<es>

@1421
<en>She lowers her face muttering. I can see her face well, but it looks turning red.
<es>

@1422
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sorry I slapped you really hard."
<es>

@1423
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, don't worry. It was my fault."
<es>

@1424
<en>That was my falut 100 persent. I apologized her from my heart. Then, Ms.Mei stares at me.

@1427
<en>{Mei}\n"You're right. It's all your fault."

@1428

<es>

@1435

<es>

@1436

<es>

@1437
<en>When she lifted her head, tears dribbled down from her eyes.
<es>

@1440
<en>{Mei}\n"Do you have any idea how much I , or everybody worried about you? I never worried this much in my life. My heart could almost stop."
<es>

@1441
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Um...I'm sorry."
<es>

@1442
<en>All I do is apologizing to her, bowing my head one after another. But, Ms.Mei's eyes still glare at me.
<es>

@1446
<en>{Mei}\n"If a thing could be over with your apology, there is no reason to have police here! You were lucky that you were safe."
<es>

<es>

@1461
<en>Slap, slap.
<es>

@1463
<en>Her powerless flat hand hits me repeatedly, but I feel good as she was stroking me. However, I can feel her pain every time she slaps me.
<es>

@1464
<en>I am sort of happy because this is the first time for me to feel her real emotion.
<es>

@1465
<en>Ms.Mei was always nice to us, but she never showed her emotions like this before.
<es>

@1466
<en>The reason I feel deep in my heart when she hit me is probably her emotional upset about me.
<es>

<es>

@1470

@1476

@1613

@1647

@1650
<en>{Mei}\n"So did I. It was my first time to get mad like that."

@1651

@1652

<es>

@1655
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"You can't protest for no-physical punishment in public any more, can you? Ha,Ha,Ha, Ha..."
<es>

@1656
<en>Mr.Yagami is laughing, but Ms.Mei is looking down thinking something.
<es>

@1659
<en>{Mei}\n"I didin't know what I was doing until I hit him. I was out of mind completely, and never happened before."
<es>

@1662
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"That means you were really serious about him, weren't you? I think it's good to loose cool for real when you get involve in somebody."
<es>

@1665
<en>{Mei}\n"I think that disqualifies as a teacher. You keep yourself cool all the time, and lead your students to a good direction, that's what teacher's role is about.Don't you agree?"
<es>

@1666
<en>I know that's what she kept believing. I think Ms.Mei is exactly following the image.
<es>

@1668
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Well, I know you've been a role model as a teacher, but you were somehow mechanical, I mean just following the rule, and that's about it. I wasn't really happy about your syle as a teacher."
<es>

@1672
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, so you don' like me, just what I thoutht? Oh, so you din't like me, just what I thought."
<es>

@1673
<en>Mr.Yagami didn't like Ms.Mei...but they are friendly now. Both of them are good looking that makes me jealous.
<es>

@1676
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"But when you hit Kazushi today, I liked it very much because you showed your passion toward Kazushi."
<es>

@1677
<en>Mr.Yagami gives a full smile. That was very nice smile which I could love even as a man.
<es>

@1680
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"I'm glad you really thought about Kazushi. Well, I think the motive wasn't really good, but....."
<es>

@1683
<en>Ms.Mei blushes when she realized what he meant. I got blushed, too.
<es>

@1686
<en>{Mei}\n"I think I'm not a good teacher since I had a special feeling in only one student."
<es>

@1687
<en>What? Only one student...Is she talking about me? She was really...?
<es>

@1690
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Obviously, it's not acceptable, but it's not really serious matter, either, I think."
<es>

@1693
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Even a teacher and a student are female and male after all. That's the way things are."
<es>

@1696
<en>{Mei}\n"Is that right?"
<es>

@1699
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"I'm sure. Even you know you love him, it sometimes deons't happen anything between you. But surprisingly, you may find a big, true love out of nowhere when you are not planning to be in love with somebody."
<es>

@1701
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"You never cared about a girl until yesterday, but today, you are desperately in love with her. That kind of thing happens all the time. What I want to say is it's not up to you."
<es>

@1705
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"It's an act of God. It is out of our control, I believe."
<es>

@1708
<en>{Mei}\n"Are you talking from your own experience? Were you in love with your wife at first?"
<es>

@1711
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Ha,Ha.., Our case is a baby first, and marriage. So, I would call that was by God's grace."
<es>

@1714
<en>{Mei}\n"God's..."
<es>

@1715
<en>God....I never thought about God, but if I can marry with Ms.Mei by God's grace, I can try believing God.
<es>

@1718
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"You don't think what you can do to make it happen. Because you can't control your feeling toward him, as like or don't like."
<es>

@1721
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, I know what it means...."
<es>

@1722
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"You may be conservative in the field, or just innocent, but I can say you are sort of out of touch with those things."
<es>

@1725
<en>{Mei}\n"Do you think so? I don't know about what I am doing."
<es>

@1728
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"I can tell you are sort of awkward. Because you picked Kazushi even there were so many guys out there."
<es>

@1729
<en>Wha-What is he talking about, Yagami? Ms.Mei was just talking about a real feeling toward me, do not destroy it!
<es>

@1732
<en>{Mei}\n"Actually, I don't know much about guys. Um...Kazushi isn't good to me?"
<es>

@1733
<en>See? Ms.Mei starts to worry.
<es>

@1736
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Uhh... he's okay. He is a nice guy, but stupid, though."
<es>

@1737
<en>Foget the word 'stupidness'!
<es>

@1740
<en>{Mei}\n"You're right. huhhh...."
<es>

@1741
<en>Hey, they are laughing about me after agreeing with my stupidness.
<es>

@1742
<en>{Mei}\n"chuckle....It's funny, isn't it?"
<es>

@1743
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hm....Why is it so funny?"
<es>

@1744
<en>She is laughing to tears. Well, as long as Ms.Mei is happy, I am okay. I think it's better than she's crying.
<es>

@1758

<en>Ms.Mei looks outside the window putting her chin in her hand, which makes her look very cool.
<es>

@1764
<en>I am amazed I am feeling satisfaction by just looking at her.
<es>

@1765
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you have something for me to do today?"
<es>

@1766
<en>I have an urge to do something to help her, not because I trying to make up for yesterday's incident.
<es>

@1769
<en>{Mei}\n"Are you bored just watching?"
<es>

@1770
<en>She asked me watching outside the window.
<es>

@1771
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not really, but I have lots of energy left."
<es>

@1774
<en>{Mei}\n"Really, I know the young boy like you has a lot of energy inside. You must be bored falling love with an old lady, aren't you?"
<es>

@1775
<en>I realized when she asked me a question like that, I felt it was not as usual as she was.
<es>

@1776
<en>So, I said to her clearly looking at her profile.
<es>

@1777
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am happy everyday because I am in love with somebody."
<es>

@1780
<en>{Mei}\n"Really?"
<es>

@1781
<en>She showed a little bit agitation.
<es>

@1782
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I had very hard time to get up in the morning before, but now, I look forward to every moring becauase I can see the person I like."
<es>

@1783
<en>{Mei}\n"Re-Really? I see....I'm amazed you speak up like this."
<es>

@1784
<en>She still looks outside, but I strongly feel her focus is on me.
<es>

@1785
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nothing to be amazed. If you compare with what I've been feeling everyday, this is nothing."
<es>

@1788
<en>{Mei}\n"Really?"
<es>

@1789
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really."
<es>

@1790
<en>Ms.Mei became quiet as she felt the pressure. Her profile looks somehow gloomy, watching driving rain.
<es>

@1793
<en>{Mei}\n"Do you like being in love?"
<es>

@1794
<en>After a few seconds of silence, she asked me hesitantly and turned around toward me for a change.
<es>

@1795
<en>I stares at her with confidence, then, replied with a big nod.
<es>

@1796
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's the best. That makes you feel alive."
<es>

@1799
<en>{Mei}\n"I see....Well, then, the feeling I have now is not love?"
<es>

@1800
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean by the feeling you have now?"
<es>

@1801
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sure I have a special feeling toward you, but I don't know that is love or not."
<es>

@1802
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can you describe what feeling it is?"
<es>

@1803
<en>{Mei}\n"Um...let's see...I can't sleep well these days..."
<es>

@1804
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, it's love feelilng! I'm sure!"
<es>

@1805
<en>I wanted to conclude that way, but Ms.Mei gave me a glare.
<es>

@1808
<en>{Mei}\n"You are trying to mess me aound because I don't know anyting about those."
<es>

@1809
<en>She gave me a sweet glare. She is still sharp.
<es>

@1810
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No way, never....But I know there is different kind of symptom when it comes to love. Can you describe something else?"
<es>

@1813
<en>{Mei}\n"Let's see....When I realized, I was thinking of only that person, sometimes."
<es>

@1814
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does that person mean....me?"
<es>

@1817
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, I can't tell you."
<es>

@1818
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't answer you unless you tell me who's the person is."
<es>

@1819
<en>I guess she was talking about me according to our conversation.
<es>

@1820
<en>Well, if you think about that I never won the sweet deal before, so, it could be somebody else, not me.
<es>

@1821
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh...."
<es>

@1824
<en>{Mei}\n"Hey, what's going on holding the head in your hand? Are you okay?"

<es>

<es>

@1845
<en>What a childish question....but I already know my answer is.
<es>

@1846
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course. Being love with somebody is wonderful thing and I like it."

<es>

@1861
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ms.Mei"
<es>

<es>

@1875

<es>

@1900
<en>Ms.Mei shouted back with almost crying face.
<es>
