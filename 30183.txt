<en>{Ran}\n"Ouch...It hurts..."
<es>

@11
<en>Ran puts her clothes back on and walks slightly bandy-legged.
<es>

@12
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does it really hurt?"
<es>

@15
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah, a little bit. We need to wait a few days for the next one."
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The next one?"
<es>

@19
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't you wanna do it again?"
<es>

@20
<en>Ran gives me a wonderful smile. With no naughtiness, the smile looks very refreshing.
<es>

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course, I wanna do it again. How come you are smiling so much?"
<es>

@24
<en>{Ran}\n"Never mind. Don't feel hesitant to let me know when you want to it again. Okay?"
<es>

@25
<en>It must have hurt her. But she is so willing to do it again with, which I have no complaint about.
<es>

@26
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh...Okay."
<es>

@27
<en>Out of her pocket, Ran takes the envelope with 1 million yen in it.
<es>

@30
<en>{Ran}\n"So what are you going to do with this money?"
<es>

@31
<en>"That money is yours. You need 1 million yen, right?"
<es>

@34
<en>{Ran}\n"Did I say that?"
<es>

@35
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You forgot what you said?"
<es>

@38
<en>{Ran}\n"No, I didn't. I was just amazed you really got 1 million yen."
<es>

@39
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I was amazed myself..."
<es>

@40
<en>I shudder at the sight of 1 million yen.
<es>

@43
<en>{Ran}\n"Will you really lend me this money?"
<es>

@44
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course. I got that money for that."
<es>

@47
<en>{Ran}\n"Thanks. I will give this back to you."
<es>

@48
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure."
<es>

@49
<en>I was going to ask her to return the money before my dad finds out about this. But I didn't say because I didn't want to sound stingy.
<es>

@50
<en>{Ran}\n"No worries. I will return this to you all at once."
<es>

@51
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm not gonna really use this money anyway."
<es>

@52
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What do you mean?"
<es>

@55
<en>{Ran}\n"Never mind. Thanks again for this."
<es>

@56
<en>Ran puts the envelope back into her pocket. Ahh, my, no...my-dad's-bike-turned-to-1 million yen goes to hers...
<es>

@59
<en>{Ran}\n"Hehe. I owe you a lot, Kazushi. I have never owed anyone any money before."
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I know..."
<es>

@61
<en>{Ran}\n"And you've become my first man..."
<es>

@62
<en>Ran said happily.
<es>

@63
<en>So I am the first man for her in many ways, huh?
<es>

@64
<en>{Ran}\n"Whew, I feel so flushed..."
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Appo frequents Fusen's room, huh?"
<es>

@72
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah. They are deeply in love, you know?"
<es>

@73
<en>Ran and I went to the cafeteria for breakfast.
<es>

@74
<en>Even during the summer vacation, we still see our friends every day.
<es>

@79
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh. Kazushi!"
<es>

@85
<en>{Daigo}\n"He is with Ran."
<es>

@93
<en>{Sakura}\n"WowThey are bold to come out together like that this morning"
<es>

@97
<en>The minute we stepped in the hall, everyone looked at us, while speaking in a whisper to one another.
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's going on here?"
<es>

@101
<en>{Ran}\n"A rumor has it that I am pregnant with you baby, Kazushi."
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?! What that hell does that mean?"
<es>

@103
<en>{Ran}\n"That misunderstanding has been already cleared up. So don't worry."
<es>

@104
<en>Ran said it bluntly like it doesn't concern her at all.
<es>

@105
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, you sound like it is not your problem. But I have absolutely no idea what is going on."
<es>

@108
<en>{Ran}\n"Never mind. It's just a gossip. It is gonna go away soon."
<es>

@109
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know but..."
<es>

@110
<en>Ran left me hanging with that such a curt response. And immediately, we both got surrounded by our friends.
<es>

@115
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"It looks like thing went okay between you two last night."
<es>

@116
<en>While eating breakfast with Appo, Fusen gives us a suggestive look.
<es>

@121
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah, kind of. I guess thanks to you, I should say?"
<es>

@124
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Don't mention it. It was my plan to spend the night with Appo anyway."
<es>

@129
<en>{Appo-}\n"We had a good time last night, didn't we, Kazushi? Do you know how many holes the girl has?"
<es>

@130
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't know. And I don't want to know."
<es>

@134
<en>{Ran}\n"How far are you guys going in a relationship?"
<es>

@137
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"It's a secret..."
<es>

@138
<en>Fusen winked at Ran, which was a bit frightening.
<es>

@143
<en>{Pierre}\n"What does "things went okay"mean?"
<es>

@148
<en>{Daigo}\n"Hey, did you guys already...?"
<es>

@153
<en>{Rin}\n"What? That rumor is not really a rumor, then?"
<es>

@158
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Ran is really pregnant, then?"
<es>

@159
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, stop it! What are you guys talking about? She is not pregnant because we don't..."
<es>

@160
<en>Oh, shit...We did.
<es>

@161
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hahaha."
<es>

@162
<en>I try to hide my embarrassment behind a smile. Everyone stares at me.
<es>

@167
<en>{Daigo}\n"Why keeps you from talking all of a sudden?"
<es>

@172
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, have you done it already? You two...finally..."
<es>

@173
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh...Well..."
<es>

@176
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi...At last..."
<es>

@177
<en>Hey, don't cry over this. I was not doing anything behind their back.
<es>

@182
<en>{Ran}\n"Hahaha. I am not pregnant."
<es>

@186
<en>{Daigo}\n"She only denies her pregnancy..."
<es>

@191
<en>{Sakura}\n"That means they already did..."
<es>

@195
<en>{Rin}\n"Coed is amazing."
<es>

@198
<en>{Sakura}\n"So how was it?"
<es>

@201
<en>The girls encircle Ran, asking her questions. She answers them with a smile.
<es>

@202
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She looks different."
<es>

@203
<en>She was not like that, giving people a pleasant smile.
<es>

@206
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Love changes women, especially, summer love."
<es>

@207
<en>Fusen talks to me in a whisper while looking at the other girls. Fusen looks very mature.
<es>

@208
<en>I guess she's reached adulthood a little earlier than others.
<es>

@209
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Love, huh?"
<es>

@212
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"know it because I've changed myself since I fell for Appo. Love changes people. And love changes your world instantly."
<es>

@213
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fusen, you are quite a poet."
<es>

@214
<en>Maybe she was a poet before. Or she has become one because of love?
<es>

@217
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Ran used to only care about money. But I think she will change because she has found something more important than money."
<es>

@218
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You think so?"
<es>

@219
<en>Something more important than money? Is that me?
<es>

@223
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Come here!!"
<es>

@224
<en>Ran, in a huddle of the girls, asks me to join them, while giving me the best smile I've ever seen.
<es>

@225
<en>Has she really changed? Will she change? How will she and I change?
<es>
