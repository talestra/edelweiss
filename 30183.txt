<en>{Ran}\n"Ugh, owwww..."
<es>

@11
<en>Ran put her clothes back on and walked 2-3 slightly bow-legged steps around the room before grimacing.
<es>

@12
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does it really hurt?"
<es>

@15
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah, a little bit. We may need to wait a few days before having another go."
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Another go?"
<es>

@19
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't you wanna do it again?"
<es>

@20
<en>Ran gave me a wonderful smile that felt refreshing, not indecent.
<es>

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course I wanna do it again.\n...How come you're smiling so much?"
<es>

@24
<en>{Ran}\n"Never mind. Don't hesitate to let me know when you want to do it again, okay? Don't let it build up."
<es>

@25
<en>She was clearly hurting, but she was already willing to go again? Well, nothing but good news to me.
<es>

@26
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, right."
<es>

@27
<en>Ran took the envelope with the million yen out of her pocket.
<es>

@30
<en>{Ran}\n"So what are you going to do with this money?"
<es>

@31
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm lending it to you. The first amount you asked for was 1 million yen. You need it, right?"
<es>

@34
<en>{Ran}\n"Did I say that?"
<es>

@35
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did you forget asking for it?"
<es>

@38
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, no, I didn't. I was just amazed that you really got me a million yen."
<es>

@39
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I was amazed myself..."
<es>

@40
<en>I shuddered at how much 1,000,000 yen was in cash.
<es>

@43
<en>{Ran}\n"Will you really lend me this money?"
<es>

@44
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course. That's what I got it for."
<es>

@47
<en>{Ran}\n"Okay. Yeah, I'll be glad to take it then. ......I'll be sure to pay it back."
<es>

@48
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, please do."
<es>

@49
<en>I was going to ask her to return the money before my dad found out what I'd done, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to sound stingy.
<es>

@50
<en>{Ran}\n"No worries. I'll pay it back, the whole amount at once."
<es>

@51
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm not really gonna use this money anyways."
<es>

@52
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What did you say?"
<es>

@55
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, nothing. Thanks again for this."
<es>

@56
<en>Ran put the money envelope in her hip pocket. Ahh--my...no... my dad's bike turned one million yen is...
<es>

@59
<en>{Ran}\n"Hehe, I owe you a lot, Kazushi. I've never owed anybody money before."
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I know..."
<es>

@61
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, you're my first one."
<es>

@62
<en>Ran said happily. Does the other first time not matter?
<es>

@63
<en>I'm your first in bed and that means like nothing to you?
<es>

@64
<en>{Ran}\n"Whew, I feel so flushed... I hope you'll take good care of me."
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Appo spends a lot of time in Fuusen's room, huh?"
<es>

@72
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah. They're madly in love, you know?"
<es>

@73
<en>As we chatted away it came time for breakfast so Ran and I went to the cafeteria together.
<es>

@74
<en>Even though it was summer break, we still saw our friends every day.
<es>

@79
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh. Kazushi!"
<es>

@85
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kamoike's with him."
<es>

@93
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wow. They're bold, coming down together like that in the morning."
<es>

@97
<en>From the moment we entered the cafeteria, everybody began looking at us, whispering from one person to another.
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's everyone talking about?"
<es>

@101
<en>{Ran}\n"There's a rumour going around that you knocked me up, Kazushi."
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?! What the hell?!"
<es>

@103
<en>{Ran}\n"That misunderstanding has already been cleared up, so don't worry."
<es>

@104
<en>Ran said it bluntly like it didn't concern her at all.
<es>

@105
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, you sound like it's not your problem, but I've got absolutely no idea what's going on..."
<es>

@108
<en>{Ran}\n"Never mind. It's just gossip and it'll go away soon."
<es>

@109
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know, but..."
<es>

@110
<en>Ran left me hanging with such a curt response, and we were both immediately surrounded by our friends.
<es>

@115
<en>{Fuusen}\n"It looks like things went well between you two last night."
<es>

@116
<en>Fuusen gave us a suggestive look while eating breakfast with Appo.
<es>

@121
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah, it did. I guess thanks to you, I should say?"
<es>

@124
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Don't mention it. We just did what we wanted to. I was planning to spend the night with Ah-chan anyways."
<es>

@129
<en>{Appo}\n"It was hot last night, wasn't it Kazushi? How many holes do you think a woman's body has?"
<es>

@130
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No clue. And I don't want to hear about it, so don't tell me."
<es>

@134
<en>{Ran}\n"How far have you guys gone in your relationship?"
<es>

@137
<en>{Fuusen}\n"It's a secret..."
<es>

@138
<en>Fuusen winked at Ran, which was a bit frightening.
<es>

@143
<en>{Pierre}\n"What does 'things went okay' mean?"
<es>

@148
<en>{Daigo}\n"D-did you guys already...?"
<es>

@153
<en>{Rin}\n"What? Then the rumour isn't really just a rumour?"
<es>

@158
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Then Ran's really pregnant?"
<es>

@159
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, stop it! What are you guys talking about? She can't be pregnant, because we haven't..."
<es>

@160
<en>...oh shit.\nWe have.
<es>

@161
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahaha..."
<es>

@162
<en>I try to hide my embarrassment behind a smile. Everyone stared at me.
<es>

@167
<en>{Daigo}\n"Why'd you go all silent all of a sudden? You're suspicious."
<es>

@172
<en>{Pierre}\n"Haven't what? ...Have you done it?! Kazushi, you too?!"
<es>

@173
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh... Well..."
<es>

@176
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi's finally... Ooh...!"
<es>

@177
<en>Hey, don't cry about this. I haven't done anything to betray you guys or cause regret.
<es>

@182
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahaha, but I'm not pregnant."
<es>

@186
<en>{Daigo}\n"She only denies the pregnancy..."
<es>

@191
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wow. That means they've already..."
<es>

@195
<en>{Rin}\n"Th-they have? Going co-ed is amazing!"
<es>

@198
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hey, hey, how was it?"
<es>

@201
<en>The girls encircled Ran, asking her questions. She answered them with a smile.
<es>

@202
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's changed a bit."
<es>

@203
<en>She wasn't like that before, giving people pleasant smiles.
<es>

@206
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Love changes women. Especially summer love."
<es>

@207
<en>Fuusen whispered her advice to me while looking at the other girls carrying on. She looked very mature by comparison.
<es>

@208
<en>I guess she's reached adulthood a bit earlier than the others.
<es>

@209
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Love, huh?"
<es>

@212
<en>{Fuusen}\n"I know it because I've changed myself since I fell for Ah-chan. Love changes people, and it changes your world in an instant."
<es>

@213
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're quite the poet, Fuusen."
<es>

@214
<en>Maybe she was a poet before. Or had she become one because of love?
<es>

@217
<en>{Fuusen}\n"All Ran used to care about was money. But I think she'll change because now, because she's finally found something more important to her."
<es>

@218
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You think so?"
<es>

@219
<en>Something more important than money? Is that me?
<es>

@223
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi! Come here!!"
<es>

@224
<en>Ran, trapped in a huddle of the girls, asked me to join them while giving me the best smile I've ever seen.
<es>

@225
<en>Has she really changed? Will she change from now? And how will she and I both change together?
<es>
