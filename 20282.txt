@7
<en>Having someone to love made my day to day life on the island so much more enriching.
<es>

@8
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Mizuki."
<es>

@9
<en>I saw Mizuki in the laundry room.
<es>

@13
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, good morning, Kazushi!"
<es>

@14
<en>She seemed to be in a good mood this morning. I felt so happy and excited just to see her.
<es>

@17
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, right!"
<es>

@18
<en>She sidled up close to me and whispered in my ear.
<es>

@21
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It came like it should."
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What came?"
<es>

@23
<en>I didn't work out the message right away, but...
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, your period."
<es>

@27
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Right. It came as scheduled. So you can relax."
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, good."
<es>

@29
<en>I guess I don't have to worry about her being pregnant if her period came. Man, I can't believe I'm talking about periods. I never thought this day would come.
<es>

@30
<en>I NEVER thought this day would come.
<es>

@31
<en>I guess that romantic relationship means that we start discussing topics that we've never dealt with before.
<es>

@34
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, let me warn you now. My periods are heavy, so tomorrow or the day after, I may be in a really bad mood. I'm sorry if I take it out on you."
<es>

@35
<en>She bowed to me with her hands together like she was praying.
<es>

@36
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think I can deal with that."
<es>

@39
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But I don't just take it out on everyone around me. I'll probably go after you because you're the only one I want love and comfort from, so forgive me, okay?"
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I kind of feel sorry for you. Yeah, sure. Come to me whenever you need love and comfort. I-I am your boyfriend, you know."
<es>

@41
<en>I felt a bit embarrassed. Mizuki and I both looked flushed.
<es>

@44
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Thanks, Kazushi."
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can count on me."
<es>

@51
<en>The next day...
<es>

@54
<en>{Rin}\n"Haruma-kun!"
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Fujisaki-san?"
<es>

@56
<en>Rin ran towards me as she waved her hand.\nThere must be something she wants to tell me.
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's going on?"
<es>

@60
<en>{Rin}\n"Well, Mizuki-chan..."
<es>

@61
<en>Ran looked around and whispered in my ear.
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? She wants to see me?"
<es>

@65
<en>{Rin}\n"Yeah. She's, umm... not feeling so good today."
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not feeling so good? ...Oh, that."
<es>

@67
<en>It rang a bell right away - we'd talked about this yesterday.
<es>

@68
<en>{Rin}\n"Huh? Haruma-kun, do you keep track of Mizuki-chan's cycle?"
<es>

@69
<en>Rin seemed surprised.
<es>

@70
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, not the exact cycle yet. But it's a boyfriend's job to be considerate about that, right?"
<es>

@71
<en>{Rin}\n"Wow. You've really got it together. You are a good boyfriend."
<es>

@72
<en>Then she seemed impressed.
<es>

@73
<en>{Rin}\n"Well, Mizuki-chan's calling, so will you come?"
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure. I'll provide her with as much comfort as she wants."
<es>

@82
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You're late."
<es>

@83
<en>Mizuki greeted me in a bad mood right off the bat. I planned to comfort her, but I was a little frightened by that frown. She looked so tired as she lay in bed.
<es>

@84
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, sorry. How are you feeling?"
<es>

@87
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Do you think I'm feeling good? Ugh, uugh..."
<es>

@88
<en>She clutched her stomach and groaned.
<es>

@89
<en>{Mizuki}\n"My stomach hurts. It feels so bad! Uugh, uugh!"
<es>

@90
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh, umm, what should I do?"
<es>

@91
<en>I didn't have the slightest idea of what to do.
<es>

@92
<en>In a situation like this I'm completely powerless. All I can do is watch and wait for instructions from Fujisaki-san.
<es>

@96
<en>{Rin}\n"Maybe you should rub her back..."
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, okay."
<es>

@99
<en>Just watching her pain was heartbreaking. I rushed over to sit next to her.
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I hope this helps you."
<es>

@101
<en>I touched her back.
<es>

@104
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@105
<en>Mizuki grunted through a sniffle. It seemed she felt a bit better from the back rub.
<es>

@109
<en>{Rin}\n"Simple touching can sometimes make a big difference. Maybe the human touch has some kind of magic power."
<es>

@110
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You think so?"
<es>

@111
<en>That's pretty encouraging to me. It means there should be something I can do for her.
<es>

@115
<en>{Mizuki}\n"........."
<es>

@116
<en>Mizuki gave me an angry look right as I began to feel encouraged.
<es>

@117
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Do you find it more fun to talk to Rin than the bleeding, dirty me now?"
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about?"
<es>

@123
<en>{Rin}\n"Why are you saying that?"
<es>

@124
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Because..."
<es>

@125
<en>Mizuki looked upset. Even the most trivial of things seem to get on her nerves right now. I knew from my sister that sickness could make one act like that.
<es>

@126
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Jeez, you worry about such crazy things. Even if you are bleeding, you're far cuter than her!"
<es>

@129
<en>{Rin}\n"You see, Mizuki? Haruma-kun doesn't care about anyone but you."
<es>

@130
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course!"
<es>

@131
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Looks like you two hit it off well."
<es>

@132
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The hell?!"
<es>

@133
<en>I guess nothing's going to work with her now. I'll just have to smile and nod until it passes.
<es>

@136
<en>{Rin}\n"Th-then I'm gonna go now. I'll leave you two alone."
<es>

@137
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@138
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you apologizing for, Kazushi?"
<es>

@139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, yes. No worries. Just close your eyes. I'm sure you'll feel a little better."
<es>

@140
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Grr..."
<es>

@144
<en>Fujisaki-san smiled at our exchange.
<es>

@145
<en>{Rin}\n"You're so kind, Haruma-kun."
<es>

@146
<en>Rin muttered it so that only I could hear. I flushed a bit.
<es>

@147
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, anyone can get like this when they're sick. A little selfishness every once in a while is kind of cute."
<es>

@148
<en>{Rin}\n"Wow. You sound so mature."
<es>

@149
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Heh. Well, I am getting there."
<es>

@152
<en>{Rin}\n"Good for you, Mizuki-chan. I wish I had an understanding boyfriend like him."
<es>

@153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure you'll get one soon."
<es>

@157
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you two whispering about? What are you two whispering about?"
<es>

@159
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ow! Ow!?"
<es>

@160
<en>Mizuki pulled out some of my leg hairs!\nI know what I said before, but right now I want to say Fujisaki-san's cuter than a foul-mood Mizuki!
<es>

@164
<en>{Rin}\n"Mizuki-chan, enough."
<es>

@166
<en>*Smack*
<es>

@167
<en>Fujisaki-san knocked Mizuki on the head with her delicate fist.
<es>

@171
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ouch..."
<es>

@175
<en>{Rin}\n"I know you're feeling sick, but if you're so difficult and give Haruma-kun too hard of a time then I'm going to have to steal him from you."
<es>

@180
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What!!?"
<es>

@181
<en>Mizuki suddenly bolted up from bed.
<es>

@182
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh, uh, uhhh..."
<es>

@183
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...steal me from her? Fujisaki-san?"
<es>

@184
<en>Does Fujisaki-san have feelings for me too...?\nThey say everybody blooms into love once in their life, and now's my time?
<es>

@185
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uwahwah...uwahwah..."
<es>

@188
<en>{Rin}\n"Hey, don't get so serious. I'm just kidding - Haruma-kun's not actually my type."
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh...?"
<es>

@192
<en>{Mizuki}\n"R-really? Whew..."
<es>

@193
<en>I knew it sounded too good to be true. I wouldn't know how to handle two girls at the same time anyways.
<es>

@196
<en>{Rin}\n"Okay, then I'm leaving. Take care. Oh, of Haruma-kun too, not just your body."
<es>

@198
<en>Fujisaki-san winked at me and left the room.
<es>

@199
<en>Fujisaki-san was certainly a mischievous character.
<es>

@202
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you looking at?"
<es>

@203
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Urk..."
<es>

@204
<en>Shit. Without thinking about it I found myself looking at Rin's exit, which seemed to upset Mizuki.
<es>

@207
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, sorry! Rin just chewed me out for this."
<es>

@208
<en>It seemed that Mizuki felt bad about complaining so much and she held her head in her hands.
<es>

@209
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry, Mizuki. It only comes once a month, right?"
<es>

@212
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ohh... Even though I'm so selfish... you're so kind, Kazushi."
<es>

@213
<en>I noticed her eyes getting teary. Was she about to bawl? Was she?
<es>

@214
<en>Either way, it was kind of fun watching Mizuki's moods swing.
<es>

@215
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, lie down."
<es>

@216
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes."
<es>

@218
<en>I laid her down in bed and began massaging her back.
<es>

@221
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, you don't have to..."
<es>

@222
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No sweat. It feels better, right?"
<es>

@223
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes, it does. But no sex yet, okay?"
<es>

@224
<en>Her body twitched a bit as I touched it.
<es>

@225
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. I'll be patient."
<es>

@226
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@227
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't apologize for it."
<es>

@228
<en>But the truth of the matter was that touching her body was enough to make my shaft start to grow.\nFor now, I'll just have to grin and bear it.
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can be a little selfish, you know?"
<es>

@232
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Then I want some pudding!"
<es>

@233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Pudding? Did they carry that here?"
<es>

@234
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I want some ice cream too. And I want to meet the Three Stooges!"
<es>

@235
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's not possible."
<es>

@236
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I haven't bought a swimsuit this year, so I'd love a brand-new one. Also, I want a white house on a small hill overlooking the ocean."
<es>

@237
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, hey. Now you're getting out of hand. By the way, white houses are a pain to keep clean."
<es>

@240
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's fine. Also, I want..."
<es>

@241
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You got more?"
<es>

@244
<en>{Mizuki}\n"For now, kiss me!"
<es>

@245
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh...?"
<es>

@246
<en>I didn't get what she said at first.
<es>

@249
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Mmmmmm."
<es>

@250
<en>Mizuki cutely pushed her lips out.
<es>

@251
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How can I refuse?"
<es>

@252
<en>I nestled Mizuki against me and kissed her cute lips.
<es>

@253
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Mmm..."
<es>

@254
<en>After we kiss for a bit more, I'll go buy her that pudding.
<es>
