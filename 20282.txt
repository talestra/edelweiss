@7
<en>Loving someone makes my daily life in the island so enriching.
<es>

@8
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Mizuki."
<es>

@9
<en>I see Mizuki in the laundry room.
<es>

@13
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, good morning!"
<es>

@14
<en>She seems to be in a good mood this morning. I am so happy and excited to see Mizuki.
<es>

@17
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh!"
<es>

@18
<en>She comes close by and whispers in my ear.
<es>

@21
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It came..."
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What came?"
<es>

@23
<en>I didn't get that message right away, but...
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, your period."
<es>

@27
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Right. It came as scheduled. So you can relax."
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, good."
<es>

@29
<en>This means I didn't knock her up. Good. But it is still very strange for me to get involved in the talk on women's period.
<es>

@30
<en>I never dreamed of such a day coming.
<es>

@31
<en>I guess romantic relationships can get us associated with the wording, one has never used before.
<es>

@35
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, I need to warn you that I am pretty moody when the period hits me. So I may be pretty bitchy in the next couple days and take everything out to you. If that happens, please don't take personally and let me apologize in advance."
<es>

@37
<en>She bows to me with her hands together like praying.
<es>

@38
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think I can deal with that."
<es>

@41
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But I don't take it out on anyone else around. Probably I might take it out on you because I just want love and comfort from you. Okay?"
<es>

@42
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I kind of feel sorry for you. Yeah, sure. Come to me whenever you need love and comfort. After all, I am your boyfriend, you know."
<es>

@43
<en>I feel a bit embarrassed. Mizuki and I both look flushed.
<es>

@46
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Thanks, Kazushi."
<es>

@47
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can count on me."
<es>

@53
<en>Next day -
<es>

@56
<en>{Rin}\n"Kazushi!"
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Rin?"
<es>

@58
<en>Rin runs toward me as she waves her hand. There must be something she wants to tell me.
<es>

@59
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's going on?"
<es>

@62
<en>{Rin}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@63
<en>Rin looks around and whispers in my ear.
<es>

@64
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? She wants to see me?"
<es>

@67
<en>{Rin}\n"Yeah. She is not feeling good today."
<es>

@68
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not feeling good? You mean because of the women thing?"
<es>

@69
<en>It rings bell right away. She talked about it yesterday
<es>

@70
<en>{Rin}\n"Wow! Kazushi. You know Mizuki's period? So do you keep track on that?"
<es>

@71
<en>Rin seems surprised.
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no. I just know a little bit about it. Since I am her boyfriend, I guess I should know that kind of stuff too, right?"
<es>

@73
<en>{Rin}\n"I'm impressed. A good boyfriend."
<es>

@74
<en>Then she seems impressed.
<es>

@75
<en>{Rin}\n"Anyways, Mizuki wants you to come now."
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure. I will give as much comfort as she wants."
<es>

@84
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You're late."
<es>

@85
<en>Mizuki greets me in a bad mood, right off the bat. She looks so tired as she lies in bed.
<es>

@86
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, sorry. How are you feeling?"
<es>

@89
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Do you think I'm feeling good? Ooohh..."
<es>

@90
<en>Touching her belly, she grunts in agony.
<es>

@91
<en>{Mizuki}\n"My stomach hurts. It feels so bad...Ooohh..."
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Gee...What should I do?"
<es>

@93
<en>I don't have the slightest idea of what to do.
<es>

@94
<en>In a situation like this, I am completely powerless. All I can do is to wait for Rin's instructions.
<es>

@98
<en>{Rin}\n"Maybe, you should rub her back."
<es>

@99
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, okay."
<es>

@101
<en>Just watching her pain is heartbreaking. I rush to sit next her.
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I hope this helps you."
<es>

@103
<en>I touch her back.
<es>

@106
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@107
<en>Mizuki grunts in a snuffle. It seems she feels a bit better with my rubbing.
<es>

@111
<en>{Rin}\n"Simple touching sometimes can make a big difference. Maybe, the human touch has some kind of magic power."
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see."
<es>

@113
<en>That is pretty encouraging to me. There should be something I can do for her then.
<es>

@117
<en>{Mizuki}\n"... ......"
<es>

@118
<en>Mizuki gives me an angry look.
<es>

@119
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Do you find it more fun to talk to Rin than me? Because I am a bleeding, dirty girl now?"
<es>

@120
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about?"
<es>

@125
<en>{Rin}\n"Why are you saying that?"
<es>

@126
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Because..."
<es>

@127
<en>Mizuki looks upset. Even a trivial thing seems to get on her nerve right now. I know sickness makes one act like that.
<es>

@128
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Come on, don't think that way. I love you even though you are a bleeding, dirty girl now."
<es>

@131
<en>{Rin}\n"You see, Mizuki? Kazushi cares no one but you."
<es>

@132
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course!"
<es>

@133
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Looks like you two hit it off well."
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why do you go that way?"
<es>

@135
<en>I guess nothing is going to work with her now. I may as well just agree on everything she says.
<es>

@138
<en>{Rin}\n"I'm gonna go now. I will leave you two alone."
<es>

@139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@140
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you sorry for, Kazushi?"
<es>

@141
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, yes. No worries. Just close your eyes and relax."
<es>

@142
<en>{Mizuki}\n(Mizuki groans.)
<es>

@146
<en>Rin smiles at us.
<es>

@147
<en>{Rin}\n"You're so kind, Kazushi."
<es>

@148
<en>Rin mutters so that I only can hear. I am flushed a bit.
<es>

@150
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Getting sick gets you acting like that --- being selfish, you know. I kind of find her being selfish cute, if it comes only every once in while, of course."
<es>

@152
<en>{Rin}\n"Wow. You sound so matured."
<es>

@153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Heh. Well, I am getting there."
<es>

@156
<en>{Rin}\n"Good for you, Mizuki. I wish I had such an understanding boyfriend like him."
<es>

@157
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You will get one."
<es>

@161
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you two whispering?"
<es>

@163
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, it hurts."
<es>

@164
<en>Mizuki pulls out hairs from my leg. I begin to find it more fun to talk to Rin than Mizuki, once she becomes bitchy.
<es>

@168
<en>{Rin}\n"Hey, Mizuki."
<es>

@170
<en>Thump!
<es>

@171
<en>Rin knocks Mizuki on the head with her fist.
<es>

@175
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ouch..."
<es>

@179
<en>{Rin}\n"I know you are feeling sick. But if you are being so bitchy all the time and give Kazushi a hard time, I will steal him from you."
<es>

@184
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What?"
<es>

@185
<en>Mizuki suddenly gets up from the bed.
<es>

@186
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@187
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Steal from her?"
<es>

@188
<en>Gee...Rin has a feeling for me too...? They say people have the bloom of love once in life. So now is the time?
<es>

@189
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uhh..."
<es>

@192
<en>{Rin}\n"Hey, don't be so serious, I'm just kidding. Truthfully, Kazushi is not really my type."
<es>

@193
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@196
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Really? Whew..."
<es>

@197
<en>It sounded too good to be true... I would not know how to handle two girls at the same time anyway.
<es>

@200
<en>{Rin}\n"Okay, I'm leaving. Take care, guys."
<es>

@202
<en>Rin winks at me and leaves the room.
<es>

@203
<en>Rin certainly has a lot of mischief in character.
<es>

@206
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you looking at?"
<es>

@207
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oops."
<es>

@208
<en>Shit. With no reason, I find myself looking at Rin's way out, which seems to upset Mizuki...
<es>

@211
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, sorry! Rin just chewed me out on this."
<es>

@212
<en>It seems Mizuki feels bad about bitching around and she holds her head with her hands.
<es>

@213
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry, Mizuki. It only comes once a month, right?"
<es>

@216
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You are so kind, Kazushi. I am so bitchy and selfish."
<es>

@217
<en>I notice that her eyes got teary and maybe she is kind of mawkish.
<es>

@218
<en>It's sort of fun to see Mizuki change her emotions so quickly.
<es>

@219
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, lie down."
<es>

@220
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes."
<es>

@222
<en>I lay her down in bed and begin to rub her back.
<es>

@225
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You don't have to do that, Kazushi..."
<es>

@226
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No sweat. Feels better right?"
<es>

@227
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes, it does. But no sex yet, okay?"
<es>

@228
<en>Her body twitches a bit.
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. I will be patient."
<es>

@230
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@231
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't have to apologize. It's just sex."
<es>

@232
<en>But the truth of matter is touching her body is just good enough to make my shaft bigger. So I just have to grin and bear.
<es>

@233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You know what, I don't mind if you are bitchy and selfish a bit."
<es>

@236
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well, I want to eat custard pudding then!"
<es>

@237
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Pudding? Do they carry those here?"
<es>

@238
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I want an ice cream too. Also I want to meet the celebrity."
<es>

@239
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's not possible."
<es>

@240
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I haven't bought a new swimsuit this year yet, so I want the new design of it. Top of that, I want a white, small house on top of the hill overlooking the sea."
<es>

@241
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Getting out of my hand. By the way, white-colored houses are difficult to clean."
<es>

@244
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Never mind...and also I want..."
<es>

@245
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You got more?"
<es>

@248
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I want a kiss..."
<es>

@249
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@250
<en>I didn't get what she said at first.
<es>

@253
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm..."
<es>

@254
<en>Mizuki pushes her lips out.
<es>

@255
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How can I refuse?"
<es>

@256
<en>I nestle Mizuki against me and kiss her.
<es>

@257
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm..."
<es>

@258
<en>Custard pudding will taste better after our kiss...
<es>
