<en>She concluded me!
<es>

@6
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well yea I know that I'm stupid but don't say that in person."
<es>

@9
<en>{Natsume}\n"I see......your starting to look cute Haruma."
<es>

@10
<en>Is it because I'm stupid? It made me feel sad when she kinda treated me like a kid
<es>

@11
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't treat me like a kid infront of everyone."
<es>

@14
<en>{Natsume}\n"You don't want to be treated like a kid? Did your parents treat you like a kid"
<es>

@15
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well yea when I was a kid, how about your parents......"
<es>

@16
<en>I was going to say something but I remembered we just had this conversation about Natsume's father
<es>

@17
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where is your father right now?"
<es>

@18
<en>Where would this guy be? Leaving his cute daughter in this island
<es>

@19
<en>{Natsume}\n"He's in this island."
<es>

@20
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? He's in this island?"
<es>

@21
<en>That was an unexpected answer. Then there shouldn't be any problem.
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then you should be able to see him anytime right?"
<es>

@23
<en>It's an small island, and hell, they live in the same island. They should be able to see each other.
<es>

@26
<en>{Natsume}\n"But, he wouldn't see me."
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wha?Why? You went to go see him right?"
<es>

@28
<en>{Natsume}\n"I did, but he ran away from me."
<es>

@29
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why would he run away? Isn't he your father?"
<es>

@32
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't know, maybe he just hates me."
<es>

@33
<en>Natsume seems to be sulky The usual Natsume always looks like the person who would be on top, but the Natsume that I see rite now is just a ordinarily girl.
<es>

@36
<en>{Natsume}\n"My father hates me. That's why he went away from me. That's why he wouldn't see me even if I went."
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's not true"
<es>

@38
<en>I didn't know the problem between them but, I just had to say that
<es>

@41
<en>{Natsume}\n"What do you know about me, you don't know anything."
<es>

@42
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That is true but, he is your only father. There isn't a father that wouldn't care about their own child."
<es>

@45
<en>{Natsume}\n"Then why wouldn't he see me? Why would he run away?"
<es>

@46
<en>It looked like we were going back in times because Natsume was acting like a little girl
<es>

@47
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wouldn't know that either, but all I can say is that your father loves you."
<es>

@48
<en>{Natsume}\n"......that's a lie"
<es>

@49
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Seriously, I mean it. Let's go see your father one more time, I will go with you this time."
<es>

@52
<en>{Natsume}\n"......your going too Haruno?"
<es>

@53
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yea, I'll go with you this time, and I'll make sure he wont run away so you could see him."
<es>

@57
<en>{Natsume}\n".................."
<es>

@58
<en>Natsume was stalling for awhile. I think she was scared her father might run away again and not see her.
<es>

@59
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry! Believe in me."
<es>

@62
<en>{Natsume}\n"um......okay, this time your going to meet my father too Haruma."
<es>

@63
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right, got it"
<es>

@64
<en>I don't know what kinda parent this guy is but if he was some kinda jerk I would definitely say something
<es>

@65
<en>But, I just can't think this guy is a bad guy because he's Natsume's only father
<es>

@66
<en>I must help them out
<es>
