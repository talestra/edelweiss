<en>{Kazushi}\n *Achoo!!*
<es>

@9
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Damn..."
<es>

@10
<en>Why does one get the urge to curse after sneezing over and over? I know I did.
<es>

@11
<en>{Mizuki}\n"See? You caught a cold."
<es>

@12
<en>Mizuki said though the window.
<es>

@15
<en>I'd been sneezing for a while now. I could tell I'd managed to catch a cold. It was only natural, considering how wet I'd gotten.
<es>

@18
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I told you, didn't I?"
<es>

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry. Did I bother you?"
<es>

@22
<en>His apology ticked her off even more.
<es>

@23
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's not what I'm saying. I'm asking if you caught a cold, Kazushi."
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I'm fine. How about you? Okay?"
<es>

@25
<en>Mizuki didn't know what to say.
<es>

@26
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Who cares? I won't get any better anyway."
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@28
<en>Kazushi became quiet, thinking that was a dumb question. But watching his reaction also hurt Mizuki.
<es>

@29
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Anyway, don't just get drenched like that in my sight. It makes it hard to sleep!"
<es>

@30
<en>Mizuki criticized Kazushi, but he smiled for some reason.
<es>

@31
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I come up there, then?"
<es>

@32
<en>He took his chance and asked if he could come in. Mizuki hesitated.
<es>

@33
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You're mixing things up!"
<es>

@34
<en>Mizuki gave him a blunt refusal. However, Kazushi just wore a wry smile, unfazed by it.
<es>

@35
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see. Then I guess I'll go somewhere until the rain stops."
<es>

@36
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Go do that. And you don't have to come back!"
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But I will."
<es>

@39
<en>Kazushi walked off, waving back at her, soaked like a rat. Mizuki watched his back until he'd walked all the way out of sight.
<es>

@45
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@46
<en>Mizuki woke up in the middle of the night. The afternoon rain had stopped, and her hospital room was frighteningly quiet.
<es>

@47
<en>Ever since the accident, she'd been a bit scared of nights. Or to be more precise, darkness. She felt like she had been trapped in darkness for a while after the accident.
<es>

@48
<en>And when she finally woke up, her legs would no longer move.
<es>

@49
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hahh..."
<es>

@50
<en>With a deep sigh, she rolled back into bed. However, rolling over didn't work like it used to.
<es>

@51
<en>That was irritating, and little things like that left her in despair. She became this way while she was trapped in the darkness.
<es>

@52
<en>That's why even though she knew nothing would happen anymore, she was afraid to sleep. And so her days of poor sleep and restless nights continued.
<es>

@53
<en>But lately, she'd been able to sleep better. It was probably because Kazushi was outside. Yet still, she occasionally woke in the middle of the night like tonight.
<es>

@54
<en>When that happened, she was done for. She felt all alone, as if she were the last person on Earth.
<es>

@55
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm okay...I'm okay."
<es>

@56
<en>She tried to convince herself, yet she had the urge to scream. She was afraid, and her body trembled.
<es>

@57
<en>Why had she pushed everyone away like that when she was so afraid of being alone?
<es>

@58
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Three o'clock, huh?"
<es>

@59
<en>It would still be a few more hours before morning. She might not be able to sleep until dawn.
<es>

@60
<en>She peeked outside through a gap in the curtains. Kazushi wasn't there.
<es>

@61
<en>Mizuki had noticed that Kazushi would disappear somewhere after lights out for a while now.
<es>

@62
<en>She thought he might be going back to the dorm, but he was always outside her window by dawn.
<es>

@63
<en>She sensed that he was heading somewhere else, not the dorm, but she had no idea where.
<es>

@64
<en>Either way, Kazushi wasn't there now. Mizuki was helplessly alone and anxious on nights when she awoke and Kazushi was gone.
<es>

@65
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@66
<en>She tried calling his name. Her weak self thought that she shouldn't have told Kazushi he didn't need to come back.
<es>

@67
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@68
<en>She called his name again.
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n *cough*
<es>

@70
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@71
<en>It was Kazushi's voice. She reached her hand out and widened the gap to peer outside. She could see Kazushi there.
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n *COUGH*
<es>

@75
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe I really am getting sick..."
<es>

@77
<en>Be it the lack of lingering summer heat this year or the island's climate, it was already cold after the first week of September. Just as Mizuki had said, I shouldn't have gotten soaked.
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder if Mizuki is still asleep."
<es>

@80
<en>I stared at her lightless window, wondering if she was sleeping well and having a nice dream.
<es>

@81
<en>{Kazushi}\n"*Cough*...ngh...not good, not good."
<es>

@82
<en>I covered my mouth as I coughed again. I didn't want to be too loud and wake her up.
<es>

@83
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@84
<en>The curtain was slightly drawn back. I could see a glimpse of Mizuki through it.
<es>

@85
<en>Did I wake her up? Or was she already up? I had a feeling it was the latter.
<es>

@86
<en>Mizuki just stared at me.
<es>

@90
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can't sleep?"
<es>

@91
<en>I asked her.
<es>

@92
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I just woke up."
<es>

@93
<en>I knew it. She was already up.
<es>

@94
<en>I know more about Mizuki than anyone else.
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you want me to sing you a lullaby to help you sleep?"
<es>

@96
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, thanks. I'm not a kid. But you're coughing."
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not a big deal. It's just my throat...*cough*......"
<es>

@98
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It is a big deal. You need to sleep in a real bed for once."
<es>

@99
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not a child, so I'm fine. What about you? Did you have a bad dream or something?"
<es>

@100
<en>About the accident?
<es>

@101
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm not a child either. Just having a bad dream doesn't keep me from sleeping."
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure? Why don't you go back to sleep, then?"
<es>

@103
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, I will. You really are gonna catch a cold if you are not careful."
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. I know. Good night!"
<es>

@105
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Good night!"
<es>

@108
<en>Mizuki slammed the window shut, and a heavy silence settled back over her.
<es>

@109
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm not a child."
<es>

@110
<en>But she was afraid of closing her eyes. However, knowing that Kazushi was just outside her window was a bit of a relief.
<es>

@111
<en>{Kazushi}\n *COUGH*
<es>

@112
<en>Another cough. Was Kazushi really coming down with a cold?
<es>

@113
<en>{Kazushi}\n *COUGH*
<es>

@114
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You're so noisy, I can't sleep."
<es>

@115
<en>She muttered to herself. Actually, she was extremely worried about it. She wanted to force him to lie down so she could rub his back.
<es>

@116
<en>But now the distance between them was far too great to do even that. Especially for Mizuki, who'd lost her freedom of movement.
<es>

@117
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@118
<en>She reached out to the window. Kazushi was far away from her. She couldn't even rub his back anymore.
<es>

@119
<en>She thought to herself, "Even if I'm with him, I can't do anything for him. And in that case, it's better for us to be apart, isn't it?"
<es>

@120
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki, are you asleep?"
<es>

@121
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@122
<en>Tears began to fall as she heard Kazushi's voice.
<es>

@124
<en>I felt like Mizuki was crying in her dark room, so I called out to her, but there was no reply.
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm? Is she asleep?"
<es>

@126
<en>I hope she's getting some sleep.
<es>

@127
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizu...*cough*......"
<es>

@128
<en>{Mizuki}\n"*Cough*..."
<es>

@129
<en>I heard her voice...
<es>

@131
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You awake?"
<es>

@132
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, I'm sleeping."
<es>

@133
<en>She couldn't help but reply curtly, because she thought she'd cry if she talked.
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hahaha. You have been awake, haven't you?"
<es>

@135
<en>And yet Kazushi laughed it off, lightening her heart.
<es>

@136
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't sleep if you just keep talking."
<es>

@137
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that's right. Sorry."
<es>

@138
<en>{Mizuki}\n"And your coughing bothers me too."
<es>

@139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@141
<en>So it's me that's keeping her from getting to sleep...
<es>

@142
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry, Mizuki. I'll be quiet."
<es>

@144
<en>Then the clinic door opened, and a nurse came out.
<es>

@145
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? What's wrong?"
<es>

@146
<en>The nurse I knew came up to me with a blanket in her hands.
<es>

@147
<en>{Nurse}\n"Mizuki-chan said to use this."
<es>

@148
<en>The nurse handed it to me with a chuckle.
<es>

@149
<en>{Nurse}\n"And this is some cold medicine."
<es>

@150
<en>{Kazushi}\n"From Mizuki..."
<es>

@151
<en>{Nurse}\n"She called us on emergency button."
<es>

@152
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You don't have to tell him that!"
<es>

@154
<en>She couldn't believe that nurse, running her mouth like that.
<es>

@155
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks."
<es>

@156
<en>I could hear his voice.
<es>

@157
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Your coughing is noisy."
<es>

@158
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I know."
<es>

@159
<en>Yes, Kazushi was probably right. Kazushi probably knew everything. Everything, including that she couldn't be honest with her feelings.
<es>

@160
<en>She hated that fact, but she was also relieved by it.
<es>

@161
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Then I really am going back to sleep now."
<es>

@162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry to bother you, Mizuki. Good night."
<es>

@163
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, good night."
<es>

@164
<en>She pulled the sheets over her head. This time, she was likely to sleep.
<es>

@166
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, Kazushi."
<es>

@167
<en>There was something she wanted to tell him before she did. Something she hadn't been able to say this whole time. Something she thought she could say now.
<es>

@168
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm? What's up?"
<es>

@169
<en>Kazushi sounded a bit sleepy. Were the warm blanket and cold pills working?
<es>

@170
<en>That's perfect. She wanted him to listen as he dozed off.
<es>

@171
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm sorry about the other day."
<es>

@172
<en>She hadn't been able to say that. She had taken it out on Kazushi and everyone else.
<es>

@173
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@174
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure, don't worry about it. Apologize to everyone else too next time."
<es>

@175
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, I will."
<es>

@176
<en>She didn't know if they'd accept it or not, but she would apologize.
<es>

@177
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No worries, Mizuki. They'll understand."
<es>

@178
<en>His drowsy voice gave her comfort.
<es>

@179
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Thanks."
<es>

@180
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Go to sleep, Mizuki. I'm sleepy too."
<es>

@181
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes. Good night."
<es>

@182
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sleep well and stay healthy, Mizuki. Otherwise you won't get your legs fixed."
<es>

@183
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? My legs?"
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I told you. I will cure your legs."
<es>

@185
<en>He sounded half-asleep. He was probably talking in his sleep by now. It wasn't very convincing, hearing it like that.
<es>

@186
<en>But nonetheless, it put Mizuki at ease.
<es>

@187
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Okay. I'll be waiting."
<es>

@188
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, you wait."
<es>

@189
<en>That was his final reply. She could hear him snoring through the window.
<es>

@190
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Good night..."
<es>

@191
<en>Mizuki whispered one last time. Then, with Kazushi's snoring as her lullaby, she drifted off into a relaxing slumber.
<es>

@199
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wowww!!"
<es>

@200
<en>The flask broke into pieces. We failed again!
<es>

@203
<en>{Pierre}\n"Shit! It didn't work at all!!"
<es>

@204
<en>We all tried refinements in many different ways, but weren't getting any results. We knew it wasn't going to be easy, but we were all getting frustrated.
<es>

@208
<en>{Haruka}\n"Maybe it's too difficult for us to do it... What do you think, Mei-chan?"
<es>

@213
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, it is difficult - no question about that."
<es>

@214
<en>Mei-sensei nodded with a serious look. She didn't give us any consolation. That's how harsh this situation was.
<es>

@215
<en>{Mei}\n"I heard about Hinata-san's legs from Miya-san. He said her legs were damaged to the point that their shape was nearly gone."
<es>

@216
<en>Mizuki's injuries were so bad that these girls looked away just from hearing about it. The reason they didn't look that way was thanks to Miya-san's alchemy.
<es>

@217
<en>{Mei}\n"Miya-san restored her legs, but only on the surface. He couldn't bring life to them, so to speak."
<es>

@218
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Life?"
<es>

@219
<en>{Mei}\n"In other words, though her legs look fine, they are already 'dead'."
<es>

@220
<en>I knew that much from seeing her every day.
<es>

@221
<en>Mizuki's legs couldn't move at all, and they didn't even look like part of her body.
<es>

@222
<en>That was how foreign they looked. They were attached to her body, but they gave the impression that blood wasn't flowing through them.
<es>

@225
<en>{Mei}\n"In order to cure Hinata-san's life, we need a technique close to the 'creation' or 'resuscitation' of life. I don't think I need to explain how difficult that is."
<es>

@230
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Resuscitation of life..."
<es>

@231
<en>The skills to bring the dead back to life. Yes, it sure does sound very difficult to do.
<es>

@232
<en>So what we are trying to do is an extremely difficult task.
<es>

@237
<en>{Mei}\n"It seems Miya-san is thinking of passing a 'core' through those legs to make them artificial legs in the worst scenario. Since they are her legs, they'll at least look good."
<es>

@239
<en>They're perfect for artificial legs, in other words. As a girl, Mizuki should care about how her legs looked, so such a way may be the best way as the last resort.
<es>

@240
<en>But no matter how difficult it may be, I want to bring life back to her legs.
<es>

@241
<en>I want her to be able to swim with the dolphins once again. I want her to make her dreams of swimming in waters all around the world come true.
<es>

@242
<en>Is that wish asking for too much?
<es>

@246
<en>{Appo}\n"I don't understand all this theoretical stuff. We just have to do it, right?"
<es>

@247
<en>Appo's happy-go-lucky personality broke the bleak atmosphere.
<es>

@252
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah, our grades are on the low side, so we won't know until we try."
<es>

@259
<en>{Daigo}\n"I was in the 30th percentile though."
<es>

@263
<en>{Ran}\n"30? That's low."
<es>

@266
<en>{Appo}\n"I understand it's difficult. So no matter how difficult it is, let's just keep trying what we can."
<es>

@267
<en>{Daigo}\n"If you don't swing the bat, you'll never hit the ball. If you swing the bat, you might at least hit it by accident."
<es>

@271
<en>{Pierre}\n"If her legs can really move, it doesn't matter whether it's a miracle or what..."
<es>

@275
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow, just the lines you'd expect from dumb kids. It's like positivity's all they have."
<es>

@278
<en>{Appo}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@282
<en>{Fuusen}\n"But there's no point in being pessimistic. It feels good to have a positive attitude."
<es>

@289
<en>{Sakura}\n"And that'll lead to better results too, I'm sure."
<es>

@291
<en>Everyone was gaining enthusiasm.\nYes, we can!\nThere's nothing to back that up, but we have to stay positive.
<es>

@297
<en>{Haruka}\n".................."
<es>

@298
<en>Among them, Haruka seemed to be contemplating something.
<es>

@299
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's up, Haruka?"
<es>

@302
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yeah, something caught my mind. Mei-chan, you just said we need a technique close to the 'creation' or 'resuscitation' of life, right?"
<es>

@303
<en>Does anything ring a bell? I wonder...
<es>

@308
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, I did. What about it?"
<es>

@309
<en>{Haruka}\n"That means the same techniques used to create a homunculus, right?"
<es>

@310
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Homunculus?"
<es>

@311
<en>What does that mean? It sounded familiar...
<es>

@316
<en>{Fuusen}\n"A homunculus is an artificial life-form. It's created from scratch by people, and possesses the same intelligence as people."
<es>

@321
<en>{Appo}\n"What the hell is that? Can we really do it?"
<es>

@326
<en>{Mei}\n"I know there are people researching homunculi, but I've never heard of anybody being successful."
<es>

@327
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Artificial life..."
<es>

@328
<en>If such a thing is really possible, making her legs move shouldn't be that difficult.
<es>

@334
<en>{Haruka}\n"Homonculus research was conducted at this academy long ago."
<es>

@335
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@336
<en>Her serious, grave voice echoed quietly throughout the room. It took us a few moments to understand. Homonculi were researched at this academy?
<es>

@337
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Somebody was studying how to create a homunculus here?"
<es>

@342
<en>{Mei}\n"I've heard of it before, but I wasn't sure if it was true. The rumors were true then?"
<es>

@343
<en>Even Mei-sensei didn't know much about it. Haruka looked very serious.
<es>

@344
<en>There was no reason for Haruka to lie about it either.
<es>

@347
<en>{Haruka}\n"It was before you came to the island, Mei-sensei."
<es>

@348
<en>How did Haruka know about this? Did anyone tell her?
<es>

@349
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who knows about homunculi, then?"
<es>

@352
<en>{Haruka}\n"My grandma."
<es>

@355
<en>{Mei}\n"The principal..."
<es>

@356
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So if we can get her help, maybe we can make it happen?"
<es>

@357
<en>If the principal who studied homunculi could help us with our effort, we may be able to cure Mizuki's legs...
<es>

@360
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't think it will be that easy. Magic operates under the principal of equivalent exchange. To give birth to a life, we need something of equal value."

<en>To get Mizuki's legs back, we need to find something of equal value?
<es>

@362
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Take my legs if you need them! If that's not enough, then take my life too! I want Mizuki to have her legs back!"
<es>

@363
<en>I'll give up whatever I have to for her! So...
<es>

@364
<en>{Mei}\n"Haruma-kun, calm down. Equivalent exchange means we only need something of equal value, not the exact same thing."
<es>

@369
<en>{Appo}\n"Hmm? So? What does it mean?"
<es>

@374
<en>{Fuusen}\n"A leg for a leg, a life for a life... it doesn't always have to follow that formula."
<es>

@378
<en>{Ran}\n"Right? Otherwise you'd need money to make money, and that would be nonsense."
<es>

@379
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good point... but then what do we need?"
<es>

@380
<en>I will supply anything if it can restore Mizuki's legs.
<es>

@381
<en>{Fuusen}\n"She was trying to create a homunculus, right? So there should be something."
<es>

@386
<en>{Haruka}\n".................."
<es>

@387
<en>Everyone stared at Haruka, waiting for her answer. A heavy silence enveloped her. She was earnestly trying to think of something.
<es>

@388
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka, anything will help. Could you tell us if there's anything you can think of?"
<es>

@391
<en>{Haruka}\n"Well... there's a stone that Grandma has been searching for for a long time. If we find that stone, then maybe..."
<es>

@392
<en>Haruka spoke hestitantly, searching for the words.\nA stone that the principal's been looking for?
<es>

@393
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What kind of..."
<es>

@394
<en>{Haruka}\n"If we were able to use that stone, we might produce something we haven't yet. But we've never been able to find that stone."
<es>

@395
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So if we uncover that stone..."
<es>

@398
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yes. There might be a possibility..."
<es>

@399
<en>Haruka's explanation was a bit roundabout, but it gave us plenty of hope. There might be a way for us to break though this no-way-out situation.
<es>

@405
<en>{Mei}\n"The question is, where's the stone?"
<es>

@406
<en>{Fuusen}\n"The principal may know something."
<es>

@410
<en>{Pierre}\n"Why don't we just go ask her, then?"
<es>

@411
<en>However, Haruka shook her head hesitantly.
<es>

@416
<en>{Haruka}\n"Even if she knew, I don't think she'd tell us... My grandma has a great dream, and she's been planning to use the stone to make it come true."
<es>

@417
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So that stone..."
<es>

@418
<en>{Haruka}\n"Even if we find it, she may not let us use it. But it's also true that it's the only way I can think of..."
<es>

@419
<en>A grave atmosphere gathered all around. It might be the only way to cure Mizuki's legs, but it'll be impossible to try.
<es>

@423
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, we had better find that stone before the principal does."
<es>

@428
<en>{Rin}\n"Is that alright? The principal needs it too, right?"
<es>

@432
<en>{Sakura}\n"But we can't think of anything else, can we?"
<es>

@437
<en>{Appo}\n"What are you gonna do, Kazushi? If you want to do it, we'll be there at your side."
<es>

@442
<en>{Daigo}\n"Yeah."
<es>

@449
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's right. It's up to you, Kazushi."
<es>

@450
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm..."
<es>

@454
<en>That stone must be very important to the principal. She was planning to use it to make her dream come true one day.
<es>

@455
<en>No matter what the reason, stealing that stone away from her... is something we shouldn't do. But still... we need it for Mizuki.
<es>

@456
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will talk to the principal."
<es>

@457
<en>Then all we can do is be frank and ask her. My decision was made.
<es>

@460
<en>{Ran}\n"That's a very important stone for her too, right? Will she really let you use something that important?"
<es>

@461
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's why we can't just take it without asking. Mizuki wouldn't be happy, even if we did."
<es>

@466
<en>{Rin}\n"I agree. Mizuki would not be happy if she found out about it."
<es>

@467
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's why I'll go talk to her."
<es>

@472
<en>{Haruka}\n"Okay. I'll go with you."
<es>

@473
<en>Haruka looked up at me with determined eyes.
<es>

@474
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? It'll be a big help if you do."
<es>

@475
<en>Going to ask her together with her granddaughter will make a better impression than just going alone.
<es>

@480
<en>{Mei}\n"I'll go too. Let me ask her myself as well."
<es>

@485
<en>{Daigo}\n"Why don't we all go there together, then? The more the better, right?"
<es>

@490
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah, that's right! A big group may scare her into saying yes, you know."
<es>

@494
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Hey, we're not trying to scare her or anything. I'm a bit worried, so I'll go too."
<es>

@499
<en>{Haruka}\n"Then let's all ask her together. Grandma may understand our feelings better if we all ask her as one."
<es>

@500
<en>Everyone was charged up to go. They were willing to help me without a second thought. They were going to help me and Mizuki.
<es>

@501
<en>It was so encouraging.
<es>

@502
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks, guys."
<es>

@503
<en>Everything is going to be fine, Mizuki. Your friends are here to help you, so you will definitely get your legs back.
<es>

@504
<en>I will make it happen.
<es>

@511
<en>{Principal}\n".................."
<es>

@512
<en>The atmosphere was heavier than I expected. We said what we had to say as best we could. Now we were just awaiting her answer...
<es>

@513
<en>{Principal}\n".................."
<es>

@514
<en>The principal remained silent, glaring at us like a hawk.
<es>

@515
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm, Principal..."
<es>

@516
<en>{Principal}\n"Is that all you had to say?"
<es>

@517
<en>She opened her mouth. It didn't sound very good.
<es>

@518
<en>{Principal}\n"Haruka, you were the one who ran their mouth, weren't you?"
<es>

@519
<en>The principal gave Haruka a sharp look.
<es>

@524
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yes. It's because that's the only thing I could think of."
<es>

@525
<en>{Principal}\n"So what? You expect me to give up everything I've worked for just because you want your friend's legs cured?"
<es>

@528
<en>The principal gave a bitter look and some harsh words to Haruka, who looked down and waited patiently for her grandmother to continue.
<es>

@529
<en>{Haruka}\n"......Yes."
<es>

@530
<en>She said in a feeble, trembling voice.
<es>

@531
<en>{Principal}\n"What?"
<es>

@534
<en>{Haruka}\n"I said, yes."
<es>

@535
<en>Haruka stared at her grandmother.
<es>

@536
<en>{Haruka}\n"You have to let go, Grandma. You've done so much. Please stop blaming yourself."
<es>

@537
<en>Haruka tried speaking to the principal in a different tone of voice. There must have been some hidden meaning to her words that we didn't know about.
<es>

@538
<en>Haruka and the principal looked at each other. The rest of us felt a sudden change of atmosphere as we nervously watched over them both.
<es>

@539
<en>{Principal}\n"How dare you speak as if you understand. I don't want to hear any more about this. Everyone, please leave."
<es>

@542
<en>The principal spun her chair and turned her back on us.
<es>

@543
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please wait! We really need the stone's power for Mizuki!"
<es>

@546
<en>{Principal}\n"You do?"
<es>

@547
<en>The principal kept her back to us as she spoke in a frightening tone. She only turned her head, scoffing at us.
<es>

@550
<en>{Principal}\n"What's wrong with losing a leg or two? Her life was saved, and she should be grateful for it. Don't make such a big deal out of this."
<es>

@551
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What did you say?"
<es>

@552
<en>Her comments provoked me to anger. A dark aura was emanating from her back, and the office grew even more tense.
<es>

@557
<en>{Haruka}\n"Grandma, don't say things like that, and Kazushi-kun, calm down."
<es>

@558
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I understand."
<es>

@559
<en>Yes, I know I have to calm down. I have to control myself.
<es>

@560
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please take back what you just said."
<es>

@563
<en>{Principal}\n"There is no such need. Don't bother me with such a trivial matter."
<es>

@564
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@569
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi, calm down!"
<es>

@573
<en>{Principal}\n"That stone is the source of all the power that this island possesses. You must use it for the greater good - not such a trifling thing."
<es>

@574
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A trifling thing?"
<es>

@575
<en>I was about to blow my top.
<es>

@579
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, wait, Kazushi!"
<es>

@584
<en>By the time Pierre shouted, I had already leapt over the desk and reached out to gr...
<es>

@586
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What the--!?"
<es>

@587
<en>I was about to grab a hold of the principal, but my hand swung through the air. The principal disappeared before my eyes.
<es>

@590
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Gwah!!"
<es>

@591
<en>I lost my balance and crashed against the wall behind the principal's chair. Once I hit the floor, I turned around.
<es>

@592
<en>Then I looked up and found the principal staring down at me with a frightening grimace on her face.
<es>

@593
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You son of a...!!"
<es>

@594
<en>She flickered in and out of visibility.
<es>

@595
<en>What the hell is going on? I don't even know where to direct my anger!\n...Shit, now I can't move!
<es>

@598
<en>{Principal}\n"Get out."
<es>

@599
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Khh..."
<es>

@600
<en>I was frustrated, but I couldn't get up.
<es>

@604
<en>{Daigo}\n"Are you okay?"
<es>

@605
<en>Daigo helped me stand. My head was still spinning while Haruka stood up in front of me to confront the principal.
<es>

@609
<en>{Haruka}\n"Grandma, can you please think it over?"
<es>

@610
<en>Haruka's voice was sad, but the principal looked away from Haruka, paying her no heed.
<es>

@614
<en>{Principal}\n"No more, Haruka, or you too will be sorry."
<es>

@618
<en>{Haruka}\n"Okay... I got it."
<es>

@619
<en>Haruka gave up and left the principal's office. She looked very sad as she left.
<es>

@620
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka..."
<es>

@621
<en>{Haruka}\n"Let's go, Kazushi-kun. She won't listen."
<es>

@625
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Yeah. We will be back."
<es>

@626
<en>The rest of the guys nodded in agreement. No other choices, huh...
<es>

@627
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......Okay."
<es>

@629
<en>I left the principal's room while Daigo and Appo held me up.
<es>

@630
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not gonna give up."
<es>

@631
<en>I couldn't leave without saying it.
<es>

@634
<en>{Principal}\n".................."
<es>

@635
<en>The principal made hard eye contact with me and I stared back at her. Normally that look would've made me want to run away, but I looked right back.
<es>

@636
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will never give up."
<es>

@637
<en>{Principal}\n"...Get out."
<es>

@641
<en>{Daigo}\n"Let's go."
<es>

@642
<en>I left the room with assistance. I won't give up, no matter what!
<es>

@649
<en>{Pierre}\n"What that hell was that?"
<es>

@654
<en>{Appo}\n"I was shocked. All of a sudden, she disappeared."
<es>

@658
<en>{Sakura}\n"When Harucchi tried to jump onto her, right? It looks like the principal disappeared in a split second."
<es>

@659
<en>So they also saw the same thing. It wasn't my imagination.
<es>

@663
<en>{Rin}\n"Is she a ninja?"
<es>

@664
<en>{Sakura}\n"It must be an act of alchemy."
<es>

@669
<en>{Haruka}\n"Don't get overwhelmed by this, everyone. That's just a childish trick."
<es>

@670
<en>Haruka was still upset. It seemed like she was ready to face off with the principal again.
<es>

@674
<en>{Mei}\n"We're completely stuck here..."
<es>

@675
<en>She was right. The only hope we had was now effectively cut off.
<es>

@679
<en>{Appo}\n"You're just backing off like that?"
<es>

@680
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No..."
<es>

@681
<en>I can't give up now. No, I won't give up.
<es>

@686
<en>{Pierre}\n"It seems like the principal won't let you get the stone. What are you gonna do?"
<es>

@687
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@688
<en>The stone is the only chance I have, so I can't give up on it. At the same time, I can't cause these guys any more trouble.
<es>

@689
<en>With the principal denying us that strongly, any further acts will be defiance. I can't get them involved in my fight with the principal.
<es>

@694
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi-kun, let's do it."
<es>

@695
<en>Haruka said it decisively. Her voice surprised me a bit because it didn't sound like her - it was quite manly.
<es>

@696
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do what?"
<es>

@697
<en>{Haruka}\n"The stone's power should be used for Mizuki, not Grandma, so please don't give up."
<es>

@698
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What about the principal's dream?"
<es>

@699
<en>The principal's was Haruka's grandmother. Wasn't that dream important to her?
<es>

@702
<en>{Haruka}\n"Grandma's dream is not something I admire. She's been hanging onto this dream for too many years. She's held captive by it."
<es>

@705
<en>{Haruka}\n"I want to help Grandma get out of there, Kazushi-kun. I want you to use the stone for Mizuki and end this."
<es>

@706
<en>Haruka gave me a determined look. I didn't know exactly what was going on between her and the principal, but I could see her sincerity.
<es>

@707
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay."
<es>

@708
<en>I nodded affirmatively.
<es>

@711
<en>{Haruka}\n"Thanks."
<es>

@712
<en>Then Haruka smiled at me. I don't know their circumstances, but if Haruka says it's right, I'll believe in her.
<es>

@713
<en>This is for Mizuki, and maybe the principal as well. I'm determined to use the stone for Mizuki.
<es>

@717
<en>{Ran}\n"But what are you going to do? You don't even know where the stone is, do you?"
<es>

@722
<en>{Daigo}\n"The principal is also looking for it, right? It may be hard to get ahead."
<es>

@726
<en>{Rin}\n"She's a ninja, too."
<es>

@730
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Any clues as to its whereabouts?"
<es>

@734
<en>{Haruka}\n"No idea. Grandma's been looking for it everywhere."
<es>

@735
<en>{Haruka}\n"But the stone was first discovered inside a cave that's now in the school basement."
<es>

@736
<en>{Haruka}\n"Right now, it's right under the experiment ward. That's the center of this academy, and it's probably best to check there first."
<es>

@737
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Or instead, maybe we should..."
<es>

@740
<en>I got everyone's eyes looking at me. We can't think in an overcomplicated way, so...
<es>

@741
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...seize the whole building!"
<es>

@747
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki!"
<es>

@748
<en>Mizuki was looking out her window from up in bed and shifted her eyes over at me.
<es>

@751
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, uhh..."
<es>

@752
<en>She looked a bit confused.
<es>

@753
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that's right."
<es>

@754
<en>It's been a while since I'd last come to see her in her room, and besides, we hadn't really made up yet.
<es>

@755
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Umm, I, uhh..."
<es>

@756
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Never mind. We'll talk later.\nWe need to get going."
<es>

@757
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Going where?"
<es>

@758
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The crutches...no. The wheelchair...no, too troublesome. Get on my back."
<es>

@759
<en>I kneeled down and motioned for Mizuki to climb on my back.
<es>

@760
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hold on, where are we going? I can't move my legs and I'm only wearing my pyjamas. Going outside is..."
<es>

@761
<en>Mizuki hesitated.
<es>

@762
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Agh, what a pain. I'm kidnapping you now."
<es>

@764
<en>I pulled Mizuki's pillowcase over her head.
<es>

@768
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? No, wai...MMMMMFFFGH?!"
<es>

@774
<en>{Principal}\n"What? The experiment ward has been seized!?"
<es>

@779
<en>{Yagami}\n"Yes, that's what they're insisting."
<es>

@780
<en>{Principal}\n"Who are they?"
<es>

@783
<en>{Yagami}\n"They are... a group of students."
<es>

@786
<en>{Principal}\n"Hmph. I understand. ......Damn kids."
<es>

@793
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What that hell are you thinking!?"
<es>

@794
<en>Mizuki was pretty livid about having been carried to school while wrapped up in her nightgown and sheets.
<es>

@795
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry, but because you were grumbling..."
<es>

@796
<en>I calmed her down and got her seated.
<es>

@797
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't believe you would do something like this to your most beloved. Are you sure you still love me?"
<es>

@798
<en>She got sulky while the others giggled at us.
<es>

@801
<en>{Ran}\n"There you guys go again - a lover's quarrel. How stupid."
<es>

@806
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Don't get so upset over it. I understand, though."
<es>

@810
<en>{Haruka}\n"Mizuki-chan, Kazushi-kun, you guys really love each other, huh?"
<es>

@814
<en>{Sakura}\n"Doesn't this make us look like clowns? You know what, why don't we just go with that plan where Harucchi becomes Mizuki's legs?"
<es>

@819
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@820
<en>Now that Mizuki realized everyone was around, she blushed. She should've kept her eyes open in the first place.
<es>

@823
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh, umm, guys..."
<es>

@824
<en>Mizuki spoke slowly and timidly.
<es>

@825
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Umm, I'm very sorry for what I said...the other day..."
<es>

@826
<en>Mizuki feebly bowed her head, but everyone else looked dumbfounded.
<es>

@831
<en>{Haruka}\n"What are you sorry for?"
<es>

@832
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? What? You know... When you all came to see me, I..."
<es>

@836
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh yeah, you were yelling about something. Look here's the deal: We'll forgive you for 500 yen."
<es>

@841
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? 500 yen? Kazushi?"
<es>

@842
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? I'm paying?"
<es>

@845
<en>{Ran}\n"Hurry up and pay it or we won't forgive you."
<es>

@846
<en>{Kazushi}\n"O-okay..."
<es>

@847
<en>They took my 500 yen... Why me?
<es>

@850
<en>{Ran}\n"Thank you. Now we'll put it all behind us."
<es>

@855
<en>{Fuusen}\n"What are you doing taking the lead and 500 yen for yourself, Ran? We were never mad at you in the first place."
<es>

@858
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Not angry? But I said pretty nasty things to you guys..."

<en>{Haruka}\n"We didn't mind that. You're going through some tough times yourself, Mizuki."
<es>

@866
<en>{Pierre}\n"We'll be fixing your legs soon, Mizuki."
<es>

@869
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Fix my legs?"
<es>

@870
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's right. You'll be able to walk and swim again."
<es>

@871
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Swim again?"
<es>

@875
<en>{Appo}\n"With the help of alchemy."
<es>

@878
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No... You guys can't do that. Even Miya-san, an expert on alchemy, couldn't cure my legs."
<es>

@881
<en>Mizuki sounds a bit depressed. She must have remembered when she first heard about her legs.
<es>

@882
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I really appreciated Miya-san's help because he restored my legs this beautifully after they were completely smashed."
<es>

@883
<en>But to me, her legs were nothing but fake, despite looking beautiful with no scars or anything on them.
<es>

@884
<en>But Mizuki needed legs that would enable her to walk and swim like ordinary people.
<es>

@885
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No worries. This is gonna work, and everyone's here for you."
<es>

@886
<en>Everyone gave Mizuki a warm and gentle look.
<es>

@889
<en>{Haruka}\n"We don't know how far we can go, but we will do the best we can."
<es>

@890
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Haruka..."
<es>

@895
<en>{Fuusen}\n"I'll help too, and when it comes down to it, Haruma-kun'll think of something. That's what boyfriends are for."
<es>

@898
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazuko..."
<es>

@901
<en>{Fuusen}\n"I want to see you swim and splash through the water once again, Mizuki-chan."
<es>

@905
<en>{Sakura}\n"Me too! Her swimming totally naked is quite the tantalizing picture, isn't it?"
<es>

@908
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Totally naked? How come you know that too, Sakura?"
<es>

@911
<en>{Sakura}\n"Because I was always peeking on you."
<es>

@912
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What?"
<es>

@913
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey now, don't come out right now."
<es>

@917
<en>{Rin}\n"I'm in charge of food. I'll fix a lot of good things for you, so eat well and get better, okay?"
<es>

@920
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Rin...yes, I will eat a lot."
<es>

@924
<en>{Ran}\n"I can't cook, and I don't think me being here will be much help, but hey."
<es>

@925
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, I'm happy. Thank you, everyone."
<es>

@930
<en>Mizuki pressed her face against my shoulder.
<es>

@931
<en>She wanted to hide her crying.
<es>

@932
<en>Everyone gave her a warm smile.
<es>

@933
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't cry. They're watching."
<es>

@934
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm not... *sniff*"
<es>

@935
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Alright, then Ran, the self-proclaimed useless person, you're in charge of making Mizuki have fun by telling her ten funny jokes every day."
<es>

@938
<en>{Ran}\n"What kind of haphazardly assigned high-grade task is that? I can't believe you'd say that to your ex-lover."
<es>

@941
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Ex-lover?"
<es>

@942
<en>Mizuki becomes flushed - not with embarrassment, but anger.
<es>

@943
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wh-what do you mean ex-lover?! I've never been your lover, Ran!"
<es>

@946
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, right. Keeping it that way is best for not rocking the boat, isn't it."
<es>

@947
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You already shook it up!"
<es>

@950
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I-I don't if it's in the past, but... could you please be honest with me and tell me what happened between you?"
<es>

@951
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There is nothing to tell you!"
<es>

@954
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Did you do something you can't tell me about!?"
<es>

@956
<en>Mizuki completely erupted! It was hard to imagine she'd suffered an incurable injury.
<es>

@957
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Is that something you did to me?! Or something you haven't done yet?"
<es>

@960
<en>{Fuusen}\n"What exactly did you two do and not do? I'm very interested."
<es>

@965
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, guys! Focus! Don't forget that we've barricaded ourselves in the lab!"
<es>

@968
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Barricaded? We are?"
<es>

@969
<en>Mizuki stopped hitting me over and over as she became dumbfounded.
<es>

@970
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. You didn't notice?"
<es>

@974
<en>{Yagami}\n"You're surrounded!! Come out with your hands up!!"
<es>

@977
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@980
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Now it's started."
<es>

@981
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? How did you not notice?"
<es>

@982
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You never told me!"
<es>

@983
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I didn't?"
<es>

@989
<en>{Yagami}\n"You're surrounded!! ......Okay, quit making me say stupid things! If you come out now, you'll get away with just a round-trip slap to the face!"
<es>

@994
<en>{Principal}\n"How is it going?"
<es>

@997
<en>{Yagami}\n"No luck, they won't come out. I guess they're serious."
<es>

@998
<en>{Principal}\n"What easygoing kids. They don't know how important that facility is to our academy."
<es>

@999
<en>{Yagami}\n"Yes, but they are just kids..."
<es>

@1000
<en>{Principal}\n"......That's enough. I'm going in to drag them out."
<es>

@1002
<en>{Yagami}\n"Drag them out? ...Hey, Principal?"
<es>

@1008
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, the principal is coming!"
<es>

@1009
<en>Pierre shouted from where he was keeping watch.
<es>

@1010
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The principal herself?"
<es>

@1011
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah, she's coming in through the main entrance."
<es>

@1012
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The main entrance? Isn't that locked?"
<es>

@1013
<en>{Pierre}\n"Ah! She has a ring of keys!!"
<es>

@1014
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right! The principal probably had a set of spares! What do we do?!"
<es>

@1017
<en>{Pierre}\n"What are we gonna do now?"
<es>

@1018
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@1019
<en>We saw someone stand blocking the principal's way. It was...
<es>

@1020
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan!"
<es>

@1026
<en>{Principal}\n"Get out of my way."
<es>

@1027
<en>{Natsume}\n"No. You shall not pass."
<es>

@1028
<en>{Principal}\n"That's not like you. Why are you going this far?"
<es>

@1029
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma is looking for something. No one is allowed to enter until he finds it."
<es>
