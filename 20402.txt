<en>{Kazushi}\n"Achoo!!"
<es>

@9
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Damn..."
<es>

@10
<en>That's big one...My nose itches...
<es>

@11
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You got a cold now."
<es>

@12
<en>Mizuki says out of the window.
<es>

@15
<en>I keep sneezing. Maybe I'm coming down with a cold since I was out in the rain getting all wet.
<es>

@18
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I told you, didn't I?"
<es>

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry. Did I bother you?"
<es>

@22
<en>Kazushi's apology worsens Mizuki's feelings.
<es>

@23
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Did you hear what I said? You're getting sick!"
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I'm fine. How about you? Okay?"
<es>

@25
<en>Mizuki didn't know what to say.
<es>

@26
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Who cares? I won't get any better anyway."
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@28
<en>Kazushi became quiet thinking that was a dumb question. By watching his reaction,Mizuki also felt hurt.
<es>

@29
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Anyway, don't just get wet like that in my sight. I can't sleep!"
<es>

@30
<en>Mizuki criticizes Kazushi, but he smiles -- for some reason.
<es>

@31
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I come there then?"
<es>

@32
<en>Nice tactics, I felt. Mizuki looks confused.
<es>

@33
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You are mixing things up!"
<es>

@34
<en>Mizuki gives him a blunt refusal. However, Kazushi still smiles bitterly.
<es>

@35
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay. I will go and hide somewhere while it's raining then."
<es>

@36
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Don't you ever come back!"
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, I do."
<es>

@39
<en>Kazushi walks off, waving his hands. Mizuki looks at his back all the way until he is not seen.
<es>

@45
<en>{Mizuki}\n".................."
<es>

@46
<en>Mizuki wakes up in the middle of night. It stopped raining and a hush falls over her room.
<es>

@47
<en>Since the accident, I have been scared of nights. In fact, I have been afraid of darkness. I feel I have been trapped by the dark.
<es>

@48
<en>When I wake up, I find myself not being able to move my legs.
<es>

@49
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh..."
<es>

@50
<en>With a deep sigh, I tumble in bed. However, I do it in a rather awkward way.
<es>

@51
<en>Small things like that discourage me. I feel being locked up in darkness.
<es>

@52
<en>I know nothing scary is going to happen any more. However, I still feel frightened of sleeping. I have not been able to sleep for a while.
<es>

@53
<en>But Nowadays I can sleep better. Is it because of Kazushi being outside? And yet, I still wake up in the middle of night like tonight.
<es>

@54
<en>Then I feel depressed, so lonely. I feel like being completely alone in the whole world.
<es>

@55
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm okay...I'm okay."
<es>

@56
<en>I am trying to encourage myself. But then, I find myself screaming out for help. I tremble with fear.
<es>

@57
<en>I have no idea why I pushed everyone away, while I feel so afraid of being alone.
<es>

@58
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's three o'clock."
<es>

@59
<en>It's still a few hours away until morning. I guess I won't be able to sleep until dawn.
<es>

@60
<en>I look through the window. Kazushi is not there.
<es>

@61
<en>Mizuki notices that Kazushi leaves every night when the lights go off in her room.
<es>

@62
<en>And Kazushi returns right before dawn. Does he go back to his dorm?
<es>

@63
<en>It seems he goes to some place else. I have no idea where.
<es>

@64
<en>Kazushi is not here now. Mizuki feels sad and extremely scared when she wakes up when Kazushi is not around.
<es>

@65
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@66
<en>Calling his name, Mizuki feels sorry for herself having told him not to come here any more.
<es>

@67
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@68
<en>She calls his name again.
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Kazushi coughs."
<es>

@70
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@71
<en>It's Kazushi! I reach my hand over to the window curtain and peer through the barely parted curtain. Kazushi is there!!
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Kazushi coughs hard."
<es>

@75
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe, I'm really getting sick."
<es>

@77
<en>It's getting cold here once September kicks in. Like Mizuki said, maybe it was a bad idea I was outside, sopping wet.
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder Mizuki is still asleep."
<es>

@80
<en>I stare at her window. Are you having a good dream, Mizuki?
<es>

@81
<en>{Kazushi}\n"He coughs hard."
<es>

@82
<en>I cover my mouth not to wake her up.
<es>

@83
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@84
<en>The curtain draws a bit and Mizuki looks out.
<es>

@85
<en>Did I wake her up? Or has she been already up?
<es>

@86
<en>Mizuki just stares at me.
<es>

@90
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can't sleep?"
<es>

@91
<en>I ask her.
<es>

@92
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I just woke up."
<es>

@93
<en>I knew it. She has been up already.
<es>

@94
<en>I know about Mizuki more than anyone else.
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If you can't sleep, do you want me to sing a lullaby for you?"
<es>

@96
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No thanks. But you are coughing."
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not a big deal. It's just my throat...cough......"
<es>

@98
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You have to sleep in bed."
<es>

@99
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not a child, so I'm fine. Did you get a bad dream or something?"
<es>

@100
<en>About the accident?
<es>

@101
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm not a child either. Just having a bad dream doesn't keep me from sleeping."
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure? Why don't you go back to sleep then."
<es>

@103
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, I will. You are really gonna catch a cold if you are not careful."
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. I know. Good night!"
<es>

@105
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Good night!"
<es>

@108
<en>Mizuki slams the window, which puts Mizuki back to a heavy atmosphere in the room.
<es>

@109
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm not a child."
<es>

@110
<en>I'm scared to close my eyes. But I feel a bit encouraged to just know Kazushi is right there over the window.
<es>

@111
<en>{Kazushi}\nKazushi coughs.
<es>

@112
<en>Is Kazushi okay? Is he not coming down with a cold?
<es>

@113
<en>{Kazushi}\n"He coughs hard."
<es>

@114
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's so noisy."
<es>

@115
<en>I complain -- and worry so much about him. I wish I could attend to him.
<es>

@116
<en>But the distance between him and me is too far, especially for Mizuki, who is now physically challenged.
<es>

@117
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@118
<en>I reach over to the window. It feels like Kazushi being far away from me. I can even rub his back.
<es>

@119
<en>Even if I am with him, I can't do anything for him. It's just better for us to be apart.
<es>

@120
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki, are you asleep?"
<es>

@121
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@122
<en>Listening Kazushi's voice, tears begin to be shed.
<es>

@124
<en>I feel Mizuki is sobbing in her dark room. So I call her name, but there is no answer.
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm? Gone asleep?"
<es>

@126
<en>If you can sleep okay...
<es>

@127
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizu...cough......"
<es>

@128
<en>{Mizuki}\n"cough..."
<es>

@129
<en>I hear her voice...
<es>

@131
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You awake?"
<es>

@132
<en>{Mizuki}\n"...No, I was asleep."
<es>

@133
<en>I can't help but reply with a curt.
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hahaha. You have been awake, haven't you?"
<es>

@135
<en>And yet, Kazushi laughs it out, which lightens up a bit.
<es>

@136
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I can't sleep if you just keep talking."
<es>

@137
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah, that's right. Sorry."
<es>

@138
<en>{Mizuki}\n"And your coughing bothers me too."
<es>

@139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@141
<en>So, it's me that keeps her from getting to sleep.
<es>

@142
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry, Mizuki. I will be quiet."
<es>

@144
<en>Then a nurse comes out of the building.
<es>

@145
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hi, what is the matter?"
<es>

@146
<en>The nurse I know comes up to me with a blanket in her hands.
<es>

@147
<en>{Nurse}\n"This is from Mizuki."
<es>

@148
<en>The nurse hands it to me with a chuckle.
<es>

@149
<en>{Nurse}\n"And this - a cold relief."
<es>

@150
<en>{Kazushi}\n"From Mizuki..."
<es>

@151
<en>{Nurse}\n"She called us on emergency button."
<es>

@152
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You don't have to tell him that!"
<es>

@154
<en>God! She is a big mouth.
<es>

@155
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks, Mizuki."
<es>

@156
<en>I can hear his voice.
<es>

@157
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Your coughing is noisy."
<es>

@158
<en>"I know it."
<es>

@159
<en>Yes. Kazushi is right. Kazushi understands everything. He knows that I can't be honest about my own feelings.
<es>

@160
<en>I hate that fact - and I love that truth.
<es>

@161
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm really gonna go to sleep now."
<es>

@162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry to bother you, Mizuki. Good night."
<es>

@163
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Good night, Kazushi."
<es>

@164
<en>I pull my bedclothes over my head. I now can sleep.
<es>

@166
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, Kazushi."
<es>

@167
<en>There is something I wanted to tell him. Something I have always wanted to tell him. I think I can tell him now.
<es>

@168
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm? What's up?"
<es>

@169
<en>Kazushi sounds a bit sleepy. Are the warm blanket and the cold relief working?
<es>

@170
<en>Please listen to me while you are dozing out.
<es>

@171
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm sorry about the other day."
<es>

@172
<en>I always wanted to say it. I took it out on you and everyone.
<es>

@173
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@174
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry. They will accept your apology."
<es>

@175
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Thank you."
<es>

@176
<en>I will apologize to them, though they may not really accept it.
<es>

@177
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No worries, Mizuki. They will understand it."
<es>

@178
<en>His drowsy voice sounds comfortable to me.
<es>

@179
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Thanks."
<es>

@180
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Go to sleep, Mizuki. I'm sleepy."
<es>

@181
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes. Good night."
<es>

@182
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sleep well and stay healthy, Mizuki. Or you will not get your legs cured."
<es>

@183
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? My legs?"
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I told you. I will get your legs to move."
<es>

@185
<en>He sounds really drowsy now. He must be talking in his sleep. So he is not convincing at all.
<es>

@186
<en>Nonetheless, Mizuki feels at ease.
<es>

@187
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I will wait then."
<es>

@188
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, you wait."
<es>

@189
<en>I now can hear Kazushi's sleep-breath.
<es>

@190
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Good night..."
<es>

@191
<en>Mizuki nods one more time. With Kazushi's sleep-breath as a lullaby, she comfortably falls asleep.
<es>

@199
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wowww!!"
<es>

@200
<en>The flask broke into pieces. We failed again!
<es>

@203
<en>{Pierre}\n"Shit! It didn't work!!"
<es>

@204
<en>We have all tried refinements in many different ways, but kept failing. We knew it was not easy, but we all get frustrated.
<es>

@208
<en>{Haruka}\n"Maybe it's too difficult for us to do it...What do you think, Ms. Ibuki?"
<es>

@213
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, it is difficult - no question about that."
<es>

@214
<en>Ms. Ibuki nods in a serious look.
<es>

@215
<en>{Mei}\n"I heard about Mizuki's legs from Mr.Miya. He said her legs were too damaged to be restored with ordinary medicine."
<es>

@216
<en>Listening to Ms. Ibuki's talk, some girls look away with a pitiful expression. Mr.Miya was able to make her legs look normal with the power of alchemy.
<es>

@217
<en>{Mei}\n"Mr.Miya restored her legs, but on the surface only. He could not bring life into them, so to speak."
<es>

@218
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Life?"
<es>

@219
<en>{Mei}\n"Her legs are artificial, not real. They are already dead."
<es>

@220
<en>I already know that.
<es>

@221
<en>Mizuki's legs are not moving at all and they don't even look like part of her body.
<es>

@222
<en>Her legs surely don't look like they have blood in them.
<es>

@225
<en>{Mei}\n"Curing her legs means we need the skills to recreate or reproduce a life. So I don't think we need a further explanation why it's so difficult."
<es>

@230
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Recreate and reproduce a life..."
<es>

@231
<en>The skills to bring the dead back to life. Yes, it sure does sound very difficult to do.
<es>

@232
<en>So what we are trying to do is an extremely difficult task.
<es>

@237
<en>{Mei}\n"Mr.Miya is even thinking of making artificial legs out of her real legs. You put through a "core"in her both legs and make them work like real legs."
<es>

@239
<en>As a girl, Mizuki should care about how her legs look like. So such a way may be the best way as the last resort.
<es>

@240
<en>But, no matter how difficult it may be, I want to bring life back to her legs.
<es>

@241
<en>So that once again she can swim with the dolphins. I want her to make her dreams come true that she wants to swim in the seas all around the world.
<es>

@242
<en>Is it too difficult to wish for those dreams?
<es>

@246
<en>{Appo-}\n"I don't understand all the theoretical stuff. We just do it, right?"
<es>

@247
<en>Appo's happy-go-lucky personality breaks such a gloomy atmosphere.
<es>

@252
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah. We are not high IQ people. So you'll never know until you try."
<es>

@259
<en>{Daigo}\n"I only got 30 in the T-score."
<es>

@263
<en>{Ran}\n"30? That's pretty low."
<es>

@266
<en>{Appo-}\n"I know how difficult it is. So let us just try first."
<es>

@267
<en>{Daigo}\n"It's like baseball. To hit the ball, first you got to swing the bat."
<es>

@271
<en>{Pierre}\n"If her legs can really move, it doesn't matter whether it's miracle or what..."
<es>

@275
<en>{Ran}\n"Thanks guys for all the optimistic and easy comments."
<es>

@278
<en>{Appo-}\n"You are welcome."
<es>

@282
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"There is no point being pessimistic. It feels good to have the positive attitude."
<es>

@289
<en>{Sakura}\n"And we will be better off that way."
<es>

@291
<en>Everyone gets enthusiasm. Yes, we can make it. We just keep moving.
<es>

@297
<en>{Haruka}\n".................."
<es>

@298
<en>Among them, Haruka seems to be contemplating.
<es>

@299
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka, what is up?"
<es>

@302
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ms. Ibuki, you said we will need the skills to reproduce life, right?"
<es>

@303
<en>Does anything ring the bell? I wonder...
<es>

@308
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes. What is the matter?"
<es>

@309
<en>{Haruka}\n"Is that same skills needed for Homncruz?"
<es>

@310
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Homncruz?"
<es>

@311
<en>What does it mean? That sounds familiar.
<es>

@316
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Homncruz is artificial life. It's a high intelligent organism like a human created by people."
<es>

@321
<en>{Appo-}\n"What the hell is that? Can we really do it?"
<es>

@326
<en>{Mei}\n"I know there are people still studying Homncruz. But I have never heard they ever succeed it."
<es>

@327
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Artificial life..."
<es>

@328
<en>If such a thing is really possible, making her legs move shouldn't be that difficult.
<es>

@334
<en>{Haruka}\n"We used to have a person who studied Homncruz in our school."
<es>

@335
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@336
<en>Her serious, grave voice echoes throughout the room.
<es>

@337
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Someone studied Homncruz in our school?"
<es>

@342
<en>{Mei}\n"I heard of it before. But I was not sure if that was true. So is it for real?"
<es>

@343
<en>Even Ms. Ibuki doesn't' know much. Haruka looks very serious.
<es>

@344
<en>There is no reason for Haruka to lie about it.
<es>

@347
<en>{Haruka}\n"That is before you came to this island, Ms. Ibuki."
<es>

@348
<en>How did Haruka know about this? Did anyone tell her?
<es>

@349
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who knows Homncruz then?"
<es>

@352
<en>{Haruka}\n"My grandma."
<es>

@355
<en>{Mei}\n"The principal..."
<es>

@356
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So if we can get her help, maybe we can..."
<es>

@357
<en>If the principal can help us with our effort, we may be able to cure Mizuki's legs...
<es>

@360
<en>{Haruka}\n"It may not be that easy. There is the principle of equivalency exchanges in the realm of magic. To generate a life, we need something equal to that life."
<es>

@361
<en>To have Mizuki's life back, we got to find something as valuable as those?
<es>

@362
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If you need the legs, take my fuckin' legs! If not, take my life. I want her legs back!"
<es>

@363
<en>I will do anything for her...
<es>

@364
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi, calm down. The principle of equivalency exchanges doesn't require anything exactly same thing. It only claims something as valuable as that."
<es>

@369
<en>{Appo-}\n"Hmm? So? What does it mean?"
<es>

@374
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"It's not like legs for legs, or life for life."
<es>

@378
<en>{Ran}\n"That makes sense. Otherwise, we would need money to get money."
<es>

@379
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see. What do we need then?"
<es>

@380
<en>I will get anything if that can bring Mizuki's legs back.
<es>

@381
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Homncruz, right? So there should be something."
<es>

@386
<en>{Haruka}\n".................."
<es>

@387
<en>Everyone stares at Haruka, waiting for her answer. She is earnestly thinking of something.
<es>

@388
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka, do you remember something? Anything..."
<es>

@391
<en>{Haruka}\n"Grandma has been looking for a stone for a long time. If we get the stone, maybe we can..."
<es>

@392
<en>The stone that the principal has been looking for?
<es>

@393
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A stone...?"
<es>

@394
<en>{Haruka}\n"We have never found that stone. If we have it, we may be able to create some different effects."
<es>

@395
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So if we have that stone..."
<es>

@398
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yes. There might be the possibility..."
<es>

@399
<en>Haruka's story gives me something we all can feel positive about. Maybe, we can get out of this no-win situation.
<es>

@405
<en>{Mei}\n"The question is where we can find the stone."
<es>

@406
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"The principal may know something."
<es>

@410
<en>{Pierre}\n"Why don't we just go ask her then?"
<es>

@411
<en>However, Haruka shakes her head hesitantly.
<es>

@416
<en>{Haruka}\n"Even if she knows it, she would not tell us easily. She has got a big dream and wants to use the stone to make that dream come true."
<es>

@417
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So that stone..."
<es>

@418
<en>{Haruka}\n"Even if we find that, she may not let us use it. But, the stone seems to be the only way we save Mizuki..."
<es>

@419
<en>A grave atmosphere gathers all around. That might be the way to cure Mizuki's legs, but it is not possible.
<es>

@423
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, we had better find that stone before the principal does."
<es>

@428
<en>{Rin}\n"But the principal also needs it too, right?"
<es>

@432
<en>{Sakura}\n"But we can't think of anything else, can we?"
<es>

@437
<en>{Appo-}\n"What are you gonna do, Kazushi? If you want to do it, we will be on your side."
<es>

@442
<en>{Daigo}\n"Yeah."
<es>

@449
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's right. It's up to you, Kazushi."
<es>

@450
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@454
<en>The principal must desperately wants the stone to make her dreams come true.
<es>

@455
<en>Do we have the right to take the stone away from her? But we also need that stone to help Mizuki.
<es>

@456
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will talk to the principal."
<es>

@457
<en>This is my decision.
<es>

@460
<en>{Ran}\n"That's a very important stone for her too, right? Can she really let you use it?"
<es>

@461
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's why we can't just take that away. Mizuki would not be happy even if we did."
<es>

@466
<en>{Rin}\n"I agree. Mizuki would not be happy if she finds out about it."
<es>

@467
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will talk to the principal."
<es>

@472
<en>{Haruka}\n"Okay. I will go with you."
<es>

@473
<en>Haruka looks up at me with determined eyes.
<es>

@474
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks, Haruka."
<es>

@475
<en>Her presence may help me to convince her.
<es>

@480
<en>{Mei}\n"I will go too. Let me also ask her myself."
<es>

@485
<en>{Daigo}\n"Why don't we all go there together then?"
<es>

@490
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah, that's right! A gig group may scare her, you know."
<es>

@494
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Hey, we are not going to scare her or anything. I'm a bit worried, so I will go too."
<es>

@499
<en>{Haruka}\n"Why don't we all go together? The grandma may understand it better if we ask her together."
<es>

@500
<en>Everyone is charged up in trying to help Mizuki and me.
<es>

@501
<en>That is so encouraging and empowering.
<es>

@502
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks, guys."
<es>

@503
<en>Everything is going to be fine, Mizuki. Your friends try to help you. So you will get your legs back.
<es>

@504
<en>I will make it happen.
<es>

@511
<en>{Principal}\n".................."
<es>

@512
<en>There is a heavy atmosphere in her office. I said what I had to say. All now depend on the principal's decision.
<es>

@513
<en>{Principal}\n".................."
<es>

@514
<en>The principal remains silent. She just gives us a penetrating glance.
<es>

@515
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah...Principal..."
<es>

@516
<en>{Principal}\n"Is that all you had to say?"
<es>

@517
<en>She opens her mouth. It doesn't sound very good.
<es>

@518
<en>{Principal}\n"Is it you, Haruka, that told them about it."
<es>

@519
<en>The principal gives Haruka a sharp look.
<es>

@524
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yes. It's because that is all I could remember."
<es>

@525
<en>{Principal}\n"So you want me to give up everything I have earned just because you want your friend's legs cured?"
<es>

@528
<en>The principal gives a hard look and harsh words to Haruka, who looks down and wait for her grandma's next words patiently.
<es>

@529
<en>{Haruka}\n"......Yes."
<es>

@530
<en>She says in a feebly, trembling voice.
<es>

@531
<en>{Principal}\n"What?"
<es>

@534
<en>{Haruka}\n"I said yes."
<es>

@535
<en>Haruka stares at her grandmother.
<es>

@536
<en>{Haruka}\n"You have to let go, grandma. You have done a lot. Please don't blame yourself."
<es>

@537
<en>Haruka tries to speak to the principal in a different tone of voice. There must be something hidden in her words we do not know about.
<es>

@538
<en>Haruka and the principal look at each other. The rest of us feel a sudden change of atmosphere, while looking at them with a strained look.
<es>

@539
<en>{Principal}\n"How dear you, Haruka? I don't want to hear anything. Please leave, everyone."
<es>

@542
<en>Spinning her chair, the principal turns her back on us.
<es>

@543
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait. We really need the power of the stone for Mizuki."
<es>

@546
<en>{Principal}\n"You do?"
<es>

@547
<en>Turning her head toward me, she says in an angry voice.
<es>

@550
<en>{Principal}\n"What is wrong with losing one or two legs? Her life was saved, which she should be grateful for. Don't make a big deal out of this."
<es>

@551
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What did you say?"
<es>

@552
<en>Her comments provoke me to anger. The principal intimidates us so much we are all scared of even looking at her back.
<es>

@557
<en>{Haruka}\n"Grandma, don't say the thing like that and Kazushi, calm down."
<es>

@558
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I understand."
<es>

@559
<en>Yes, I have to calm. I have to control myself.
<es>

@560
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please take back what you just said, principal."
<es>

@563
<en>{Principal}\n"No I won't. Don't bother me with such a trivial matter."
<es>

@564
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@569
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi, no!"
<es>

@573
<en>{Principal}\n"That stone is the source of the power that this island possesses. You must use it for the greater purpose - - not for such a trifling thing."
<es>

@574
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A trifling thing?"
<es>

@575
<en>I am about to blow my top.
<es>

@579
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, wait, Kazushi!"
<es>

@584
<en>The moment Pierre stops me, I jump over the desk for the principle...
<es>

@586
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What that...?"
<es>

@587
<en>I was about to reach my arm over to her, but next moment....she disappeared!
<es>

@590
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wowww!!"
<es>

@591
<en>I smash myself against the wall behind the principal's chair and fall down on the floor.
<es>

@592
<en>Then I look up and find the principal staring down at me.
<es>

@593
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You son of...!!"
<es>

@594
<en>She turns her appearance on and off.
<es>

@595
<en>What the hell is going on? I don't even know where to throw my anger to? Shit, I can't move now...
<es>

@598
<en>{Principal}\n"Get out! All of you!"
<es>

@599
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Damn!"
<es>

@600
<en>I can't move...
<es>

@604
<en>{Daigo}\n"Are you okay?"
<es>

@605
<en>I stand up while Daigo helps me up. My head still spins, while Haruka stands up before me to confront the principal.
<es>

@609
<en>{Haruka}\n"Grandma, can you please think it over?"
<es>

@610
<en>Haruka's sad voice doesn't seem to reach the old lady's heart. The principal looks away from her grandchild.
<es>

@614
<en>{Principal}\n"No more, Haruka, or you, too, will be sorry."
<es>

@618
<en>{Haruka}\n"Okay...I got it."
<es>

@619
<en>Haruka gives up and leaves the principal's room.
<es>

@620
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka..."
<es>

@621
<en>{Haruka}\n"Let's go, Kazushi. She won't listen."
<es>

@625
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Yeah. We will be back."
<es>

@626
<en>The rest of the guys nod in agreement. No other choices, huh...
<es>

@627
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay."
<es>

@629
<en>I leave the principal's room while Daigo and Appo hold me standing.
<es>

@630
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not gonna give up."
<es>

@631
<en>I couldn't leave without saying it.
<es>

@634
<en>{Principal}\n".................."
<es>

@635
<en>The principal stares at me hard and I stare at her back.
<es>

@636
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ever..."
<es>

@637
<en>{Principal}\n"Just leave."
<es>

@641
<en>{Daigo}\n"Let's go."
<es>

@642
<en>I left the room with assistance. I won't give up, no matter what!
<es>

@649
<en>{Pierre}\n"What that hell was that?"
<es>

@654
<en>{Appo-}\n"All of a sudden, she disappeared."
<es>

@658
<en>{Sakura}\n"When Kazushi tried to jump onto her, right? It looks like the principal disappeared in a split second."
<es>

@659
<en>So they also saw the same thing. It's not my illusion.
<es>

@663
<en>{Rin}\n"Is she a ninja?"
<es>

@664
<en>{Sakura}\n"It must be an act of alchemy."
<es>

@669
<en>{Haruka}\n"Don't get overwhelmed by this, everyone. That's only a childish trick."
<es>

@670
<en>Haruka is still upset. It seems she is ready to face off with the principal again.
<es>

@674
<en>{Mei}\n"We are completely being stuck."
<es>

@675
<en>She is right. The only hope we had is now effectively cut off.
<es>

@679
<en>{Appo-}\n"You just back off like that?"
<es>

@680
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course not..."
<es>

@681
<en>I can't give up now. No, I won't give up.
<es>

@686
<en>{Pierre}\n"It seems like the principal won't let you get the stone. What are you gonna do?"
<es>

@687
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@688
<en>The stone is the only possibility I have - - so I can't give up on that. At the same time, I can't give these guys any more trouble.
<es>

@689
<en>I can't get them involved in the flight with the principle.
<es>

@694
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi, let's do it."
<es>

@695
<en>Haruka said it decisively. Her voice surprised me a bit because it didn't sound like her - - quite manly.
<es>

@696
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do what?"
<es>

@697
<en>{Haruka}\n"The power of the stone should be used for Mizuki, not for the grandma. So please don't give up."
<es>

@698
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What about the principal's dream?"
<es>

@699
<en>The principal's is Haruka's grandmother. Her dream is as important as hers?
<es>

@702
<en>{Haruka}\n"Grandma's dream is not something I admire. She has been hanging onto this dream for too many years. She is held captive in that dream."
<es>

@705
<en>{Haruka}\n"Actually, I want to help the grandma out of there. Kazushi, I want you to use the stone for Mizuki."
<es>

@706
<en>Haruka gives me a determined look. I don't know what exactly is going on between her and the principal. But I see her sincerity.
<es>

@707
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay."
<es>

@708
<en>I nod affirmatively.
<es>

@711
<en>{Haruka}\n"Thanks."
<es>

@712
<en>Haruka, then, smiles at me. I believe what she think is right.
<es>

@713
<en>This is for Mizuki, and maybe the principal as well. I'm determined to use the stone for Mizuki.
<es>

@717
<en>{Ran}\n"What are you going to do? You don't even know where the stone is, do you?"
<es>

@722
<en>{Daigo}\n"The principal is also looking for it, right? It may be hard to get ahead."
<es>

@726
<en>{Rin}\n"She is ninja too."
<es>

@730
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Any clues for its whereabouts?"
<es>

@734
<en>{Haruka}\n"No idea. The grandma has been looking for it all over."
<es>

@735
<en>{Haruka}\n"But the stone was first found out inside the school basement. It is a cave in there now."
<es>

@736
<en>{Haruka}\n"There is the laboratory building standing right above the cave. Maybe, we should check that lab building out first."
<es>

@737
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Or maybe we should instead..."
<es>

@740
<en>I get everyone's eyes on me. We can't think in a complicated way...so...
<es>

@741
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...hijack the whole building."
<es>

@747
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki!"
<es>

@748
<en>Up in bed, Mizuki was looking outside the window and she looks back at me.
<es>

@751
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh...Hey..."
<es>

@752
<en>Mizuki looks confused a bit.
<es>

@753
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that's right."
<es>

@754
<en>It's been a while since I last came to see her in her room. Besides, we have not really made it up yet.
<es>

@755
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh...I..."
<es>

@756
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Never mind...We will talk later. We need to get going now."
<es>

@757
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Going where?"
<es>

@758
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The crutches...no. The wheelchair...no. Too troublesome. Get on my back."
<es>

@759
<en>I get down and show my back to Mizuki.
<es>

@760
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Where are we going? I can't move my legs, and I am only wearing pajamas now..."
<es>

@761
<en>Mizuki hesitates.
<es>

@762
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, come on! Let me kidnap you, then."
<es>

@764
<en>I put her bedclothes over Mizuki's head.
<es>

@768
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, wait...ugh....!?"
<es>

@774
<en>{Principal}\n"What? The lab building is being hijacked?"
<es>

@779
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Yes. That's what they are saying."
<es>

@780
<en>{Principal}\n"Who are they?"

<es>

@786

<es>

@793
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What that hell are you thinking?!"
<es>

@794
<en>Mizuki is pretty upset because she was carried over being wrapped up in the bedclothes.
<es>

@795
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry, but because you were grumbling..."
<es>

@796
<en>I calm her down and have her seated.
<es>

@797
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You wouldn't be so rough with me if you are truly in love with me. Do you really love me?!"
<es>

@798
<en>She gets sulky, while others giggle at us.
<es>

@801
<en>{Ran}\n"There you guys go again -- lover's quarrel."
<es>

@806
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"That's okay."
<es>

@810
<en>{Haruka}\n"Mizuki and Kazushi, you guys really love each other, huh?"
<es>

@814
<en>{Sakura}\n"Don't we look like clowns for them? You know what? How about just going with the idea that Kazushi gives up his own legs to replace Mizuki's?"
<es>

@819
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@820
<en>Now Mizuki realizes everyone is around, she feels flushed. She should have been more watchful in the first place.
<es>

@823
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, guys..."
<es>

@824
<en>Mizuki speaks slowly and timidly.
<es>

@825
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm very sorry for what I said...the other day..."
<es>

@826
<en>Mizuki lowers her head. But they all look vacant.
<es>

@831
<en>{Haruka}\n"What are you sorry for?"
<es>

@832
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh...I'm sorry for what I said when you guys came to see me in the clinic, you know?"
<es>

@836
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, yeah. You were yelling out something. Now I remember. Here is the deal. We will forgive you with 500 yen."

<es>

@842
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Me?"

@845

@846
<en>{Kazushi}\n"O-Okay..."
<es>

@847
<en>They took my 500 yen...Why me?
<es>

@850
<en>{Ran}\n"Thank youWe now put it all behind."
<es>

@855
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Knock it off, Ran. We were not angry at all, Mizuki."
<es>

@858
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Not angry? But I said pretty nasty things to you guys..."
<es>

@865
<en>{Haruka}\n"We didn't mind those...You are going through tough times yourself, Mizuki."
<es>

@866

<es>

@869
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Fix my legs?"
<es>

@870
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's right. You will be able to walk and swim again."
<es>

@871
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Swim again?"
<es>

@875
<en>{Appo-}\n"With the help of alchemy."
<es>

@878
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No... you guys can't do that. Even Mr.Miya, an expert on alchemy, couldn't cure my legs."
<es>

@881
<en>Mizuki sounds a bit depressed. She must have remembered when she first heard about her legs.
<es>

@882
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I really appreciate Mr.Miya's help because he restored my legs this beautifully after they were completely smashed."
<es>

@883
<en>But to me, her legs are nothing but fake, though they do look beautiful with no scares or anything on them.

<es>

@885

@924
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, I...I am neither a good cook nor of much help."
<es>

@925
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Thank you, Ran. I am so grateful, everyone."

<en>Mizuki presses her face against my shoulder.
<es>

@931
<en>She wanted to hide her cry.
<es>

@932
<en>Everyone gives her a warm smile.
<es>

@933
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't cry. They are watching."
<es>

@934
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm not."
<es>

@935
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay, Ran. Since you said you are not of any help, I will give you an assignment. You make Mizuki laugh with 10 jokes everyday."
<es>

@938
<en>{Ran}\n"What kind of assignment is that? Don't you feel shamed of treating your ex-girlfriend?"
<es>

@941
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Ex-girlfriend?"
<es>

@942
<en>Mizuki becomes flushed - not with embarrassment, but anger.
<es>

@943
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What are you talking about? You have never been my girlfriend!"
<es>

@946
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, that's right. We may as well keep our secret, right?"
<es>

@947
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There is no secret!"
<es>

@950
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't mind if that is the past...But tell me the truth about everything, okay?"
<es>

@951
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There is nothing to tell you!"
<es>

@954
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Did you do something you can't tell me about?!"
<es>

@956
<en>What a turn of events! Mizuki erupts!
<es>

@957
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Is that something you did to me? Or something you have done yet?"
<es>

@960
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"What exactly did you two do and not do? I'm very interested."
<es>

@965
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, guys! Focus! Don't you forget we are barricading ourselves in this room?"
<es>

@968
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Barricading? We are?"
<es>

@969
<en>Mizuki stopped hitting me and she throws a blank look.
<es>

@970
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. You didn't notice?"
<es>

@974
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"You are now being surrounded!! So put your hands up and come out!"
<es>

@977

<es>

@980

<es>

@981
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? Now you know it."
<es>

@982
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What is this?"
<es>

@983
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe I should have told you before kidnapping."
<es>

@989
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"You are now being surrounded!!...Oh, come on! Don't let me say anything stupid any more! Just come out, and we won't put you in jail!"
<es>

@994
<en>{Principal}\n"How is it going?"
<es>

@997
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"No, they don't come out. I guess they are serious."
<es>

@998
<en>{Principal}\n"They don't know how important that facility is in our school."
<es>

@999
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Yes, but they are just kids..."
<es>

@1000
<en>{Principal}\n"I don't need your help. I am going inside now and get them out of there."
<es>

@1002
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Getting them out? Wait, the principal!"
<es>

@1008
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, the principal is coming!"
<es>

@1009

<es>

@1010
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is she coming alone?"
<es>

@1011
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah. She is coming in from the main entrance."
<es>

@1012
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The main entrance? Isn't that locked?"
<es>

@1013
<en>{Pierre}\n"Uh! She got the keys!!"
<es>

@1014
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The duplicates!"

@1017
<en>{Pierre}\n"What are we gonna do now?"
<es>

@1018
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1019
<en>We see someone standing in her way.
<es>

@1020
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume!"
<es>

@1026
<en>{Principal}\n"Get out of my way."
<es>

@1027
<en>{Natsume}\n"No. I won't let you through from here."
<es>

@1028
<en>{Principal}\n"It's not like you, Natsume. Why are you doing this?"
<es>

@1029
<en>{Natsume}\n"Kazushi is looking for something. No one comes in until he finds it."
