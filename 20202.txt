@9
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wow, the sun's so bright!"
<es>

@10
<en>The ocean sparkled in the morning sunlight, which was too bright for my eyes after staying up all night.
<es>

@11
<en>Mizuki's riotous party lasted until it was nearly dawn, so we decided to stay up and come watch the sunrise together.
<es>

@12
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We didn't get to sleep at all, huh?"
<es>

@15
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Everyone else fell asleep, though."
<es>

@16
<en>All our friends passed out in the cafeteria. Mizuki and I were the only ones that stayed awake through the end, so we decided to go outside and take a walk.
<es>

@19
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Thank you, Kazushi. I really had a good time."
<es>

@20
<en>I felt a little shy hearing Mizuki thank me so honestly for once. Did she do that just because she's a year older now?\nThe sun seems kind of brighter than normal today...
<es>

@23
<en>{Mizuki}\n"This is the first time I've ever had a birthday party like that thrown for me."
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? Well, I guess people do stop having them less as they get older. But you had plenty as a kid, right?"
<es>

@25
<en>{Mizuki}\n"In my case, it was always on a bad day. I mean, August 1st is in the middle of summer break, right?"
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh...you're right."
<es>

@27
<en>It reminded me that summer vacation was still going on. I almost forgot about it because we were all together just like usual.
<es>

@28
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I know how Kudou-kun felt when he said he'd never had his own birthday party before. During summer break, no one except your family's around to celebrate your birthday."
<es>

@29
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There's no school, and everyone likes to go on family trips too."
<es>

@30
<en>When I was a kid, I was never home during the summer.
<es>

@31
<en>I would always do all kinds of activities like going off to summer camps, visiting my grandparents, taking family holidays...
<es>

@32
<en>I'd spend almost the entire summer playing my head off.
<es>

@35
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's why I never got to have a party with my friends. But last night was a lot of fun."
<es>

@36
<en>Mizuki gave me a humble, yet beaming smile. Up to the crack of dawn, she was romping around with everyone else at the party.
<es>

@37
<en>I wish I could have had more time to prepare a bigger party for her.
<es>

@38
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We'll have to throw an even bigger party for you next year."
<es>

@39
<en>Next year will be my comeback performance. I'll surprise her even more than this year.
<es>

@42
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Are we doing it again next year?"
<es>

@43
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course. Next year, and the year after that...as you get older."
<es>

@46
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Year after next? You know, we'll be graduating by then."
<es>

@47
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that's right."
<es>

@48
<en>I never thought of graduation. Gee, I won't be here in two years?
<es>

@49
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Graduation, huh?"
<es>

@50
<en>It's funny. I just came to this island a month ago, but I can already feel how much I'm going to miss it.
<es>

@53
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm? What's wrong with you, reminiscing at dawn?"
<es>

@54
<en>Mizuki peered into my eyes as I contemplated it. Then I noticed her gaze, and we twitched as our eyes met.
<es>

@57
<en>{Mizuki}\n"S-sorry."
<es>

@59
<en>Flushing slightly, she turned her head away.
<es>

@62
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahaha, this is strange."
<es>

@64
<en>She ran off towards the water while scratching her head in embarrassment.
<es>

@65
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, where are you going?"
<es>

@66
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No! Don't come here!!"
<es>

@67
<en>Her panicked voice. What's she doing?
<es>

@69
<en>*SPLASH*
<es>

@71
<en>I heard a splash from the ocean echoing against the rocks. It must be Mizuki jumping in.
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Mizuki. Are you okay? You didn't get any sleep, you know?"
<es>

@73
<en>Mizuki came straight here with me after drinking and making merry at the party all night. This could be too dangerous, even for her.
<es>

@74
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Mmmmmm! It feels so good!"
<es>

@75
<en>Despite my concerns, Mizuki was swimming around pleasantly.
<es>

@76
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you okay?"
<es>

@77
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm more than okay! Who do you think I am?"
<es>

@78
<en>Well, I was worried for nothing then.
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are pretty tough, huh?"
<es>

@80
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, I kind of am, but so are you, Kazushi."
<es>

@81
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's right. I'm much tougher than you are."
<es>

@82
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, you said it. Then let's race! One lap around the island!"
<es>

@83
<en>Mizuki began to swim with great vigor.
<es>

@84
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, I didn't say I would."
<es>

@85
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I win by default then!"
<es>

@87
<en>Damn...
<es>

@88
<en>I hate to lose, but I know I'm not gonna win - I'm still not at swimming.
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Besides, aren't you still drunk? It's not safe to swim under the influence, especially with your clothes still on..."
<es>

@90
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@91
<en>Then, something dotting the rocky path caught my eye. They looked like clothes.
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, these are your clothes!"
<es>

@93
<en>I picked them up and recognized them as hers. I guess she took all her clothes off before getting in the water.
<es>

@94
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hehe. I made sure to strip off my clothes!"
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"When did you..."
<es>

@96
<en>That means she's naked under the water... Ggh, just imagining that was seductive to my mind and body, already excited by the all-night party.
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. No. No..."
<es>

@98
<en>Just thinking about it was nearly making me hard so I tried to distract myself by folding her clothes.
<es>

@99
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@100
<en>If she stripped down to swim, that means she stripped off her underwear too. I could see her panties mixed in with the rest of her clothes.
<es>

@101
<en>{Kazushi}\n"........."
<es>

@102
<en>I picked them up. They were still warm.
<es>

@103
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So warm..."
<es>

@104
<en>I stretched them out. Why does doing something perverted like this always get me so damn turned on?
<es>

@105
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wooooooo!!"
<es>

@106
<en>Since we pulled an all-nighter, she must have been wearing these all day yesterday.
<es>

@107
<en>I saw some stains in the center, indicating that it was true...
<es>

@108
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Gyaaaaaaah!! H-hey! What the hell are you spreading and looking at, you idiot?!!"
<es>

@109
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, shit..."
<es>

@110
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You pervert! Lunatic!"
<es>

@111
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!?"
<es>

@112
<en>OK, if you're going to play it that way, I'll do exactly what a pervert does.
<es>

@113
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see. Then this is Mizuki's..... Ooooh, I think I see a little hair in here..."
<es>

@114
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Why youuuuuuuu!!!"
<es>

@117
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@118
<en>I think this is what they called deja vu. The sight was rather nostalgic.
<es>

@122
<en>{Mizuki}\n"KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"
<es>

@126
<en>But it wasn't nostalgic for Mizuki. She hid in the rock's shadows.
<es>

@127
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ooh... He saw me again..."
<es>

@128
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm impressed - you look so different from yesterday. Your body's finally another year older, and it looks more mature too."
<es>

@129
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Nothing's going to change in just a day! Ohhh, why does Kazushi keep seeing me when I'm naked? It really bugs me."
<es>

@130
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All I can say is sorry."
<es>

@131
<en>I don't do it on purpose, so it's not really my fault, and Mizuki knows it too.
<es>

@132
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can only say that we were burn under such stars. Surely, it's destiny."
<es>

@133
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't want that destiny!"
<es>

@134
<en>Mizuki screamed out to the blue morning sky. But for some reason, she looked happy doing it.
<es>

@135
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does it really bother you?"
<es>

@136
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Of course it does! How could I... let such places be seen. I'm sure... no one will want to take me as a bride now."
<es>

@137
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then... what if I said I would?"
<es>

@138
<en>I surprised myself at how easily I said that.
<es>

@143
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What?"
<es>

@144
<en>Mizuki looks vacant and flushed.
<es>

@145
<en>{Mizuki}\n"K-Kazushi, look, do you really know what you are saying?"
<es>

@146
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Y-yeah! I said I'll take you in."
<es>

@147
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Take me in... I'm not a dog or a cat. What do you plan on doing if you take me?"
<es>

@148
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well... I'd make you happy."
<es>

@149
<en>{Mizuki}\n"........."
<es>

@151
<en>For a moment, we heard nothing but the waves lapping up against the shore.\nNo... I can hear someone's heart beating.\nWait, it's mine.
<es>

@153
<en>{Mizuki}\n"A-aren't you embarrassed, s-saying something like that?"
<es>

@154
<en>{Kazushi}\n"V-very much so."
<es>

@155
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Right? I'd be too..."
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But I mean it."
<es>

@157
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? You mean it?"
<es>

@158
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I mean it."
<es>

@159
<en>{Mizuki}\n"........."
<es>

@160
<en>Mizuki remained silent. We could hear the waves.
<es>

@161
<en>I finally said something decisive. But now that I have, there's no turning back.
<es>

@162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Mizuki..."
<es>

@163
<en>{Mizuki}\n"W-what is it?"
<es>

@164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm, would you g-go out with me?"
<es>

@165
<en>Damn! I said it! My heart nearly exploded.
<es>

@166
<en>{Mizuki}\n"........."
<es>

@167
<en>Mizuki kept quiet and turns around.
<es>

@168
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Weren't we already going out?"
<es>

@169
<en>She whispered that to me as she faced away. Does that mean yes?
<es>

@170
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah. Right, we are already..."
<es>

@171
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, that's right."
<es>

@172
<en>Mizuki sounded very calm while keeping her back to me, standing shoulder deep in the water.
<es>

@173
<en>Her back was turned, yet I knew all of her focus was on me.
<es>

@174
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I come over there?"
<es>

@175
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? Wh-why?"
<es>

@176
<en>She sounded a bit confused, but she already knew what I was going to ask, and...
<es>

@177
<en>She was probably certain about what I wanted. For someone not good with dirty jokes, she's awfully sharp.
<es>

@178
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't want me to?"
<es>

@179
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's okay."
<es>

@180
<en>She gave me the green light.
<es>

@181
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm coming over, then."
<es>

@182
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes..."
<es>

@184
<en>I walked over to the rocky stretch where Mizuki was.
<es>

@185
<en>{Mizuki}\n"........."
<es>

@186
<en>I could see Mizuki's back. I could reach out and touch her from here. She still wasn't moving.
<es>

@187
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki, are you... sure about this?"
<es>

@188
<en>She knows what I mean. Her shoulders trembled slightly as proof.
<es>

@189
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Are you sure you're alright with me?"
<es>

@190
<en>What a silly question.
<es>

@191
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I want you, Mizuki."
<es>

@192
<en>{Mizuki}\n"......what an oddball."
<es>
