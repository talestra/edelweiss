<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wow, the sun is so bright!"
<es>

@10
<en>The sea made a sparkling effect in the morning sunlight. The morning sun is pretty dazzling for my eyes, especially after I stayed up all night.
<es>

@11
<en>Mizuki and I come out to the beach after we had her riotous birthday party until dawn this morning.
<es>

@12
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We didn't get to sleep at all, huh?"
<es>

@15
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Everyone else fell asleep."
<es>

@16
<en>All other friends are asleep in the cafeteria. Mizuki and I are the only that survived to the end. So we decided to go outside and walk.
<es>

@19
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Thank you, Kazushi. I truly appreciate what you did for me last night. I really had a good time."
<es>

@20
<en>Mizuki thanks me quite politely, which makes me feel a bit odd. Is it because she's a year older now? Gee, the sunlight is really bright this morning.
<es>

@23
<en>{Mizuki}\n"This is the first time I've ever had a birthday party for myself."
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? But you know what? You are not going to have parties as we grow older. People do such a thing only when they are kids."
<es>

@25
<en>{Mizuki}\n"My birth date is not so kids friendly. It is in the middle of summer break."
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see."
<es>

@27
<en>That reminds me that we are still in the summer vacations. I almost forgot it because everything seems to be the same as usual.
<es>

@29
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I know what Daigo feels about when he said he'd never had a birthday party for himself. I have the exactly same situation. During the summer break, no one except your family is available to celebrate your birthday."
<es>

@31
<en>{Kazushi}\n"School is in recess, and others are out of town."
<es>

@32
<en>When I was a kid, I was never home during the summer.
<es>

@33
<en>I would always do all kinds of activities like going on to the summer camps, seeing my grandparents, going on a trip with family...
<es>

@34
<en>I would spend almost whole summer playing my head off.
<es>

@37
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's why I never had a party with my friends. But last night was a lot of fun."
<es>

@38
<en>Mizuki gives me a humble, yet beaming smile. Up to this morning, she has been romping around with them at the party.
<es>

@39
<en>I wish I could have had more time to prepare a bigger party for her.
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We are going to have an even bigger party for you next year."
<es>

@41
<en>I will do better next year, and a lot more surprises for Mizuki.
<es>

@44
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Do we do it again next year?"
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course. Next year, and year after that...as you get older."
<es>

@48
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Year after next year? We will be graduating by then."
<es>

@49
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that's right."
<es>

@50
<en>I never thought of graduation. Gee, I won't be here in two years?
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Graduation, huh?"
<es>

@52
<en>It's funny. I just came to this island a month ago. But I already miss this place.
<es>

@55
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm? What's up?"
<es>

@56
<en>Mizuki looks straight into my eyes, while I am contemplating. In a flash, we got locked in each other's gaze, which gave me a start.
<es>

@59
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So-Sorry."
<es>

@61
<en>Flushing slightly, she turns her head away.
<es>

@64
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ha Ha...What is going on in my head?"
<es>

@66
<en>While scratching her head in embarrassment, she runs off to the water.
<es>

@67
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, where are you going?"
<es>

@68
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No! Don't come here!!"
<es>

@69
<en>Her panicky voice. What is she doing?
<es>

@71
<en>Splash!!
<es>

@73
<en>I hear the splash in the sea from the lee of a rock. It must be Mizuki jumping in.
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Mizuki. Are you okay? You didn't get any sleep, you know?"
<es>

@75
<en>Mizuki comes straight here with me after all the drinking and making merry at the party. It could be too dangerous even for her.
<es>

@76
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It feels so good!"
<es>

@77
<en>Despite my concern, Mizuki swims around comfortably.
<es>

@78
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you okay?"
<es>

@79
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm more than okay! Who do you think I am?"
<es>

@80
<en>Well, I worry for nothing then.
<es>

@81
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are pretty tough, huh?"
<es>

@82
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So are you, Kazushi."
<es>

@83
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no. I am tougher than you are."
<es>

@84
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, you want to prove it? Let's race. Swim all around the island."
<es>

@85
<en>Mizuki begins to swim with great vigor.
<es>

@86
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, I didn't say I will."
<es>

@87
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I won by default then!"
<es>

@89
<en>Damn...
<es>

@90
<en>I hate to lose, but I know I'm not gonna win - not at swimming.
<es>

@91
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are still drunk. It's not safe to swim while drunk, with your clothes on too..."
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@93
<en>Then, something on the rocky path catches my eyes. They look like...
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Clothes...Mizuki's clothes!"
<es>

@95
<en>I pick them up and recognize them as hers. I guess she took all the clothes off before jumping into the sea.
<es>

@96
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Heh Heh. I am not wearing my clothes!"
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A fast move."
<es>

@98
<en>This means she is naked under water... This is a perfect situation for erotic imaginations.
<es>

@99
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. No. No..."
<es>

@100
<en>Imaginations get my cock hard. I have to distract my mind...
<es>

@101
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@102
<en>Being completely naked means she took all her clothes including her underwear, and I see her panties.
<es>

@103
<en>{Kazushi}\n"... ... ..."
<es>

@104
<en>I touch them.
<es>

@105
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They are still warm..."
<es>

@106
<en>I stretch them out. This kind of kinky thing gets me fuckin' excited.
<es>

@107
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wooooooo!!"
<es>

@108
<en>She must have been wearing these all day today.
<es>

@109
<en>I see some stains at the center.
<es>

@110
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Nooooooooooo!! Hey, what the hell are you looking at?!"
<es>

@111
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shit!"
<es>

@112
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You, pervert!!"
<es>

@113
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!?"
<es>

@114
<en>Okay, if you call me a pervert, I will do what pervert does.
<es>

@115
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see. This is Mizuki's...Hmm..I find a little hair in here..."
<es>

@116
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, you...piece of...!!"
<es>

@119
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@120
<en>I have a feeling of dejya vu as I look at the panties. Something nostalgic...
<es>

@124
<en>{Mizuki}\n"She screams loud."
<es>

@128
<en>Mizuki rushes to hide in rock shadow.
<es>

@129
<en>{Mizuki}\n"God...he is still looking."
<es>

@130
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Since you became a year older, your body seems to maturer more."
<es>

@131
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Nothing is gonna change in one day! How come I always get watched by Kazushi? Why? I don't understand!"
<es>

@132
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am sorry. But it always happens that day."
<es>

@133
<en>I don't do it purposely,so it's not really my fault and Mizuki knows it, too.
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe, this is your destiny."
<es>

@135
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Nooooo! This is not my destiny!"
<es>

@136
<en>Mizuki screams out to the blue morning sky. But somewhat, she looks happy doing that.
<es>

@137
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you not enjoying this?"
<es>

@138
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Of course, not! Look, I'm still a girl...and you have already seen a lot of my...Oh, no one wants to marry me..."
<es>

@139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If so, I will marry you."
<es>

@140
<en>I said that...so bluntly.
<es>

@145
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What?"
<es>

@146
<en>Mizuki looks vacant and flushed.
<es>

@147
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, do you really know what you are saying?"
<es>

@148
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah! I said I will marry you."
<es>

@149
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Don't you even know what marriage means?"
<es>

@150
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah! Making you happy, right?"
<es>

@151
<en>{Mizuki}\n"... ... ..."
<es>

@152
<en>In a moment, we hear nothing but the lapping of waves. No, I can hear someone's heart beating. Wait, it's mine.
<es>

@153
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Are you not embarrassed saying a thing like that?"
<es>

@154
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. Very much so."
<es>

@155
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't blame you."
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But I mean it."
<es>

@157
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? You mean it?"
<es>

@158
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I mean it."
<es>

@159
<en>{Mizuki}\n"... ... ..."
<es>

@160
<en>Mizuki remains silent. We can hear the lapping of waves.
<es>

@161
<en>I finally said it. No turning back.
<es>

@162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki..."
<es>

@163
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I be your boyfriend?"
<es>

@165
<en>Damn! I said it! My heart nearly explodes.
<es>

@166
<en>{Mizuki}\n"... ... ..."
<es>

@167
<en>Mizuki keeps quiet and turns around.
<es>

@168
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Aren't you already my boyfriend?"
<es>

@169
<en>Showing her back, she whispers to him. Does that mean yes?
<es>

@170
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah. Right. I am already your boyfriend..."
<es>

@171
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's right."
<es>

@172
<en>Mizuki sounds very calm now, while showing her back in the water.
<es>

@173
<en>Yet, she is watching me from her back. I know it.
<es>

@174
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I go there?"
<es>

@175
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Why?"
<es>

@176
<en>She sounds a bit confused, but she already knew what I would ask, and...
<es>

@177
<en>What I want -- maybe. Mizuki is sharp in guessing things, although she is not good at sex talks.
<es>

@178
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't want me to come?"
<es>

@179
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's okay."
<es>

@180
<en>She gives me the green light.
<es>

@181
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm coming then."
<es>

@182
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes..."
<es>

@184
<en>I walk over to the rocky stretch where Mizuki is.
<es>

@185
<en>{Mizuki}\n"... ... ..."
<es>

@186
<en>I see Mizuki's back. She remains still.
<es>

@187
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki, are you sure about this?"
<es>

@188
<en>She knows what I mean. Her shoulders tremble slightly.
<es>

@189
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Are you sure about this too?"
<es>

@190
<en>The wrong question.
<es>

@191
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I love you, Mizuki."
<es>

@192
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I love you too, Kazushi"
<es>
