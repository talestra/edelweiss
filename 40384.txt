<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm..."
<es>

@8
<en>I woke up to the chirping of the birds.
<es>

@9
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's morning?"
<es>

@10
<en>I was waking up easier than usual. I thought I was dreaming about something good, something I don't want to wake up from.
<es>

@11
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What was it?"
<es>

@12
<en>I shouldn't have said that out loud. The sleepiness was chased away, and I woke up for real.
<es>

@13
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh well. I should get out of bed anyways."
<es>

@14
<en>I woke myself up, taking the blanket off.
<es>

@16
<en>{Natsume}\n"Zzz."
<es>

@17
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......"
<es>

@18
<en>Natsume-chan was sleeping like a cat beside me. And she was naked.
<es>

@19
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@20
<en>I felt the blood draining from me. I looked around the room and confirmed it wasn't mine.
<es>

@21
<en>And I remembered what happened last night.
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I fell asleep right after that..."
<es>

@23
<en>I guess I went to sleep right after I had my first sex with Natsume-chan. I couldn't remember what happened at the end.
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I hope this isn't another dream."
<es>

@25
<en>This isn't something that happened in that dream world again, is it? I checked out Johnny Kazushi. He was well today, as usual.
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not sure."
<es>

@27
<en>It didn't seem any different than yesterday. It looked a little red, but maybe I rubbed it too hard in my sleep or something.
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I did do her, right?"
<es>

@31
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hmm? Do what?"
<es>

@32
<en>Natsume-chan opened her eyes, talking in a sleepy voice.
<es>

@33
<en>{Natsume}\n"What? Haruma? You're naked."
<es>

@34
<en>And that was her big reaction as she rubbed her eyes.
<es>

@37
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh yeah. Last night..."
<es>

@38
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did we actually do it last night?"
<es>

@39
<en>It felt so wrong, saying it out loud. I sounded like some half-ass adult who got drunk, did a girl, and didn't remember a thing.
<es>

@40
<en>{Natsume}\n"Don't tell me you don't remember?"
<es>

@41
<en>Natsume-chan gave me a frightful look, thinking the same thing.
<es>

@42
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No! I do remember, but I can't think of what happened at the end. And I don't remember why I'm sleeping here."
<es>

@45
<en>{Natsume}\n"It was really good at the end, and we went to sleep like that. I think."
<es>

@46
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, it was that good?"
<es>

@47
<en>That might've been a bit mean to actually say. Natsume-chan's face blushed, and she turned away from me.
<es>

@50
<en>{Natsume}\n"Anyway, we did do it, Haruma. Look at this!"
<es>

@51
<en>She pointed at the sheet. There was a red spot of blood staining the white sheets from when I broke her hymen.
<es>

@52
<en>{Natsume}\n"So? Give up?"
<es>

@53
<en>She waved the stain in front of me like I was the samurai in some drama.
<es>

@54
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, there's nothing to give up about. I was just worried if it was a dream or something, because it made me so happy."
<es>

@57
<en>{Natsume}\n"A-are you that happy?"
<es>

@58
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, of course. I was able to be with you like this, Natsume-chan."
<es>

@59
<en>We were now close enough to wake up naked in the same bed. It was just like a dream. I was finally in a situation like this.
<es>

@60
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@61
<en>She hid her tits as she noticed I was looking at her. I just remembered that she was embarrassed to show her breasts.
<es>

@64
<en>{Natsume}\n"I-I need to change. Look away."
<es>

@65
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Why? What's there to be embarrassed about after all that?"
<es>

@67
<en>*FWUMP*
<es>

@68
<en>She threw a pillow at me.
<es>

@69
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shut up! Just turn around!"
<es>

@70
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fine..."
<es>

@72
<en>We'd already shown each other our most embarrassing parts. I didn't understand why she'd care about that now, or anything, really, about women.
<es>

@73
<en>But Natsume-chan and I finally did it. I've never felt so happy I was scared before, but that's just how I feel now.
<es>

@74
<en>I hoped with all my heart that nothing bad would ever happen to us anymore.
<es>
