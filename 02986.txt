@164
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's not true!\nI wasn't in completely!"

@170
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's not true either!\nMy tip was in! So, I'm not a virgin!"
<es>

@171
<en>{Appo-}\n"Which one are you?"
<es>

@176
<en>He went into prostitute house to get rid of his virginity one day.
<es>

@177
<en>He was cheated by a barker to have an old prostitute as his first partner in bed.
<es>

@178
<en>From the moment he found out his partner is not a young college girl,\nhis memory shut down intermittently.
<es>

@179
<en>If that counts, technically, he's not a virgin anymore.
<es>

@180
<en>But again, his first partner was a prostitute who is old enough to be his mom.
<es>

@181
<en>If that doesn't count, he is still a virgin.
<es>

@182
<en>He doesn't wanna be called a virgin, yet,\nhe doesn't wanna admit that was his first time.\nWe call this Pierre's paradox.
<es>

@188
<en>{Appo-}\n"Who cares!\nLet's just say that you're not a virgin."
<es>

@189
<en>{Pierre}\n"I'm serious!\nGive me a better idea!"
<es>

@192
<en>{Daigo}\n"It's not our problem."

@193
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's your own fault for getting fooled by the barker."
<es>

@196
<en>{Pierre}\n"I just wanted to get rid of it!!"
<es>

@197
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I say you just have to reset and have it all again."
<es>

@200
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi's right. Forget your past."
<es>

@205
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's a good idea.\nI can reset and start all over again, right?"
<es>

@206
<en>{Appo-}\n"I hope it's as easy as it sounds."
<es>

@207
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Just try it again!\nYou can reborn!"
<es>

@210
<en>{Pierre}\n"I'll do it!!\nI will totally be new Pierre!"
<es>

<es>

@228
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's your opinion."
<es>

<es>

@233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, you just gonna have to keep trying."
<es>

<es>

@296
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"How can I be a help for Pierre in such matter?"
<es>

@297
<en>Maybe it wasn't a good idea to talk to Mr.Yagami.
<es>

@298
<en>{Kazushi}\n"He's your student!\nCan you somehow help him?!"
<es>

@301
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"I don't teach kids how to hit on girls.\nAnd Kazushi, since when you start talking to me?"
