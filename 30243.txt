<en>One day we went to the cafeteria and there was a big commotion.
<es>

@10
<en>{Haruka}\n"Wow! Amazing! Kazuko and Appo-kun did this together!?"
<es>

@15
<en>{Fuusen}\n"It's not a big deal."
<es>

@20
<en>{Appo}\n"It's like the fruit of our love for each other."
<es>

@21
<en>Everyone was surrounding Appo and Fuusen.
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's going on?"
<es>

@23
<en>I asked Pierre.
<es>

@28
<en>{Pierre}\n"Appo and Fuusen made silver together in a joint alchemy experiment."
<es>

@29
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Silver? You mean that silver?"
<es>

@34
<en>{Rin}\n"The silver in gold, silver, and pearls, right?"
<es>

@38
<en>{Sakura}\n"Rin, that example's for..."
<es>

@42
<en>{Fuusen}\n"We weren't able to make gold, but I think we did quite a good job."
<es>

@45
<en>Fuusen answered humbly with a beam of satisfaction. Well, they certainly deserved our praise.
<es>

@48
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You did a great job, Appo."
<es>

@49
<en>{Appo}\n"I'm just happy to be done with my summer homework."
<es>

@54
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh yeah, we had homework from Mei-chan! I haven't even thought of anything yet."
<es>

@58
<en>{Daigo}\n"You may have a real talent for this, Appo."
<es>

@59
<en>{Appo}\n"Yeah, maybe. I always believed that I was born with some kind of gift."
<es>

@60
<en>Appo kept on talking with pride. Well, he did deserve the praise for making silver - it was an unprecedented success.
<es>

@64
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hey, hey, how did you do it? What was your trick?"
<es>

@68
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Well... In fact..."
<es>

@69
<en>The girls were talking quietly, but Fuusen's voice was loud enough for all of us to hear.
<es>

@70
<en>{Fuusen}\n"We were having sex while doing the experiment, and Ah-chan's semen accidentally got shot in..."
<es>

@71
<en>What a shocking confession!
<es>

@75
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What?! Be gone!!"
<es>

@80
<en>Suddenly, all the girls jumped over two meters away in surprise from Fuusen.
<es>

@86
<en>{Rin}\n"S-se...what?"
<es>

@91
<en>{Ran}\n"What? What do you mean?"
<es>

@92
<en>Ran was totally getting into this. Get a precious metal involved in the subject and she was hooked.
<es>

@96
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You need to have the right materials and compatibility with the alchemist, right? Maybe it just means Ah-chan's seed has perfect chemistry with me."
<es>

@100
<en>{Haruka}\n"That makes sense. I wish I had a boyfriend."
<es>

@104
<en>{Ran}\n"The chemistry..."
<es>

@108
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Why don't you try, Ran? Even though you haven't succeeded once before, it might go well for you?"
<es>

@111
<en>{Ran}\n"You think so?"
<es>

@114
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You've got to have the right chemistry, you know? I don't think anyone can beat us there, though."
<es>

@117
<en>{Ran}\n"Grr..."
<es>

@118
<en>Huh? Ran seems upset...
<es>

@119
<en>{Ran}\n"Yeah, no one can beat you two."
<es>

@120
<en>But her face lightened up a bit with an evil smile.\nShe's really upset, isn't she?
<es>

@127
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm going to face the challenge of refining gold one more time!"
<es>

@128
<en>Ran dragged me behind the school gym and told me with newfound determination.
<es>

@129
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Making gold? Ran, you've never even succeeded at normal refinements."
<es>

@130
<en>I'd almost thought that she'd given up on alchemy because she was untalented... so what changed her mind?
<es>

@131
<en>{Ran}\n"That was in the past. This is now, and you don't know until you've tried. It may work this time, you know?"
<es>

@134
<en>{Ran}\n"Besides, I've been feeling lucky lately."
<es>

@135
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Lucky? Well, I don't see anything wrong with trying..."
<es>

@136
<en>We're still young and she's right, it's way too early to give up at our age. If Ran wants to try something, I should be the one supporting her most.
<es>

@137
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay! I got it! I'll help you out!!"
<es>

@138
<en>{Ran}\n"I knew you would! That's my Kazushi!"
<es>

@139
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nothing is impossible! Let's try and succeed this time so we can rake in hordes of that money you love, Ran!"
<es>

@142
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes! Right on!! That's right, Kazushi!"
<es>

@143
<en>Ran happily pounced on me and kissed me on the cheek.
<es>

@146
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, I love you."
<es>

@147
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Love me...?"
<es>

@148
<en>I knew she was half joking, but it made me blush to hear that. And with her this close...
<es>

@150
<en>Then we heard someone approaching.
<es>

@153
<en>{Ran}\n"Someone's coming! Kazushi, over here!!"
<es>

@154
<en>Ran pulled me by the hand.
<es>

@155
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, what are you doing?"
<es>

@156
<en>{Ran}\n"We'd better hide."
<es>

@157
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hide? Where?"
<es>

@158
<en>{Ran}\n"Uh...here!!"
<es>

@159
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Here? Hey..."
<es>

@164
<en>It was completely dark inside, but probably because my eyes hadn't adjusted. There was light filtering in through a gap.
<es>

@165
<en>Ran dragged me inside a vaulting box.
<es>

@166
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There's no need for us to hide in here?"
<es>

@167
<en>{Ran}\n"Hahaha... I was a little carried away, huh?"
<es>

@168
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Come on. Let's get out of here."
<es>

@169
<en>{Ran}\n"No! We should stay here. It'll be more suspicious if we leave now."
<es>

@170
<en>There was still someone out there. I wonder who?
<es>

@171
<en>{Appo}\n"I thought it saw it coming in here..."
<es>

@172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Appo?"
<es>

@173
<en>I peeked through the gap and saw Appo looking for something.
<es>

@174
<en>{Ran}\n"What's he looking for?\nDammit, we're gonna be stuck here for ages."
<es>

@175
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can explain to Appo..."
<es>

@176
<en>{Ran}\n"What kinda explanation are you gonna make like this?"
<es>

@177
<en>She grabbed a hold of my crotch.
<es>

@178
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whoah...h-hey...?"
<es>

@179
<en>Something's off. I thought it felt odd when she grabbed my crotch, and it looked like I was hard.
<es>

@180
<en>{Ran}\n"See? You're still like this. Any explanation you give him is just going to come off as an excuse."
<es>

@181
<en>{Kazushi}\n"True."
<es>

@182
<en>But it wasn't going down soon. No wonder - Ran was pressed up against me like this.
<es>

@183
<en>{Ran}\n"Ah, hey... don't press it against me or you'll start turning me on."
<es>

@184
<en>Ran's voice cracked. Right, I was pressed up against her too. She was getting off too.
<es>

@185
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, Kazushi, can't you calm it down?"
<es>

@186
<en>She poked at my crotch.
<es>

@187
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That makes it worse!"
<es>

@188
<en>{Ran}\n"Then how do make it calm down?"
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Make it come..."
<es>

@190
<en>{Ran}\n"Make it come?"
<es>

@191
<en>Ran gulped and then quickly reached for my pants.
<es>

@192
<en>{Ran}\n"How much have you got on you?"
<es>

@193
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How much...? Don't tell me... Are you planning on doing it here?"
<es>

@194
<en>Oh, come on...
<es>

@195
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How much, then?"
<es>
