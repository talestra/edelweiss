<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think we've done a good job."
<es>

@10
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah, we've done enough."
<es>

@11
<en>In a few more minutes, the date would change. The reason we were here this late was because we were getting the cafeteria decorated for Daigo's birthday party.
<es>

@17
<en>{Haruka}\n"Do you think Daigo-kun will like what we've done?"
<es>

@18
<en>{Ran}\n"We're keeping this a secret, right?"
<es>

@22
<en>{Appo}\n"Yep, I made sure he's been sound asleep all night. I mixed some sleeping pills into his lunch."
<es>

@26
<en>{Rin}\n"Wow, you boys go that far?"
<es>

@30
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Did you really have to go to such extremes? We're doing this to make him happy."
<es>

@31
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry, he's gonna have a good time tomorrow."
<es>

@38
<en>{Appo}\n"It's getting late. Let's wrap it up."
<es>

@39
<en>{Pierre}\n"It's late. Should we walk you girls back to the dorm?"
<es>

@43
<en>{Andou}\n"The wolves say they're going to lead us back."
<es>

@46
<en>{Pierre}\n"The day we did that to you, Andou, is they day we'd all be led to hell."
<es>

@50
<en>{Haruka}\n"Why don't we have a late night snack together before going back?"
<es>

@54
<en>{Rin}\n"I'll make us all some tea."
<es>

@57
<en>Fujisaki-san offered us all some freshly made tea from the kitchen. She'd been in there for ages baking Daigo a cake.
<es>

@58
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fujisaki-san really comes across as feminine. She's so kind and considerate."
<es>

@61
<en>{Pierre}\n"I agree. I feel so relaxed when I talk to her."
<es>

@66
<en>{Haruka}\n"I knew that she's the most popular among you boys."
<es>

@70
<en>{Sakura}\n"Of course she is. Even I'd marry her in an instant. I've got a feeling that she's good in bed, too."
<es>

@71
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about?"
<es>

@74
<en>{Sakura}\n"I'm talking about the many ways she can please a man."
<es>

@78
<en>{Pierre}\n"Are you serious? Her?"
<es>

@82
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Yeah, Rin does wear some incredible underwear. Mine can't compare."
<es>

@86
<en>{Appo}\n"If Fuu-chan's can't compare, they must be amazing. She must be sexier in them than her naked."
<es>

@87
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sexier than when she's naked......"
<es>

@90
<en>I tried imagining that, but unfortunately I didn't have enough information to complete the picture.
<es>

@93
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, hey! Can you keep such crude discussions for when I'm not around?"
<es>

@94
<en>Mizuki couldn't handle this kind of discussion well. Her cheeks were already beet red.
<es>

@99
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You are so innocent. That's so rare these days."
<es>

@102
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Shut up. You're all just too perverted."
<es>

@106
<en>{Andou}\n"How are you ever going to land a boyfriend if you're like this?"
<es>

@109
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't want a boyfriend!"
<es>

@110
<en>Mizuki issued that statement obstinately, pursing her lips.
<es>

@114
<en>{Haruka}\n"You don't want a boyfriend? That's a waste for someone as cute as you are."
<es>

@118
<en>{Sakura}\n"Haruka's right. No wonder people get the wrong idea about you."
<es>

@121
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you talking about?"
<es>

@125
<en>{Rin}\n"Tea's ready. I made barley tea since it's hot."
<es>

@126
<en>Fujisaki-san came in with tea for everyone.
<es>

@130
<en>{Rin}\n"Here's your tea. What were you guys talking about?"
<es>

@131
<en>Rin asked us after setting down the tea cups and looking at Mizuki's frown.
<es>

@137
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What's this wrong idea?"
<es>

@138
<en>Mizuki continued to frown as she sipped her tea.
<es>

@141
<en>{Sakura}\n"...that you're a raging dyke."
<es>

@145
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Pfffffffffffffffffffft?!"
<es>

@146
<en>Mizuki spit out everything she just drank.
<es>

@150
<en>{Rin}\n".................."
<es>

@151
<en>...and splattered it all over Fujisaki-san.
<es>

@156
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wow, Rin's so wet. I want to tease her too!"
<es>

@157
<en>{Rin}\n"Stop it. I'll be really mad if you do so right now."
<es>

@164
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sorry, Rin!\nIt's all your fault, Sakura!"
<es>

@165
<en>{Sakura}\n"I'm just telling you the truth."
<es>

@166
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hold on a second? Who's saying I'm a lesbian?! Who would say such a thing."
<es>

@169
<en>{Rin}\n"I've heard that, too."
<es>

@173
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Everyone thinks you are a lesbian."
<es>

@177
<en>{Andou}\n"Some of the girls even think you're taking advantage of the naive freshmen in your fan club."
<es>

@178
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's ridiculous! I'm not doing anything to them!"
<es>

@182
<en>{Sakura}\n"But you don't show any interests in boys."
<es>

@186
<en>{Ran}\n"You didn't show any interest in it even when I offered to introduce you to some."
<es>

@189
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I just wasn't interested in financing your business! I am interested in boys!"
<es>

@190
<en>{Sakura}\n"Huh? I thought you said earlier that you weren't interested in boys."
<es>

@191
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I am now!"
<es>

@195
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh, you've said it!"
<es>

@199
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Then you've already got someone in mind?"
<es>

@200
<en>Fuusen asked the exact question us boys had on our minds.
<es>

@203
<en>{Mizuki}\n"W-well...... yes I do."
<es>

@204
<en>Mizuki was under pressure and replied defiantly.
<es>

@208
<en>{Haruka}\n"What? Wow! You do! Who is it?"
<es>

@209
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I-it's......"
<es>

@210
<en>Mizuki was in trouble. That was definitely a lie. She only said she had someone in mind because she couldn't take it anymore.
<es>

@211
<en>I'd done that before.
<es>

@215
<en>{Sakura}\n"You're lying, right? We won't get mad; just tell us the truth."
<es>

@218
<en>{Mizuki}\n"...I'm not lying.\nAs a matter of fact, we're already going out."
<es>

@219
<en>Oh no, now she's done it. She's definitely lying.
<es>

@223
<en>{Rin}\n"We? Mizuki-chan, you already have a boyfriend? Who is he? Someone in our class?"
<es>

@226
<en>{Mizuki}\n"He is......"
<es>

@227
<en>Ouch... Nothing's more painful to watch than someone who continues to lie when everyone knows they are.
<es>

@231
<en>{Ran}\n"Who is it? Tell us."
<es>

@232
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Umm......"
<es>

@233
<en>She was glancing around.\nI can't watch this anymore......
<es>
