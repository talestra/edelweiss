@8
<en>One of the room's light is still on.\nI wonder who is still in there so late.\nThat room must be......
<es>

@9
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's got to be library."
<es>

@10
<en>I have a feeling the person I'm looking for is in that room.
<es>

@15
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good evening-"
<es>

@19
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi?\nWhat are you doing here so late?"
<es>

@20
<en>I knew she was here.
<es>

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's what I wanted to ask you."
<es>

@22
<en>I realized she is in her casual clothes.\nShe must have gone back to her room once.
<es>

@25
<en>{Mei}\n"I was doing a little research."
<es>

@26
<en>She was reading a thick dictionary.\nIt must be related to Alchemy.
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you perhaps studying now?"
<es>

@28
<en>{Mei}\n"I dodn't have to do it tonight,\nbut I just don't feel good leaving it unfinished."
<es>

@29
<en>That's so like her.\nShe is a very puntual person.
<es>

@30
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If it was me,\nI sure won't do it tonight and maybe even forget about it tomorrow."
<es>

@31
<en>I can clearly picture myself doing that.
<es>

@34
<en>{Mei}\n"That's actually better.\nThey say great man don't get bothered by small stuff."
<es>

@35
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that true?\nI don't know. I'm just lazy."
<es>

@37
<en>I looked into what she was reading.
<es>

@38
<en>It was not written in Japanese so I couldn't understand anything.\nThere were a lots of old pictures.
<es>

@39
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is this picture?"
<es>

@40
<en>It was a picture of a baby inside a glass bottle.
<es>

@43
<en>{Mei}\n"Didn't I teach you guys yet?\nIt's the picture of "Homonculous"."
<es>

@44
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Homon.......what?"
<es>

@45
<en>I think I've heard it somewhere before.
<es>

@48
<en>{Mei}\n"You might really be the great man one day.\nNobody remembers tiny thing like that."
<es>

@49
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry......\nI'm sure I've heard of it somewhere before."
<es>

@50
<en>Actually I'm not so sure.\nI sleep during the class when the subject gets boaring.
<es>

@53
<en>{Mei}\n""Homonculous"is the artificial life created by Alchemy."
<es>

@54
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Artificial life?"
<es>

@55
<en>I look at the picture once again.\nThere is a tiny person inside the bottle.\nThis is just like......
<es>

@56
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Remember how Natsume came out from the pot in the bottle?"
<es>

@57
<en>Natsume was in the glassbottle when she came out.\nShe appeared from out of nowhere.
<es>

@58
<en>That was exactly the case of this picture.
<es>

@59
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So she is "Homonculous"?"
<es>

@62
<en>{Mei}\n"That, I don't know.\nI've never seen a "Homonculous"in complete figure as she is."
<es>

@63
<en>Yeah, it's hard to think that she was given birth at that spot.\nShe was fully grown when she came out already.
<es>

@64
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, what is she?"
<es>

@67
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't know either.\nShe could be "Homonculous"."
<es>

@68
<en>Ms, Ibuki doesn't know either.\nI wonder what the principal made through that experiment.
<es>

@69
<en>We don't even know if the experiment was a success or the failure.
<es>

@72
<en>{Mei}\n"However, a long ago, I know this school used to practice experiments on "Homonculous".\nSo there is a possibility."
<es>

@73
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This school used to......?"
<es>

@75
<en>I thought Alchemy we learn in this school is for to better everyday life, like producing delicious vegetables and fruits.
<es>

@77
<en>Nothing like witchcraft we are talking here.
<es>

@78
<en>{Kazushi}\n"why did they want to experiment "Homonculous"?"
<es>

@81
<en>{Mei}\n"I think human being always try to find the way to be god.\nLike how gods created us."
<es>

@82
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You think we can really find the way?"
<es>

@83
<en>I don't think so.\nAnd I don't want to think so.
<es>

@86
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't thnk so either."
<es>

@87
<en>I felt so relieved she is with me on this one.
<es>

@89
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sure she need time to get used to a new environment. Please take care of her, because she seems to be attached to you."
<es>

@91
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, for some reason."
<es>

@92
<en>I really don't know why.
<es>

@93
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, don't worry.\nI will take care of her."
<es>

@96
<en>{Mei}\n"Thank you.\nShall we go back now?"
<es>

@97
<en>She checks the time with a clock on the wall.\nIt's still early for me to go back.
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Give me one minute."
<es>

@99
<en>It hasn't even been an hour since I came out from my room.
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I actually can't go back to my room for two hours.\nCan you spend time with me?"
<es>

@103
<en>{Mei}\n"Exactly two hours?\nWhy is it so specific?"
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's a long story......"
<es>

@105
<en>{Mei}\n"Are you guys doing something bad again?\nCan I go check your room?"
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh no!\nYou seriously don't want to do that!\nI don't want you to be traumatized!"
<es>

@109
<en>{Mei}\n"What do you mean?\nI don't understand you."
<es>

@110
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please just trust me on this one."
<es>
