<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where is she?"
<es>

@9
<en>I went to her dorm. She wasn't in her room.\nI wonder where she is so late at night?
<es>

@10
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......?"
<es>

@12
<en>I sensed someone in the dark.
<es>

@13
<en>I saw shadows in the corner of the campus.
<es>

@16
<en>{Ran}\n"Why you need me so late at night?"
<es>

@17
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's Ran' voice."
<es>

@18
<en>I could tell it's her voice.\nThere is one more person.\nIt's a guy.
<es>

@19
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are they doing here so late?"
<es>

@20
<en>I don't know why, but I couldn't help hiding to see what's going on.
<es>

@21
<en>{A guy}\n"Umm......., are you going out with anyome now?"
<es>

@22
<en>Wow......!!\nIs he asking her out?
<es>

@25
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Sure I do."
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What......?"
<es>

@28
<en>Opps, I have to be quiet.\nDid she just say "yes"?
<es>

@29
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who is she talking about?"
<es>

@30
<en>I didn't know she had a boyfriend.\nI mean she didn't have to tell me,\nbut I wonder who that is.
<es>

@31
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why do I feel this way?"
<es>

@34
<en>{A guy}\n"......who is your boyfriend?"
<es>

@35
<en>That's right.\nAsk her.
<es>

@38
<en>{Ran}\n"Why do you care?\nI should start charging you if you still want me to hang around."
<es>

@39
<en>{A guy}\n"You are gonna charge me!?"
<es>

@40
<en>I don't blame him being surprised.\nWho would have to pay to get a chance to ask out a girl.
<es>

@41
<en>{A guy}\n"All right! I will pay 10 bucks!\nTell me who you're going out with!"
<es>

@42
<en>He is paying!?\nThat guy is going to pay 10 bucks just to find out who she's going out with?
<es>

@45
<en>{Ran}\n"10 bucks.......\nAll right, deal.\nGive it to me."
<es>

@48
<en>Ran is all smiling now.\nThis is so wrong.
<es>

@49
<en>{Ran}\n"Thanks-!\nAll right, get closer."
<es>

@51
<en>She whispers to his ear.\nShit! I can't hear her.
<es>

@52
<en>{A guy}\n"I knew it.\nI knew you guys are not just friends."
<es>

@55
<en>{Ran}\n"Well. I'm sorry. But I can introduce you pretty girls. There is this cute freshman......you wanna see her picture?"
<es>

@56
<en>{A guy}\n"Wow! She's pretty!!\nIntroduce her to me!!"
<es>

@57
<en>He wants Ran to introduce a new girl......?\nWhat kind a man asks a girl who just rejected him to introduce another girl?
<es>

@60
<en>{Ran}\n"That will be 30 bucks.\nIf you want a date with her,\nit will be $ 59.95."
<es>

@61
<en>She's charging him again.
<es>

@62
<en>{A guy}\n"I want a date!"
<es>

@63
<en>He placed an order.
<es>

@66
<en>{Ran}\n"Sure-! I will introduce her to you tomorrow lunch."
<es>

@67
<en>{A guy}\n"That will be a homerun!"
<es>

@69
<en>What a loser.
<es>

@71
<en>{Ran}\n"! It feels good to help people-"
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You call that "helping people"?"
<es>

@73
<en>I couldn't help wanting to lecture her.
<es>

@78
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, hey kazushi- what's up?"
<es>

@79
<en>She seems to not have any guilty feeling what's so ever.
<es>

@80
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I was watching the whole thing."
<es>

@83
<en>{Ran}\n"You did?\nDon't worry- I rejected him."
<es>

@84
<en>She doesn't look like she just broke someone's heart.
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are such a terrible person.\nHow could you introduce another girl to someone you just rejected?"
<es>

@88
<en>{Ran}\n"Why is that so bad?\nMy customer went home happy."
<es>

@89
<en>In her mind, he's only a customer.
<es>

@90
<en>{Ran}\n"I didn't want to go out with him.\nAnd I'm sure he wants to make a girlfriend soon.\nSo I'll introduce him other girls"
<es>

@91
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well,\nI see your point."
<es>

@92
<en>Maybe she acted upon thoughtful purposes.
<es>

@93
<en>{Kazushi}\n"By the way, who is your boyfriend?"
<es>

@94
<en>{Ran}\n"My boyfriend?"
<es>

@95
<en>She seems like she has no idea what I'm talking about.
<es>

@96
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You were charging the poor guy 10 bucks to tell him who you are going out with just a minute ago."
<es>

@99
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, that!\nThat's you Kazushi."
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Me?"
<es>

@101
<en>I see. That was me who she was going out with.
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait a minute, are we going out?"
<es>

@105
<en>{Ran}\n"Kind of."
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Kind of?"
<es>

@107
<en>{Ran}\n"Besides, it's the easiest way to reject guys.\nThey give up easily once they find out the girl's going out with someone already."
<es>

@108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"And you're using my name to make quick cash."
<es>

@111
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't get so bothered by this.\nI actually like you-"
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not sure if I should be happy."
<es>

@113
<en>According to her,\nshe had to reject guys often.\nI didn't know she was so popular.
<es>

@114
<en>But she seems to have no interests in going out with boys.\nPerhaps, is she a lesbian?
<es>

@117
<en>{Ran}\n"What are you thinking so hard?\nRelax and take a walk with me."
<es>

@120
<en>She puts her arm around mine.\nI can feel her breasts.
<es>

@123
<en>{Ran}\n"You should be honored.\nYou are the only one I don't charge for this."
<es>

@124
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm still not sure if I should be happy."
<es>

@125
<en>With her, I don't get horny even taking a walk like this. But, that's probably why I feel relaxed around her.
<es>

@126
<en>However, I definitely want a girlfriend before the summer break.
<es>

@127
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh hey, will you introduce girls for me too?"
<es>

@130
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Why?"
<es>

@131
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Was it 30 bucks? I don't mind paying that......"
<es>

@132
<en>I checked inside my wallet.\nMy budget is pretty tight right now.
<es>

@133
<en>{Ran}\n"What? You wanted a girlfriend?"
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why are you so surprised?\nWhat do you think why I came to this island?\nIt's all because of that."
<es>

@137
<en>{Ran}\n"I see. I didn't know you are so ordinary."
<es>

@138
<en>For some reason,\nshe seems disappointed.
<es>

@139
<en>{Ran}\n"You shouldn't worry about that too much.\nI can see you falling for a wrong girl losing all your money for her."
<es>

@140
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't believe that's coming out from your mouth.\nJust show me some of the pictures.\nI prefer freshmen."
<es>

@143
<en>{Ran}\n"No, no, not for you.\nThis is not for someone like you."
<es>

@144
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why not?\nYou want me to be a loser forever."
<es>

@147
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't worry.\nI will make you happy-"
<es>

@148
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It sounds very expensive."
<es>

@149
<en>{Ran}\n"Might be- you should start saving-"
<es>

@150
<en>I was really looking forward for her to introduce me some pretty girls.
<es>

@151
<en>Oh well.\nI'm happy enough everyday.
<es>
