<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where could Ran be?"
<es>

@9
<en>I went by her dorm, but she wasn't in her room.\nI wonder where she is so late at night?
<es>

@10
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@12
<en>I sensed someone in the dark.
<es>

@13
<en>I saw shadows in the corner of the quad.
<es>

@16
<en>{Ran}\n"Why do you need me so late at night?"
<es>

@17
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's Ran's voice."
<es>

@18
<en>I could tell it was her voice.\nThere was someone else with her - a guy I didn't recognize.
<es>

@19
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are they doing here so late?"
<es>

@20
<en>I don't know why, but I couldn't help hiding behind a bush and watching them.
<es>

@21
<en>{Guy}\n"Umm...are you going out with anyone right now?"
<es>

@22
<en>Wow......!!\nIs he asking her out?
<es>

@25
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Sure I am."
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!?"
<es>

@28
<en>Ack, I need to stay quiet.\n...wait, did she just say "yes"?
<es>

@29
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who is she talking about?"
<es>

@30
<en>I didn't know that Ran had a boyfriend.\nI mean, she didn't have to tell me, but I wonder who he is.
<es>

@31
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is this feeling?"
<es>

@34
<en>{Guy}\n"Who's your boyfriend?"
<es>

@35
<en>That's right. Ask her. I need to know.
<es>

@38
<en>{Ran}\n"What's it to you? If you plan on taking much longer, I'll start charging by the hour."
<es>

@39
<en>{Guy}\n"You're gonna charge me?"
<es>

@40
<en>I don't blame him for being surprised. Who'd want to pay to get a chance at asking a girl out?
<es>

@41
<en>{Guy}\n"All right! I'll pay 1000 yen! At least tell me who you're going out with!"
<es>

@42
<en>He's actually paying her!? That guy is seriously paying Ran 1000 yen just to find out who her boyfriend is?
<es>

@45
<en>{Ran}\n"1000 yen?\nAll right, deal. Give it to me."
<es>

@48
<en>The guy handed Ran 1,000 yen and she was all smiles. This is so wrong.
<es>

@49
<en>{Ran}\n"Thank you, come again! Now, lend me your ear."
<es>

@51
<en>She whispered into his ear. Shit! I can't hear it.
<es>

@52
<en>{Guy}\n"I knew it! I knew you two were more than just friends."
<es>

@55
<en>{Ran}\n"Well, that's how it is, so give up on me. In exchange, I'll introduce you to another girl. There's this cute first year - wanna see her picture?"
<es>

@56
<en>{Guy}\n"Wow! She's pretty? You've gotta introduce us!"
<es>

@57
<en>He wants Ran to introduce him to another girl? What kind of man asks the girl who just rejected him to arrange a hookup with someone else?
<es>

@60
<en>{Ran}\n"That'll be 3000 yen for the introduction. I can set you up with a date for 5980 yen."
<es>

@61
<en>She's charging him again. A pretty high rate too.
<es>

@62
<en>{Guy}\n"I want a date, please!"
<es>

@63
<en>He placed an order.
<es>

@66
<en>{Ran}\n"Thank you, come again. I'll introduce you to her tomorrow during lunch."
<es>

@67
<en>{Guy}\n"Yes! I'm gonna score a home run!"
<es>

@69
<en>That guy went home so happy that even I felt ashamed. What the hell did he come here for.
<es>

@71
<en>{Ran}\n"It feels good to help people."
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You call that "helping people"?"
<es>

@73
<en>I couldn't help wanting to lecture her.
<es>

@78
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, hey Kazushi. What's up?"
<es>

@79
<en>She didn't seem to have any guilty feelings whatsoever.
<es>

@80
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I was watching the whole thing."
<es>

@83
<en>{Ran}\n"You were? Don't worry, I rejected him."
<es>

@84
<en>She doesn't look like she just broke someone's heart.
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are such a terrible person.\nHow could you introduce another girl to someone you just rejected AND charge them for it?"
<es>

@88
<en>{Ran}\n"Why is that so bad? My customer went home happy."
<es>

@89
<en>In her mind, he's only a customer.
<es>

@90
<en>{Ran}\n"I can't go out with him, and he didn't care who it was - he just wanted a girlfriend to spend summer with. Leading him to his next chance is better than leaving him dumped."
<es>

@91
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I see your point."
<es>

@92
<en>Maybe she really did act with an altruistic purpose.
<es>

@93
<en>{Kazushi}\n"By the way, who's the guy you're seeing?"
<es>

@94
<en>{Ran}\n"The guy I'm seeing?"
<es>

@95
<en>She responded like she had no idea what I was talking about.
<es>

@96
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You know, you just charged that poor guy 1000 yen to find out who your boyfriend was."
<es>

@99
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, that? I was talking about you, Kazushi."
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Me?"
<es>

@101
<en>I see. That means she's going out with me.
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait a minute, are we going out?"
<es>

@105
<en>{Ran}\n"Kind of."
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Kind of?"
<es>

@107
<en>{Ran}\n"Telling them you've already got a boyfriend is the quickest way to make guys give up. It also helps lead them into things like just now."
<es>

@108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So you're using my name to make some quick cash."
<es>

@111
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't get so upset about it. Besides, I really do like you."
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not sure if I should be happy about that or not."
<es>

@113
<en>According to Ran, she had to reject guys all the time. I didn't know she was so popular...
<es>

@114
<en>But then, she doesn't seem to have any interest in going out with the boys either. Maybe she's actually a lesbian?
<es>

@117
<en>{Ran}\n"What are you thinking so hard about? Loosen up and take a walk with me."
<es>

@120
<en>She looped her arm around mine and held my hand.\nI could feel her breasts squishing against my arms.
<es>

@123
<en>{Ran}\n"You should feel honoured. You're the only guy I don't charge for this."
<es>

@124
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm still not sure if I should be happy about this or not."
<es>

@125
<en>With Ran, I don't even get turned on when we're this close and going for a walk. But that's also probably why I feel so relaxed around her.
<es>

@126
<en>However, I definitely want a girlfriend before summer break.
<es>

@127
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, hey, would you introduce me to some girls, too?"
<es>

@130
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Why?"
<es>

@131
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You wanted 3000 yen, right? I don't mind paying that..."
<es>

@132
<en>I checked inside my wallet.\nMy budget is pretty tight right now.
<es>

@133
<en>{Ran}\n"What? You want a girlfriend?"
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why's that such a surprise?\nWhy do you think we all came to this island? All of us wanted to meet girls."
<es>

@137
<en>{Ran}\n"I see. I didn't know you were such a normal guy."
<es>

@138
<en>For some reason she sounded disappointed.
<es>

@139
<en>{Ran}\n"You shouldn't worry about finding a girlfriend so much. I can see you falling for the wrong girl and letting her soak you for all your cash."
<es>

@140
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't believe a business oriented girl like you is saying things like that. Just show me some of the pictures... I prefer first years, by the way."
<es>

@143
<en>{Ran}\n"No. No, no, no. This is not a service for someone like you."
<es>

@144
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why not? Do you want me to be a loser forever?"
<es>

@147
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't worry. I'll make you happy."
<es>

@148
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That sounds like it's out of my price range."
<es>

@149
<en>{Ran}\n"Maybe you should start saving while you've got the chance."
<es>

@150
<en>I was really looking forward to her introducing me to some pretty girls.
<es>

@151
<en>Oh well.\nI'm happy enough for now.
<es>
