@8
<en>I stopped walking because I could hear a washing machine.
<es>

@9
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who'd be doing their laundry so late?"
<es>

@10
<en>I peeked inside the laundry room.\nThere was Mizuki - the person I was looking for.
<es>

@14
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, hey Kazushi."
<es>

@15
<en>She seems uncomfortable. I wonder why.
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why are you doing your laundry so late at night?"
<es>

@19
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Is it really so weird? Don't you always want to wash your swimsuit right after you're done?"
<es>

@20
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see.\n...huh? Does that mean you went swimming today too?"
<es>

@23
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Of course.\nI went for a swim after exams were done."
<es>

@24
<en>Wow, I thought I had a long day after last night. I can't believe she had so much spare energy.
<es>

@25
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm amazed. You sat through exams after pulling an all-nighter, PLUS you found the strength to swim afterwards. You're a really tough girl."
<es>

@28
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahaha, I find it more relaxing in the water. People can float, so you can just lay back and drift along."
<es>

@29
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's how it works for you?"
<es>

@30
<en>For someone who can't swim (like me), it's hard to believe that.
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...Hmm?"
<es>

@33
<en>There was something on the floor. It looked like a handkerchief. I guess someone dropped it.
<es>

@34
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this your hanky?"
<es>

@35
<en>I realized what it actually was when I unfolded it and stretched it out.
<es>

@36
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...um..."
<es>

@39
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey!!"
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's your panties!!"
<es>

@46
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Gghah?!"
<es>

@47
<en>I felt something heavy striking my face, knocking me back.
<es>

@50
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Give those back to me!"
<es>

@51
<en>As I lay on the ground twitching, she took her panties back.
<es>

@52
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You didn't have to punch me over it! That hurt!"
<es>

@53
<en>I think she broke my nose...
<es>

@54
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's your fault!\nHow dare you go touching my underwear!?"
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How was I supposed to know?! I never thought panties would be lying on the floor! And if you don't want anyone to see them, then don't drop them there!"
<es>

@56
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well this IS the laundry room, in case you haven't noticed."
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I thought you were washing your swimsuit!"
<es>

@60
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well, I had some other dirty clothes, too..."
<es>

@63
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Why am I even telling you this!?"
<es>

@64
<en>Her cheeks suddenly blushed in embarrassment.
<es>

@65
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't ask you to! So you wash your swimsuit every day but not your underwear or regular clothes?"
<es>

@68
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Doing laundry everyday gets annoying...\nAnyways, I told you not to make me talk about this stuff!"
<es>

@69
<en>Suddenly, she'd gotten very shy. I knew she wasn't good with dirty topics, but underwear too?
<es>

@70
<en>I bet she's covering it up.
<es>

@73
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are you staring at me with those eyes for?\nYou pervert!"
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You think I'm a pervert?"
<es>

@77
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Every time I talk to you, it always ends up being about sex!"
<es>

@78
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't think we were talking about sex.\nWould you please calm down?"
<es>

@79
<en>She's turning flustered. She could trip over herself at any moment.
<es>

@80
<en>{Mizuki}\n"...ah!"
<es>

@83
<en>Just as I expected, she tripped and fell on her butt.
<es>

@84
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wha!?"
<es>

@85
<en>Naturally, her legs spread out when she fell, slipping up her short skirt and leaving her crotch completely exposed to me.
<es>

@86
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why aren't you wearing underwear!?"
<es>

@87
<en>Nope, no underwear at all. I had a clear view of every little bit.
<es>

@90
<en>{Mizuki}\n"N......NOOOOOOOOOOO!!"
<es>

@91
<en>Too late to hide it now.
<es>

@92
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Y-you saw it, right?\nHow did you see it again!!?"
<es>

@93
<en>She started crying.
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How is this my fault?\nWhy aren't you wearing underwear?"
<es>

@95
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I was washing them!"
<es>

@96
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't wash the ones you have one!"
<es>

@97
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How could I have known you'd see me?!"
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I never thought I'd get to see it either!"
<es>

@101
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How well could you see it?"
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How well......?"
<es>

@103
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You saw what you didn't see the first time?"
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ummm......"
<es>

@106
<en>I tried to see what I could remember. There was a single modest line. Mizuki's looked like a beautiful pair of lips.
<es>

@108
<en>*nosebleed*
<es>

@109
<en>{Kazushi}\n"AH!"
<es>

@112
<en>Blood came dripping from my nose.\nMizuki was horrified.
<es>

@113
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No!\nYou saw it everything, didn't you!?\nI can't believe this!!"
<es>

@114
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry! It was an accident!"
<es>

@117
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi!\nYou go to hell!"
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry! Forgive me!"
<es>

@121
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I don't want to live anymore! If the button to launch a nuke was in front of me right now, I'd press it."
<es>

@122
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Forget it! Try to forget everything that just happened!"
<es>

@123
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'll try."
<es>

@124
<en>I won't. That was the most impressive sight I've ever seen.
<es>
