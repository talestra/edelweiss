<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh! Hi, Kazushi-kun!"
<es>

@11
<en>I saw Haruka running towards me as I was on my way to the girls' dorm.
<es>

@14
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What a coincidence! I was just thinking about coming to see you."
<es>

@18
<en>{Haruka}\n"You were on your way to visit me? How funny that we've met halfway!"
<es>

@19
<en>I couldn't help but cheer up as I saw her getting all excited by the prospect of my visit.
<es>

@20
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're giving me the wrong impression."
<es>

@23
<en>{Haruka}\n"Wrong impression? What wrong impression?"
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's nothing."
<es>

@25
<en>I wonder if she harbors any special feelings for me.
<es>

@26
<en>I doubt it. She's equally nice to everyone, and treats them the same. That's one of her best traits.
<es>

@27
<en>{Haruka}\n"Are you free? Would you like to go for a walk?"
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't say that first. I was about to invite you for one."
<es>

@31
<en>{Haruka}\n"You were going to ask me out for a walk? I missed my chance at being asked out!!! Uwaa! Can you ask me now?"
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You want me to ask you now? Ok...... \nDo you want to take a walk with me?"
<es>

@35
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sure!"
<es>

@36
<en>She gave me a big smile as she started walking.
<es>

@37
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hurry up, Kazushi-kun, or I'm going to leave you behind!"
<es>

@39
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hold on."
<es>

@42
<en>I chased after Haruka as she walked towards a beautiful full moon.
<es>

@46
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's scary here at night."
<es>

@47
<en>We definitely stayed in the classroom last night. I just hadn't thought much of it with everyone there.
<es>

@48
<en>I just hadn't thought much of it with everyone there.
<es>

@51
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm so relieved that everything turned out fine last night."
<es>

@52
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Me too. It's because we all worked at it together."
<es>

@55
<en>{Haruka}\n"You're right. I'm just happy that everyone's finally getting along well."
<es>

@56
<en>Her smile had put smiles on everyone else's faces. However, it disappeared the very next moment.
<es>

@59
<en>{Haruka}\n"I still don't understand why grandma did such a..."
<es>

@60
<en>She was mumbling to herself as she looked down at the ground. I could barely hear her.
<es>

@61
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You mean last night? What about your grandma?"
<es>

@64
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's nothing. I was just talking to myself."
<es>

@65
<en>She's clearly dodging the issue. Haruka's never shown herself to be a good liar.
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If there's ever, ever anything troubling you, you know you can talk to me, right?"
<es>

@67
<en>I didn't want to force her into talking...\nBut I truly wanted to be of help to her if she needed me.
<es>

@70
<en>Haruka looked into my eyes.
<es>

@71
<en>{Haruka}\n"Thanks.\nI'm OK now, but if I ever need your help I'll come and find you."
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You do that. I'll do everything I can for you."
<es>

@75
<en>{Haruka}\n"You're making me blush."
<es>

@76
<en>She's smiling again. Her smile makes me feel safe for some reason.
<es>

@77
<en>{Haruka}\n"You do the same, OK, Kazushi-kun? I'll do everything I can to help you."
<es>

@78
<en>Her pure smile touched my heart.
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're going to protect me?"
<es>

@82
<en>{Haruka}\n"Of course I will! Whenever you need me, I'll be there."
<es>

@83
<en>I felt a sense of commitment and dedication in her words...
<es>

@84
<en>As if she knew something was going to happen......
<es>

@87
<en>{Haruka}\n"Summer break is just around the corner. We're gonna have so much fun!"
<es>

@88
<en>She started smiling again.
<es>

@89
<en>I couldn't help but smile back at her.
<es>

@90
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yup! We're gonna rock till we drop!"
<es>

@91
<en>{Haruka}\n"We will!"
<es>

@92
<en>I have a feeling this summer is going to be very different from my previous ones. I can't wait.
