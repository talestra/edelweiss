@11
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How is he?"
<es>

@16
<en>{Rin}\n"He's asleep. Or at least he's lying down with his eyes closed?"
<es>

@23
<en>{Ran}\n"He's not going to follow after her, is he?"
<es>

@26
<en>{Rin}\n"What? H-he should be alright..."
<es>

@32
<en>{Daigo}\n"He ate dinner, so he should be fine."
<es>

@37
<en>{Pierre}\n"He's going to be all right. Especially after how much he cried."
<es>

@42
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Yeah, but he just accepted Haruka's death at last today. The real pain's going to start from now on."
<es>

@47
<en>{Appo}\n"He'll be okay. We're here for him."
<es>

@52
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'll keep my eye on him."
<es>

@55
<en>I could hear everything they were whispering. I know they were trying to hide and peek in on me, but it was plain to see.
<es>

@56
<en>Still it felt good. It made me feel at ease to listen to them and know that they were watching over me.
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka..."
<es>

@58
<en>I cried like an idiot and felt better, but I also felt depressed again.
<es>

@59
<en>The fact that Haruka was gone still hadn't changed.
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"............"
<es>

@61
<en>There was still a faint trace of Haruka's scent left on her bed. It was so faint that I doubt anyone else would notice it.
<es>

@62
<en>And this faint scent too will disappear soon.
<es>

@63
<en>I haven't gotten much sleep lately, so it shouldn't be difficult for me to fall asleep with my eyes closed. But for some reason, I can't sleep at all.
<es>

@64
<en>I'm afraid of sleeping. If I go to sleep, I'll have to wake up to a world where Haruka's not around.
<es>

@65
<en>When I woke, that would be the first thing I realized, and I'd be in despair again. I wouldn't want to wake up anymore. And that scared me.
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka..."
<es>

@67
<en>I called her dear name.
<es>

@70
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahh, Haruka..."
<es>

@72
<en>Haruka had melted away. It must have been an illusion my nearly-crazy mind created.
<es>

@73
<en>But this is how things should be: A world without Haruka.
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess you won't stay by my side, will you Haruka?"
<es>

@75
<en>I was becoming enveloped in despair. It felt like I was falling into a deep, bottomless pit, and I was terrified.
<es>

@76
<en>But I'm not falling anymore. Everyone else is here, supporting me.
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka..."
<es>

@79
<en>That night, I fell into a deep sleep. And I had a dream.
<es>

@85
<en>{Haruka}\n"Are you gonna go right after graduation?"
<es>

@86
<en>I'm not sure what she's asking.
<es>

@87
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Go where?"
<es>

@88
<en>{Haruka}\n"Abroad. You said you wanted to go, right?"
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@90
<en>I promised I'd go with her, that I would take Haruka off of this island and we would travel the broad world together.
<es>

@91
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We need to earn some money first. Then once I have my driver's license, and we have more money stored up, then..."
<es>

@92
<en>I felt like there was still a lot to prepare. I only had a vague idea before, but after meeting Haruka, it's grown more tangible.
<es>

@93
<en>Yet that only made it seem more unrealistic in my mind. I didn't even have a good idea of what else needed to be prepared.
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It looks like it's going to take some time."
<es>

@97
<en>{Haruka}\n"I see. It will take a lot of money, won't it? But if we both work hard, it won't take long."
<es>

@98
<en>Haruka was skipping with excitement, even though all we did was reaffirm our distant goal.
<es>

@99
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You look so happy, Haruka."
<es>

@102
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yes, I am. Because now I have a goal to achieve. No, it's more of a dream."
<es>

@103
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A dream? You make it sound like you've never had one before."
<es>

@104
<en>{Haruka}\n"Well, no. I haven't, really."
<es>

@105
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? What about becoming an alchemist, like the principal?"
<es>

@106
<en>{Haruka}\n"That was more real than a dream I guess. I studied every day, and it was just the result of that. So it didn't really feel like a dream."
<es>

@107
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah?"
<es>

@110
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh, yes. And..."
<es>

@111
<en>Suddenly, Haruka's tone fell.
<es>

@114
<en>{Haruka}\n"It was all more, 'I have to do this,' rather than 'it would be nice to do this.' It was the same with my grandma."
<es>

@117
<en>{Haruka}\n"But then I met you, Kazushi-kun, and I finally though 'it would be nice to do this someday.' That's why every day is so much fun."
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's fun for me too."
<es>

@119
<en>I never really thought about the fact that every day was fun before I met Haruka. That's all different now, though.
<es>

@120
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm happy today, and looking forward to tomorrow too. Because today, tomorrow, and the day after will all lead to that 'someday'."
<es>

@123
<en>{Haruka}\n"You're the one who showed me that dream, Kazushi-kun. No, you've become my dream."
<es>

@124
<en>Her shining eyes looked straight at me.\nWhat beautiful, bright eyes they are!
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're embarrassing me!"
<es>

@128
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ahaha. Sorry. I'm embarrassed too."
<es>

@129
<en>Haruka fidgeted, her cheeks flushed, and I blushed too. The sea breeze gently caressed our warm cheeks.
<es>

@132
<en>{Haruka}\n"Let's go some day. You and me. Promise?"
<es>

@133
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure. Promise. I will take you there, no matter what."
<es>

@134
<en>{Haruka}\n"Thanks."
<es>

@135
<en>Holding hands together, we watched the ocean for a long time while imagining the world beyond the horizon.
<es>

@143
<en>I woke up with a hint of Haruka's sweet scent in my nose.
<es>

@144
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...............A dream, huh?"
<es>

@145
<en>A dream about just one month ago, when we were happy. Every day was fun, and we couldn't wait for tomorrow. A complete 180 from today.
<es>

@146
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Our promise, huh..."
<es>

@147
<en>I'll take you off this island. I'll introduce you to my family. We'll go on a journey together......
<es>

@148
<en>Haruka had been looking forward to all of that, and yet I couldn't make her dream come true.
<es>

@149
<en>Is it impossible to fulfill my promises to her now? What can I even do for her now?
<es>

@154
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So beautiful."
<es>

@155
<en>With all of those white flowers blooming at once, it looked like a pure white carpet. The flowers that rarely bloom were blooming everywhere, just like when I first met Haruka.
<es>

@156
<en>{Principal}\n"This is so amazing, isn't it?"
<es>

@157
<en>I heard someone's softly surprised voice.
<es>

@160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei."
<es>

@161
<en>It was the principal. She walked through the flowers to come towards me.
<es>

@162
<en>{Principal}\n"They are very special flowers. It's not easy to get them bloom like this, even when you try to make them. But your friends did it quite simply."
<es>

@163
<en>Haruka also said these white flowers were very special.
<es>

@164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They're all incredible guys."
<es>

@165
<en>While I wandered through the darkness, they made sure to protect the flowers Haruka cherished. And they even pulled me back off the wrong path.
<es>

@166
<en>I have so much respect for them.
<es>

@169
<en>{Principal}\n"By seeing these flowers, I can tell how much and how earnestly they love you and Haruka."
<es>

@170
<en>{Principal}\n"Haruka was a very lucky girl to have friends like them."
<es>

@171
<en>The principal quietly stared at the blooming flowers, her eyes full of regret for the things she never noticed before.
<es>

@174
<en>{Principal}\n"I should have paid more attention to her. My eyes were completely clouded."
<es>

@175
<en>The principal chuckled a bit. I knew she was blaming herself.
<es>

@176
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please don't blame yourself."
<es>

@177
<en>I knew how the principal felt. I would have continued on the same path as hers had I been alone.
<es>

@178
<en>However, my friends were there for me, just as Haruka had been there for the principal.
<es>

@179
<en>But now Haruka was gone.
<es>

@182
<en>{Principal}\n"I'm okay......It's just started sinking in that I'm now completely alone."
<es>

@183
<en>The principal smiled warmly, yet sadly. I never knew that she could smile like that, and my heart ached to see such a gentle smile on her exhausted face.
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But you have a son, right?"
<es>

@185
<en>Her son - Haruka's father. He must have come to the funeral, but I didn't get to see him since I couldn't bring myself to go to the ceremony.
<es>

@188
<en>{Principal}\n"I fear that I have lost contact with him completely after this tragedy. He's never liked alchemy to begin with. Maybe he genuinely hates it now."
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sorry to hear that..."
<es>

@190
<en>He'd reluctantly let Haruka come to this academy because it was Haruka's only wish to learn alchemy. But when this was the result, who would blame him.
<es>

@191
<en>{Principal}\n"Everyone in my family has left me. Maybe this is a punishment from god."
<es>

@192
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, please don't say that."
<es>

@193
<en>{Principal}\n"Well, being alone may not be as bad as I think. Besides, there's nobody left in my family to lose."
<es>

@194
<en>Her eyes told me that the principal had given up on everything. Haruka wouldn't have wanted to see her grandma like this. I couldn't just leave her alone...
<es>

@195
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then...\nI will become your grandson!"
<es>

@198
<en>{Principal}\n"What? You...my grandson?"
<es>

@199
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why not? I was planning to be, anyways. I was very serious about being with Haruka."
<es>

@200
<en>{Principal}\n"No, that's crazy."
<es>

@201
<en>The principal was speechless in surprise, but I was dead serious.
<es>

@202
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, it may sound crazy. But so what? Can you just think of me as your real grandson?"
<es>

@203
<en>I couldn't leave the principal by herself to wallow in her loneliness. That's not what Haruka wanted.
<es>

@206
<en>{Principal}\n"...pft."
<es>

@207
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@208
<en>What's so funny? The principal was trying to suppress her laughter.
<es>

@209
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Excuse me, principal... Can I be...your grandson...?"
<es>

@210
<en>{Principal}\n"Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself. I can see why Haruka liked you so much."
<es>

@211
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah...?"
<es>

@212
<en>But is it really that funny?
<es>

@213
<en>{Principal}\n"I wish I was ten years younger..."
<es>

@214
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ten years younger?"
<es>

@215
<en>The principal chuckled mischievously. Is she teasing me? Is this really the same principal?
<es>

@216
<en>{Principal}\n"Thank you, Haruma-kun. I really mean it. Your kindness really touches me. I'm happy just to have those sentiments."
<es>

@217
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why just the sentiments? Regardless of what you say, I will be your grandson eventually."
<es>

@220
<en>{Principal}\n"You will be?"
<es>

@223
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I haven't given up on Haruka yet."
<es>

@224
<en>{Principal}\n"What? But that's..."
<es>

@225
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So please, I want to be your apprentice!"
<es>

@226
<en>{Principal}\n"My apprentice?"
<es>

@227
<en>The principal looked surprised and confused.
<es>

@230
<en>{Principal}\n"My apprentice? Do you mean you want to become an alchemist?"
<es>

@231
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't say I wanted to become your grandson on a whim. I have decided to study alchemy for the rest of my life."
<es>

@232
<en>{Principal}\n"But..."
<es>

@233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please!"
<es>

@234
<en>I bowed deeply. The principal looked perplexed.
<es>

@235
<en>{Principal}\n"Please raise your head."
<es>

@236
<en>The principal lowered her head to look directly into my face.
<es>

@237
<en>{Principal}\n"Are you trying to take Haruka's place?"
<es>

@238
<en>She asked me with a gentle voice.
<es>

@239
<en>{Principal}\n"I know you're worried about me, but you don't have to take the entire burden on yourself, Kazushi."
<es>

@240
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, that's not the reason. I'm asking this because it's what I want to do."
<es>

@241
<en>{Principal}\n"Are you sure?"
<es>

@242
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka always said that alchemy existed to make people happy. I want to study the alchemy that Haruka loved."
<es>

@243
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will take all the classes and study as hard as possible, so please teach me alchemy."
<es>

@244
<en>I've never asked anyone to teach me something so desperately. But now, I simply want to know more about alchemy, the subject Haruka dedicated her life to.
<es>

@245
<en>The principal sighed deeply and smiled a bit.
<es>

@248
<en>{Principal}\n"In that case, I will gladly teach you."
<es>

@249
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really!?"
<es>

@252
<en>{Principal}\n"Of course. Though teaching may be a misnomer - studying together may be closer to the truth."
<es>

@253
<en>The principal gazed out and took in the carpet of flowers in full bloom.
<es>

@256
<en>{Principal}\n"For a long time, I'd forgotten how to enjoy alchemy. Yet you and Haruka have reminded me of it."
<es>

@257
<en>{Principal}\n"I studied so hard in order to catch up with my husband. I loved what I was doing and enjoyed myself very much, but I forgot about those feelings for a long time."
<es>

@260
<en>The principal looked as though she were reminiscing about the good old days. She smiled happily.
<es>

@261
<en>{Principal}\n"I know how you feel about studying alchemy. I felt the same way. I want to get those feelings back."
<es>

@262
<en>{Principal}\n"So I won't say that I'm going to be teaching you. Rather, I want to study together with you, Haruma-kun. Is that okay?"
<es>

@263
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, of course!"
<es>

@264
<en>Studying alchemy will help me understand more about Haruka. That's why I want to learn about it.
<es>

@267
<en>{Principal}\n"Since Haruka is gone, I had almost given up on finding a successor."
<es>

@268
<en>The principal squinting at the carpet of white flowers.
<es>

@269
<en>{Principal}\n"Looking on them now, I remember when I first came to this island..."
<es>

@270
<en>A wide grin spread across her face as she gazed in recollection. I felt the exact same way.
<es>

@271
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I remember when I first met Haruka."
<es>

@273
<en>It was like this, in the middle of these blooming flowers, that I met Haruka for the first time.
<es>

@274
<en>I remembered it clearly. We just stared at each other with no awareness for the passing of time. It seemed as if everything was for all eternity.
<es>

@277
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka..."
<es>

@280
<en>The Haruka of my illusions smiled.
<es>

@281
<en>{Principal}\n"I feel like everything started from here. And also, that something new will take its first step from here."
<es>

@282
<en>The principal must have seen her husband in her eyes. The flowers murmured as she smiled, and the white garden began to shine.
<es>

@285
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this...?"
<es>

@286
<en>{Principal}\n"Seibe-san, I was happy to be loved by you. Thank you."
<es>

@287
<en>The light grew stronger. At first, I thought it was another illusion, but it wasn't. The illusion of Haruka faded in the shining light.
<es>

@288
<en>Our vision was filled with the pure, glowing light.
<es>

@290
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wh-what is this?"
<es>

@291
<en>It was there, deep down inside my heart. I didn't even know these feelings were there, and I wasn't able to see or feel them before.
<es>

@292
<en>It was just like how you can't see the depths of the ocean when the water churns. That's why I never noticed before.
<es>

@294
<en>With my eyes closed, I could still see the light in the dark. The light glowed gently, and I felt a feeling of deja vu.
<es>

@295
<en>The light illuminated the inner part of my soul and my entire being. Why did it feel so nostalgic and dear?
<es>

@296
<en>Wait...
<es>

@297
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka...?"
<es>

@298
<en>Is this Haruka?\nYes, I can feel her.\nDoes this feeling lead me towards Haruka?
<es>

@299
<en>When I made love with her, I felt we were connected at a deeper level. And now I have the same feeling.
<es>

@300
<en>Is this just some kind of remnant of that feeling? Like a phantom pain you might get after having your leg amputated?
<es>

@301
<en>{Kazushi}\n"........."
<es>

@302
<en>I carefully drew in a series of tiny threads like a spider reclaiming its web. I could feel something strong on the other end.
<es>

@303
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm still connected...?"
<es>

@304
<en>I haven't lost it? We're still connected? Where?
<es>

@305
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka...are you there?"
<es>

@306
<en>I feel like I'm flying through the air.\nNo...I'm in free-fall.
<es>

@307
<en>I can sense myself falling deeper and deeper.
<es>

@314
<en>{Kazushi}\n(What? Where am I?)
<es>

@315
<en>This is the basement at school. And that horrible memory has returned.
<es>

@316
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Hmm...?)
<es>

@317
<en>I can't move. It feels like I'm lying on the cold hard ground.
<es>

@318
<en>It's dark. And I see the collapsed rocks around me.
<es>

@319
<en>{Kazushi}\n(This is...?)
<es>

@321
<en>{???}\n *sniff* *sob* *sob*
<es>

@322
<en>I can hear someone crying. Is it Haruka? No... it's the principal, but when she was younger.
<es>

@323
<en>{???}\n"Sensei...*sob*..."
<es>

@324
<en>Her sobbing dwindled down and the young principal left in tears. So who am I?
<es>

@325
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Am I her husband?)
<es>

@326
<en>This must be another dream. I'm having another nightmare about that accident.
<es>

@327
<en>I had no feeling in my legs. I must have been injured.
<es>

@328
<en>{Kazushi}\n(There is no way I can move like this.)
<es>

@329
<en>I had already grown too weak to speak. I couldn't get my body to move. But above all that, I felt a deep, bottomless fear.
<es>

@330
<en>The source of all fear is death. And it's the creeping shadow of death that's scaring me - I mean Seibe-sensei.
<es>

@332
<en>I have no idea how good of an alchemist Haruka's grandpa was, but watching death creep up for the very first time made even such a powerful alchemist as frightened as a child.
<es>

@334
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Ugh...!)
<es>

@337
<en>My eyesight was diminishing. The blurry images of my surroundings were growing harder to see.
<es>

@338
<en>I was alone. I was terrified at the fact that I was alone. The thought of dying alone was far heavier than I had imagined.
<es>

@339
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Somebody...)
<es>

@341
<en>I would scream out for help if my voice were still capable of leaving my mouth. I cried out in my mind...\nSomebody! Help me!
<es>

@345
<en>I was going mad from the fear of death. I thought I had been prepared to die, but here I was panicking.
<es>

@346
<en>While one part of me felt it all objectively and found it ridiculous, another part of me was crying in fear like a little child.
<es>

@351
<en>Finally, my sight was gone. I was enveloped in complete darkness. Death was darkness.
<es>

@352
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Somebody...Help me!!)
<es>

@353
<en>I prayed desperately.
<es>

@357
<en>Then, a dazzling light shined into my lost vision.
<es>

@358
<en>{Kazushi}\n(......!!)
<es>

@360
<en>The dazzling light burned my eyeballs, even as I shut my eyes. Amidst the light, a red dot with a yellowish tinge appeared. It shone brighter than the light and began to fill my vision.
<es>

@362
<en>{Kazushi}\n(What is this!?)
<es>

@363
<en>In no time, the red light became large enough to embrace my entire body.
<es>

@365
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What the--?"
<es>

@366
<en>I was in that flower garden. The one where Haruka and I met.
<es>

@367
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No...it is not."
<es>

@368
<en>It looked similar, but I'm not on Eiden Island.
<es>

@369
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is this place?"
<es>

@370
<en>I had no idea. The only thing I knew is that this world was born together along with that light.
<es>

@371
<en>The world that enveloped me and Seibe-sensei as it was born.
<es>

@372
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@373
<en>There was a gentleman standing before me. Since when has he been here?
<es>

@376
<en>{Seibe}\n"We meet at last."
<es>

@377
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you Seibe-san?"
<es>

@378
<en>This was the first time I'd ever met him in person, but I could recognize him because I was him in my dreams.
<es>

@379
<en>{Seibe}\n"I've been waiting for you for a long time, but I knew you would make it eventually because Haruka loved you."
<es>

@380
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You know about us?"
<es>

@381
<en>It was a total surprise that he knew about Haruka and me. I thought I was just having a one-way dream about someone from the past.
<es>

@382
<en>Seibe chuckled as he saw my reaction.
<es>

@383
<en>{Seibe}\n"I knew that long before you two did. I witnessed the fact that it was one future out of the many possibly futures awaiting you."
<es>

@384
<en>{Seibe}\n"The stone has such a power as well."
<es>

@385
<en>He smiled calmly. The stone?
<es>

@386
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm...What is this place?"
<es>

@387
<en>Am I really talking with the principal's husband who died so many years ago? Am I in my dreams again?
<es>

@388
<en>{Seibe}\n"This is the world Hisae created after my death."
<es>

@389
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Hisae?"
<es>

@390
<en>That's the principal's name. Then she created this world? I looked around...
<es>

@391
<en>{Seibe}\n"This is a world Hisae created, and that's why it resembles Eiden Island. This is a world where I, who should have died, can live on."
<es>

@392
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you?"
<es>

@393
<en>{Seibe}\n"Hisae couldn't forgive herself for not being able to save me. That's why she wished so strongly."
<es>

@394
<en>{Seibe}\n"She wished for a world in which I didn't die, and even though that was probably done subconsciously, her wish was too strong to ignore."
<es>

@395
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who couldn't ignore it?"
<es>

@396
<en>{Seibe}\n"This stone."
<es>

@397
<en>A soft light appeared in the air. It was a stone giving off a faint glow.
<es>

@398
<en>That is the stone which was buried in my dream. The stone that the principal and Seibe-san were studying.
<es>

@399
<en>It was about as big as a chicken egg, and had a smooth surface. The shell didn't look hard, though, but rather soft and elastic.
<es>

@400
<en>The surface was red with a yellowish tinge. The closer to the center, the more golden it looked. Was this really a stone?
<es>

@401
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's like the stone is alive."
<es>

@402
<en>The stone had a soothing effect as it emanated warmth. The light it gave pulsed like a heartbeat.
<es>

@403
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this the island's...?"
<es>

@404
<en>{Seibe}\n"That's right. This stone is the answer to the mystery of the island and the source of all its power. It's this stone which made Hisae's subconscious wish come true."
<es>

@405
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The principal's wish..."
<es>

@406
<en>Her wish was probably not to let Seibe-san die. It must have been so strong and intense.
<es>

@407
<en>And Seibe-san, too, wished at his very last moment that he wouldn't die. And when both of their wishes matched, this world was born.
<es>

@408
<en>This explains why I saw what I saw.
<es>

@409
<en>{Seibe}\n"I am the final vestige of Seibe's consciousness. The world Hisae created was able to take me in and provide me with a temporary life."
<es>

@410
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did that stone work because of the principal's wish?"
<es>

@411
<en>Her strong wish kept Seibe-san's consciousness from dying. Her wish created this parallel world.
<es>

@412
<en>{Seibe}\n"This world is what Hisae sees inside her mind's eye. Therefore I guess you could say that I've lived on inside of her heart."
<es>

@413
<en>For the sake of the principal's peace of mind, Seibe-san consented to live on in her heart.
<es>

@414
<en>However, he had no idea at the time that it would turn into an alternate reality.
<es>

@415
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does the principal know about this parallel world?"
<es>

@416
<en>{Seibe}\n"No, she doesn't. Her wish was fulfilled, but she never knew it. It's pretty ironic, isn't it?"
<es>

@417
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why don't we just tell her?"
<es>

@418
<en>If the two of them could be reunited again, then I'm sure Haruka would be happy. However, Seibe-san firmly shook his head.
<es>

@419
<en>{Seibe}\n"My existence is a warped one which can only exist in this world. That's why I haven't been able to tell Hisae about me."
<es>

@420
<en>Does that mean he's trapped here for good?
<es>

@421
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, it's like you're imprisoned in a cage..."
<es>

@422
<en>Seibe-san smiled gently, as if to affirm that I was right.
<es>

@423
<en>He's been stranded on this world - truly caught between life and death, unable to do either.
<es>

@424
<en>{Seibe}\n"I wouldn't mind being like this, if only I could bring peace and comfort to Hisae. But Hisae doesn't even know I'm here."
<es>

@425
<en>{Seibe}\n"However, that's almost over. This world will also end soon."
<es>

@426
<en>{Kazushi}\n"End? You mean it'll disappear? Why? What's gonna happen to you?"
<es>

@427
<en>If Seibe-san can only live in this parallel existence, then what'll happen to him when it vanishes?
<es>

@428
<en>{Seibe}\n"It is only natural that this happens."
<es>

@429
<en>Instead of answering my question, Seibe-san spoke in riddles. Or was that his answer? He wore a gentle smile, as if he had prepared himself for this long ago.
<es>

@430
<en>It may only be natural, but before that...
<es>

@431
<en>{Seibe}\n"Before that happens, I have something I must do."
<es>

@432
<en>Seibe-san and I shared the same thought. Because I've seen the past through his eyes, it probably made him feel very close to me.
<es>

@433
<en>{Seibe}\n"I want to make one last, selfish desire of mine come true. That's why I've been waiting for you."
<es>

@434
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? For me?"
<es>

@436
<en>{Seibe}\n"When this world was created, I glimpsed the stone's 'will'. All the principles founding our world are packed within the stone. By taking a glimpse at that, I was able to witness the future."
<es>

@438
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You witnessed the future... Then, you knew what was going to happen?"
<es>

@439
<en>{Seibe}\n"I knew you were coming to this island. And that you would fall from that rope bridge. That's why I saved you."
<es>

@440
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?...Rope bridge?"
<es>

@441
<en>He must be talking about when we first arrived on the island. Yeah, I fell from the bridge...\nBut that was...
<es>

@442
<en>{Kazushi}\n"............oh."
<es>

@447
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Aahhhhh.........!!"
<es>

@448
<en>I was plummeting towards the ground at an incredible speed.
<es>

@449
<en>When I looked up, I saw the rope bridge. Below lay the dense forest. And the forest was drawing closer.
<es>

@450
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I-I don't want to die...!!"
<es>

@451
<en>I don't want to die a virgin! I want a girlfriend!
<es>

@452
<en>{???}\n"Take care of Haruka."
<es>

@453
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What...?"
<es>

@457
<en>At that moment, I was engulfed in a dazzling light.
<es>

@458
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh...!!"
<es>

@459
<en>It felt like being cradled in a parent's arms.
<es>

@465
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Urgh..."
<es>

@466
<en>I found myself lying on the cold dirt. Then I got up.
<es>

@467
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where am I?"
<es>

@468
<en>I felt confused - I thought I was in my room waking up from a bad dream. However, my memories returned instantly.
<es>

@469
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's right, I fell from the bridge."
<es>

@470
<en>At that time, I hadn't thought much about it. I looked up at the rope bridge and wondered just how high up it was.
<es>

@471
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, I'm alive! I'm awesome!"
<es>

@472
<en>I thought it was a miracle that I fell from such a height without being injured. I thought I was the luckiest man alive.
<es>

@473
<en>But I guess that wasn't the case at all. I didn't miraculously survive, I was rescued.
<es>

@478
<en>{Seibe}\n"Now do you remember?"
<es>

@479
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes. But why me?"
<es>

@480
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can't you just talk to your wife like you're doing with me now?"
<es>

@481
<en>{Seibe}\n"Unfortunately, no, I can't. I can only exist on this side of the world and nowhere else."
<es>

@482
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then why me?"
<es>

@483
<en>You can talk to me and even saved my life.
<es>

@484
<en>{Seibe}\n"That's because you were about to die. In life and death situations, your soul becomes so pure that I can try to physically reach out to it."
<es>

@485
<en>{Seibe}\n"Many years ago, I tried to save one of this academy's girls, but it didn't work that time. I was unable to save her, the poor thing."
<es>

@486
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does that mean it only worked through sheer luck?"
<es>

@487
<en>{Seibe}\n"Haruma-kun, don't you remember what I told you? I knew you'd be coming to the island, so I was prepared. And now we've finally met."
<es>

@488
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you want me to do?"
<es>

@489
<en>I figured that Seibe-san needs my help, but I have no idea what he's trying to request.
<es>

@490
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I want to help you. Tell me what I can do."
<es>

@491
<en>Haruka would help her grandparents in any way possible, so this is going to be for Haruka too.
<es>

@492
<en>{Seibe}\n"Thank you. There is one thing I want you to do for me."
<es>

@493
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes. If I can."
<es>

@494
<en>{Seibe}\n"I know you can. I want you to take me out of this place."
<es>

@501
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nngh..."
<es>

@503
<en>{Principal}\n"Haruma-kun! Haruma-kun!"
<es>

@504
<en>When I woke up, I heard the principal calling to me. However, it felt far away, as if I was looking up at the sky from underneath the water.
<es>

@505
<en>{Principal}\n"Haruma-kun! Are you okay?"
<es>

@506
<en>Again, somebody shook my body. And the sun's rays, too, ran through me.
<es>

@507
<en>I felt like a strength was gathering up inside me as I lay under the warm sunlight.
<es>

@508
<en>The time has come. Something inside of me has awoken.
<es>

@509
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hisae......"
<es>

@510
<en>Seibe-san was using my body to speak to his wife.
<es>

@513
<en>{Principal}\n"Excuse me?"
<es>

@514
<en>The principal seemed a bit shocked at being called by her first name. She didn't know what was going on yet.
<es>

@515
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hisae, it's me."
<es>

@516
<en>{Principal}\n"Me?"
<es>

@517
<en>The principal tilted her head, but then her eyes were flung wide open as realized it.
<es>

@522
<en>{Principal}\n"Seibe-san......is that you?"
<es>

@528
<en>Surprise pierced her eyes as tears streamed down her face. The principal's face was flushed with joy, just like a young girl's. She travelled back in her memories to the time they first met.
<es>

@530
<en>{Principal}\n"Seibe-san, why?"
<es>

@531
<en>{Seibe}\n"Hisae...\nI've kept you waiting for too long, haven't I?"
<es>

@534
<en>{Principal}\n"You've returned?"
<es>

@535
<en>The principal clung to my body as the tears rolled down her cheeks. Seibe-san smiled softly back and slowly shook his head.
<es>

@536
<en>{Seibe}\n"No, I must go now."
<es>

@539
<en>{Principal}\n"What?"
<es>

@540
<en>The principal's smile froze.
<es>

@541
<en>{Principal}\n"Is that...so..."
<es>

@542
<en>The principal quietly accepted what he said. It was clear that she was no longer a woman driven by a single desire. She even showed him a small, loving smile.
<es>

@545
<en>{Principal}\n"Yes, this is only natural, isn't it? I understand that now."
<es>

@546
<en>Tears continued to pour down her smiling face. Seibe-san wiped them away with his finger.
<es>

@547
<en>{Seibe}\n"Yes, this is the natural way of things."
<es>

@548
<en>{Principal}\n"I will see you soon enough. I'm getting old myself - I'm a grandma now, you know."
<es>

@549
<en>{Seibe}\n"You haven't changed a bit, Hisae. You're just as beautiful as you were years ago."
<es>

@550
<en>{Principal}\n"You're embarrassing me..."
<es>

@551
<en>The principal flushed slightly.
<es>

@552
<en>{Seibe}\n"This place looks the same as before. There were so many flowers in full bloom just like this, when we first came here."
<es>

@553
<en>{Principal}\n"I remember the flowers started to bloom immediately after we stepped onto the island."
<es>

@554
<en>{Seibe}\n"Yeah. I remember that."
<es>

@555
<en>I finally got it. That's why the principal had her eye on me from the start. It was the exact same when Haruka and I first met.
<es>

@556
<en>And the principal was right. Before I knew it, I was saved by Seibe and influenced by his existence.
<es>

@557
<en>{Seibe}\n"Since then, neither you nor this place have changed at all, and my feelings for you are the same. I love you even now, just as I always have."
<es>

@560
<en>{Principal}\n"Ahh..."
<es>

@561
<en>The principal caught her breath and began crying again.
<es>

@562
<en>{Seibe}\n"I have always wanted to tell you that once again."
<es>

@563
<en>{Principal}\n"I-I-I love you just the same, too."
<es>

@564
<en>They pledged themselves to each other again in the flower garden amidst a full bloom like a young couple vowing eternal love at the wedding.
<es>

@565
<en>{Principal}\n"I swear, for all eternity..."
<es>

@568
<en>The principal reached out to me, and the two reunited lovers kissed.
<es>

@569
<en>As the white flower petals danced with each other in the breeze, the two continued to kiss for a long, long time.
<es>

@574
<en>{Seibe}\n"Now, it's time to say goodbye."
<es>

@575
<en>The statement was made with finality. The principal nodded calmly.
<es>

@576
<en>{Principal}\n"Yes. See you soon."
<es>

@577
<en>The principal fought hard to smile through her tears. She wanted to send her most beloved off with a happy face.
<es>

@581
<en>{Seibe}\n"Thank you, Haruma-kun. Thanks to you, I was able to tell my beloved I love her once more."
<es>

@582
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is the least I could do."
<es>

@583
<en>I felt Seibe-san leaving my body.
<es>

@584
<en>{Seibe}\n"Thank you, Haruma-kun. Now the world Hisae created will vanish."
<es>

@585
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see. Then you are..."
<es>

@586
<en>Seibe-san gave me a gentle smile. He would finally be able to rest in peace.
<es>

@587
<en>{Seibe}\n"I leave the rest in your hands, Haruma-kun."
<es>

@588
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? The rest?"
<es>

@589
<en>{Seibe}\n"The greater portion of the stone's power was being used to maintain that world. But now it will be free of that duty."
<es>

@590
<en>{Seibe}\n"You can do it... No, you're the only one I can ask to do it."
<es>

@591
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm, ask me to do what...?"
<es>

@592
<en>Seibe-san was fading away.
<es>

@593
<en>{Seibe}\n"Take care of Hisae...and Haruka."
<es>

@594
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Haruka?! Seibe-san, wait!"
<es>

@596
<en>Seibe-san was gone.
<es>

@597
<en>And he left the red stone in my hands.
<es>

@598
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The stone..."
<es>

@599
<en>The stone looked red from one angle and gold from another. From my side, the principal stared into the glowing rock.
<es>

@602
<en>{Principal}\n"This is what I've been looking for my entire life. The magical stone at the island's core: the treasure that is the source of this island's power."
<es>

@603
<en>This stone is also what gave birth to the world Seibe-san was in. This is source of power for this island's alchemy.
<es>

@604
<en>{Principal}\n"He's bequeathed the stone to you."
<es>

@605
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It seems like it."
<es>

@606
<en>The stone felt alive in my hands. The reddish-gold object pulsated like a beating heart.
<es>

@607
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What am I going to do with it? ...Seibe-san is relying on me."
<es>

@608
<en>{Principal}\n"He is?"
<es>

@609
<en>The world created by the principal, where Seibe-san lived, was now gone. The world created by the Principal?\n"I leave the rest in your hands"...?
<es>

@610
<en>Does that mean...
<es>

@611
<en>{Kazushi}\n"........."
<es>

@612
<en>An idea flashed through my head. I couldn't give a reason why, but I knew that was the answer.
<es>

@615
<en>{Principal}\n"What's the matter, Haruma-kun?"
<es>

@616
<en>The stone that fulfilled the principal's wish is here in my hands. So he's telling me to do the same? Can I do it too?
<es>

@617
<en>{Principal}\n"Haruma-kun?"
<es>

@618
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Principal...how did you create that world?"
<es>

@619
<en>{Principal}\n"What world?"
<es>

@620
<en>That's right. The principal didn't know about it. She'd created it subconsciously. All she did was make a wish with all her heart.
<es>

@621
<en>Which means there's no proper technique to do it. So...
<es>

@622
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe I can do it after all..."
<es>

@623
<en>I have to do it.
<es>

@624
<en>{Principal}\n"Do what? Haruma-kun, what's going on?"
<es>

@625
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We might still be able to make it."
<es>

@627
<en>Seibe-san entrusted the task to me. This has to be the task he meant.
<es>

@628
<en>But I'm not really sure if I can pull this off or not. Even so, I have to do it. I have to try and remember what Haruka taught me.
<es>

@629
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The process should be the same as alchemical refinement."
<es>

@630
<en>I know the procedures. Until just recently, I'd been shut in the lab endlessly refining away.
<es>

@631
<en>I should be pretty good at it by now.
<es>

@632
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Haruka."
<es>

@633
<en>Now I need to visualize. I need to visualize the process that will make it happen.
<es>

<en>I began to concentrate, and felt my mind growing sharper. I pictured Haruka strongly in my mind.
<es>

@636
<en>I closed my eyes and stared into the darkness. Finally, a small light began to appear.
<es>

@639
<en>It was a tiny point of light, smaller than a pinhead, but I sensed that everything would begin from there.
<es>

@640
<en>As they say, the universe began with a tiny atom exploding into everything.
<es>

@641
<en>That's it, explode! I began pouring energy into that tiny dot. I visualized all my strength, even my soul pouring into it.
<es>

@642
<en>This step was like raising the heat on the burner. Just as the water boils more quickly over a higher flame, the dot of light began to writhe.
<es>

@643
<en>It was like a living creature. The light shimmered and pulsated as it grew stronger.
<es>

@644
<en>{Kazushi}\n(More...More...)
<es>

@645
<en>I started pouring my entire self into it from head to toe. I don't care if I've got nothing left. I don't care if I burn out the flame of my life.
<es>

@646
<en>More... Power...
<es>

@651
<en>At that moment, I felt something exploding inside of me.
<es>

@656
<en>There was a bright white space. I found myself in there with nothing else. Did I fail?
<es>

@657
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka."
<es>

@658
<en>Something appeared from the empty space. The silhouette clouded in white steadily became clearer.
<es>

@661
<en>{Haruka}\n"You're amazing, Kazushi-kun."
<es>

@662
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka!!"
<es>

@663
<en>The woman I loved was right before my eyes with a gentle smile as if she were chiding a mischievous boy.
<es>

@664
<en>{Haruka}\n"You finally made it all the way here. I never knew you could be so persistent."
<es>

@665
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, they always used to say I was a poor loser. I guess we've still got plenty left to find out about each other."
<es>

@666
<en>I felt overwhelmed, talking to the one I loved, who I once thought was dead. But nothing's finished yet.
<es>

@669
<en>{Haruka}\n"I see. There's still a lot I don't know about you, Kazushi-kun, but it's too late."
<es>

@670
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, Haruka, it's not too late. I'm here to bring you back."
<es>

@671
<en>I reached out my hand to her. I will hold her hand tight and lead her back.
<es>

@674
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sorry, I can't."
<es>

@675
<en>However, Haruka wouldn't take my hand.
<es>

@676
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why not? Don't you want to come with me?"
<es>

@677
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm already dead. I know that grandpa's gone, too."
<es>

@678
<en>{Kazushi}\n"And Seibe-san told me to take care of you."
<es>

@681
<en>{Haruka}\n"Grandma's subconscious kept grandpa tied down, didn't it? Using the power of that stone."
<es>

@684
<en>{Haruka}\n"But that was a unique circumstance. Grandpa's soul was frozen and preserved right before he died."
<es>

@685
<en>{Haruka}\n"However, souls are meant to cycle onwards. It's about time for me to go too..."
<es>

@686
<en>Haruka sadly closed her eyes.
<es>

@687
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where are you going?"
<es>

@688
<en>Instinctively I felt a sudden fear:\nThe fear that Haruka might go somewhere far away from me again.
<es>

@691
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't know. There may be a place where all dead people go..."
<es>

@692
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No way..."
<es>

@693
<en>Am I really too late? I've come this far...
<es>

@696
<en>{Haruka}\n"Please don't give me that look. You're amazing - you've even created this place."
<es>

@697
<en>It's just a white space: a plain, empty room.\nHaruka looked around wistfully.
<es>

@700
<en>{Haruka}\n"They say that if you master alchemy, you can use it to create a miniature universe of your own. I think this is it. You did it, even though you're just a beginner."
<es>

@701
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I borrowed the stone's power. Even so, all I got was this white space."
<es>

@702
<en>To me, this is far from advanced. That's why, I believe, Haruka said it was too late.
<es>

@705
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's still amazing. I think you've got what it takes to be a great alchemist. And someday, you will be outstanding."
<es>

@706
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't do it all by myself. If you really think it's possible, then please, come and help me."
<es>

@709
<en>{Haruka}\n"That isn't possible.\nI'm sorry."
<es>

@710
<en>She rejected my offer, pushing me towards despair.
<es>

@711
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's time for me to go. I can feel it. I'm beginning to fade away."
<es>

@712
<en>Haruka was leaving. Fear, instead of sorrow, came over me. Haruka's face started to distort.
<es>

@715
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm sorry to make you sad. I spent years taking care of grandma, so I know how hard it is to be the one left behind."
<es>

@716
<en>Haruka twisted her face in pain, implying that it was also hard for the people leaving.
<es>

@717
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll do something, okay! So just stay with me forever..."
<es>

@718
<en>I couldn't help but moan and sob, even though I knew it would make Haruka even sadder.
<es>

@721
<en>{Haruka}\n"I want to be with you as well. I don't want to leave you, but I'm not allowed to stay..."
<es>

@722
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who cares if you're allowed to or not."
<es>

@725
<en>{Haruka}\n"What?"
<es>

@726
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't care if anyone lets us, or if it causes us to turn the entire world against us."
<es>

@727
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't care if it invokes God's wrath and he tries to strike us down with divine punishment!"
<es>

@728
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If that's all it takes for me to be together with you, then I'll take whatever he throws at me. So please, stay with me!"
<es>

@729
<en>I can no longer lift my head. With my face hanging down, it was all I could do to thrust out my hand.
<es>

@732
<en>{Haruka}\n"You really are a poor loser."
<es>

@733
<en>Haruka smiled softly and finally reached her hand over to me. Her fingers touched mine.
<es>

@734
<en>Then suddenly...
<es>

@735
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahh..."
<es>

@736
<en>Haruka's fingertips began to vanish.
<es>

@737
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka...!!"
<es>

@738
<en>Her fingers, elbows, and shoulders...\nHaruka was fading away with a smile.
<es>

@741
<en>{Haruka}\n"Thank you, Kazushi-kun. I was so touched when you said you don't care if the entire world becomes your enemy for me."
<es>

@744
<en>{Haruka}\n"But I'm sorry, it looks like I'm out of time."
<es>

@745
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No...Haruka!!"
<es>

@748
<en>{Haruka}\n"I was so happy to see you one last time, Kazushi-kun. I was so happy to have met you."
<es>

@749
<en>Haruka was fading away. The person I loved with all my heart was disappearing.
<es>

@750
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait!! Haruka!!"
<es>

@751
<en>This is exactly the same as before when I couldn't help Haruka in the fire.\nI'm losing her again...
<es>

@752
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka...!!"
<es>

@753
<en>I tried to reach my hand out as far as I could. Then I grabbed her and pulled her as tightly against me as I could.
<es>

@754
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi-kun..."
<es>

@755
<en>Haruka looked up at me in despair. I held her tight, but couldn't stop her from disappearing.
<es>

@756
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka......"
<es>

@757
<en>She smiled quietly in my arms, like she'd already accepted her destiny.
<es>

@760
<en>{Haruka}\n"If I could have just one more wish come true... then I want to be with you again in our next life too. And then, I want to become your wife."
<es>

@761
<en>{Haruka}\n"Will you take me as your bride then?"
<es>

@762
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course."
<es>

@763
<en>{Haruka}\n"Really? Thank you."
<es>

@764
<en>Haruka continued fading away. This time, she's really leaving me for good.
<es>

@765
<en>Is there nothing I can do? Nothing at all?
<es>

@766
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I also make a wish?"
<es>

@769
<en>{Haruka}\n"What?"
<es>

@770
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Will you marry me now?"
<es>

@773
<en>{Haruka}\n"What?"
<es>

@777
<en>Haruka looked perplexed, but I held her tight and kissed her budding lips.
<es>

@778
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ah, mm...mmm..."
<es>

@779
<en>With our lips together, I cleared my mind and began to concentrate.
<es>

@780
<en>What we need now is a burning flame and a flask.
<es>

@781
<en>The container is this space I created.
<es>

@782
<en>And we're the ingredients for refinement.
<es>

@783
<en>Our ingredients are the male and female principles. Two substances with opposing properties.
<es>

@784
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi...n..."
<es>

@785
<en>Our bodies felt hot together. So hot we could melt and mix together.
<es>

@786
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ka, zushi...n..."
<es>

@788
<en>Our bodies grew hotter still and we started to glow. We were two lights blending together.
<es>

@790
<en>We were now joined together by the marriage of our souls. Haruka's soul and mine were melting and blurring into one.
<es>

@791
<en>Just a little bit more...
<es>

@792
<en>A little more...
<es>

@793
<en>We can get there...
<es>

@798
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahh..............."
<es>

@800
<en>I found myself back in the garden. Haruka was...
<es>

@801
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's gone..."
<es>

@802
<en>Haruka had vanished from my arms. I thought we made it. ...Did I fail?
<es>

@805
<en>{Principal}\n"Haruma-kun!"
<es>

@806
<en>I turned around as I heard the principal calling me.
<es>

@808
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@809
<en>I saw the stone lying on the ground, but it didn't look like a stone anymore. It was opening up, as though it were about to tremble and laugh with joy.
<es>

@810
<en>{Principal}\n"This is..."
<es>

@811
<en>The principal and I stared at it. The stone began shedding layers, one by one.
<es>

@812
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this a flower?"
<es>

@815
<en>{Principal}\n"Has it been a bud this whole time, then?"
<es>

@817
<en>And it has flowered into bloom. It's full of life and glowing.
<es>

@818
<en>{Principal}\n"Is this what the stone really looks like? Is this the one that can grant eternal life and revive the dead?"
<es>

@819
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, with this, Haruka can--?"
<es>

@820
<en>{Principal}\n"That's right! That's right! Bring Haruka's body here now!"
<es>

@824
<en>Haruka lied amongst the flowers, her body restored by alchemy.
<es>

@825
<en>She looked as though she were sleeping, but there was nothing inside the shell.
<es>

@826
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's time to wake you up, Haruka."
<es>

@827
<en>There was one, single flower shining brighter that all the white flowers in the garden. It had bright, glowing golden petals. A gold so pure it was nearly white.
<es>

@828
<en>Under the natural light, that golden flower glistened as if were moist. Well, actually it was. Inside the bowl of its open petals rested a pool of water.
<es>

@829
<en>{Principal}\n"Give that water to Haruka."
<es>

@830
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, ma'am."
<es>

@831
<en>I hesitated briefly, then I uprooted the flower and poured the water into my mouth.
<es>

@832
<en>{Kazushi}\n"........."
<es>

@833
<en>I kissed Haruka as she lay still, leading the water from my mouth to hers as if I were breathing life into her.
<es>

@837
<en>*Twitch*
<es>

@838
<en>Haruka's eyebrows flickered slightly.
<es>

@839
<en>{Principal}\n"Haruka...?"
<es>

@840
<en>While the principal gasped, Haruka's skin began to turn pink and her face started to flush.
<es>

@841
<en>Her long eyebrows twitched again.\nAnd then...
<es>

@843
<en>{Haruka}\n"Nnn......"
<es>

@844
<en>A nostalgic voice came from those rosy lips - the voice I never thought I'd hear again.
<es>

@845
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka... Haruka..."
<es>

@846
<en>I called her name. Her eyebrows and eyelids began moving rapidly, and her eyes shot open.
<es>

@851
<en>{Haruka}\n"...Hmm? Kazushi-kun?"
<es>

@852
<en>Haruka looked up at me with a vacant look. I missed this look so much.
<es>

@853
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka......"
<es>

@854
<en>I've been waiting for this moment. Now that my love is right here, I hugged her tightly to my chest with both arms.
<es>

@855
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi-kun...\nIt hurts..."
<es>

@856
<en>She complained with a sweet, loving voice, but I refused to loosen my arms from around her.
<es>

@857
<en>{Haruka}\n"I mean it. It hurts."
<es>

@858
<en>Then Haruka returned the embrace with one just as tight as mine.
<es>

@859
<en>{Haruka}\n"It feels like I've been living in a dream."
<es>

@860
<en>Haruka muttered, blinking her sleepy eyes.
<es>

@861
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka, you have been asleep for a long, long time."
<es>

@862
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh. I guess I overslept, huh?"
<es>

@863
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Overslept isn't the half of it."
<es>

@864
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@865
<en>I continued holding her in a tight embrace. At the same time, I buried my face into her hair and deeply inhaled her sweet scent.
<es>

@867
<en>{Haruka}\n"Did you miss me?"
<es>

@868
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes. I missed you so much that I thought I would die."
<es>

@869
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sorry. I'll never make you sad again."
<es>

@870
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not gonna let you go away from me anymore."
<es>

@871
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm not going away any more."
<es>

@873
<en>The sun rose over the horizon and shined down upon us, lighting up the garden. It was the dawn of a new day.
<es>

@874
<en>Bathed in the morning sunlight, Haruka and I kissed each other, vowing that we would never spend another day apart.
<es>
