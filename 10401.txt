@11
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How is he?"
<es>

@16
<en>{Rin}\n"He's asleep. Is he just lying down with his eyes closed?"
<es>

@23
<en>{Ran}\n"He's not going to go after her or anything like that, right?"
<es>

@26
<en>{Rin}\n"What? I hope not..."
<es>

@32
<en>{Daigo}\n"He ate. So he should be fine."
<es>

@37
<en>{Pierre}\n"He is going to be just fine. Especially, after all the cries."
<es>

@42
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Yeah, but he finally accepted Haruka's death just today. The real pain may start from now."
<es>

@47
<en>{Appo-}\n"He'll be okay. We are here for him."
<es>

@52
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'll be watching him just in case."
<es>

@55
<en>I hear everything they're talking about. I know they are peeking in here too.
<es>

@56
<en>But it feels good. Just knowing everyone is there for me. And the fact everyone cares about me. It all makes me feel at ease.
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka..."
<es>

@58
<en>I cried like an idiot. Somehow I feel better, but at the same time, I feel depressed again.
<es>

@59
<en>Because I now have to accept that Haruka is not really here any more.
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"... ... .... ...."
<es>

@61
<en>In Haruka's bed, there is still a bit of her scent left. I can smell it, but probably not everyone does.
<es>

@62
<en>And this scent will go away eventually.
<es>

@63
<en>I haven't got much sleep lately. So it won't be so difficult for me to fall asleep with my eyes closed. But, for some reason, I can't sleep at all.
<es>

@64
<en>I'm afraid of sleeping. If I sleep, I'll have to wake up to the world that Haruka is not around.
<es>

@65
<en>That will put me in despair. So I'd rather not wake up, which scares me even more.
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka..."
<es>

@67
<en>I call her name.
<es>

@70
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahh, Haruka..."
<es>

@72
<en>Haruka is gone. So is her illusion that my crazy mind created.
<es>

@73
<en>But this is how the world should be. The world Haruka is not around.
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Aren't you ever gonna come back to me, Haruka?"
<es>

@75
<en>I feel like falling down into a world of despair again. Into a deep, bottomless hole. I'm so scared.
<es>

@76
<en>But I am not, because my friends are all here for me.
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka..."
<es>

@79
<en>That night, I fell into a deep sleep. And I had a dream.
<es>

@85
<en>{Haruka}\n"Are you gonna go right after graduation?"
<es>

@86
<en>I'm not sure what she is asking?
<es>

@87
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Going where?"
<es>

@88
<en>{Haruka}\n"A foreign country. You want to go, right?"
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh..."
<es>

@90
<en>We promised each other that we would get out of this island and go to some place far abroad together.
<es>

@91
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We will make some money first. And we'll get a driver's license, and..."
<es>

@92
<en>Come to think of it, it will take a lot of preparation. But I feel things are becoming more realistic since I met Haruka.
<es>

@93
<en>But, in fact, I'm not really facing the reality. I don't even know what else needs to be prepared.
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It looks like it is going to take time."
<es>

@97
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yeah, we will need a lot of money. But we can make it, if you and I can work together."
<es>

@98
<en>Haruka looks very excited. We just talked about the harsh reality, didn't we?
<es>

@99
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You look so happy, Haruka?"
<es>

@102
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yes, I am. Because now I have a goal to achieve. No, it's more of a dream."
<es>

@103
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Dream? Sounds like you've never had one before."
<es>

@104
<en>{Haruka}\n"Actually, no. I have never had one."
<es>

@105
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? What about becoming an alchemist, like the principal?"
<es>

@106
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's not my dream. That is more like another reality to me because I feel it will come about eventually as long as I study everyday. So to me, it's a pursuit of reality, not dream."
<es>

@107
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah?"
<es>

@110
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh, yes. And..."
<es>

@111
<en>Suddenly, Haruka's voice becomes thin.
<es>

@114
<en>{Haruka}\n"In my whole life, instead of wishing how things were done, it was more of how everything had to be done certain way including my grandma's situation..."
<es>

@117
<en>{Haruka}\n"Then I met you, Kazushi. My life has changed because I now have my own dream. I'm so happy everyday."
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Me too."
<es>

@119
<en>I had never felt this way until I met Haruka. I'm happy everyday, too.
<es>

@120
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm happy today and tomorrow too. Because our everyday will lead to our "some day"."
<es>

@123
<en>{Haruka}\n"Thanks to you, Kazushi. You know what? You have become my dream."
<es>

@124
<en>Her shining eyes look straight at me. What beautiful, bright eyes they are!
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are embarrassing me."
<es>

@128
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oops. Sorry. I'm embarrassed too."
<es>

@129
<en>Both of us blush. The breeze from the sea pats us on the cheeks.
<es>

@132
<en>{Haruka}\n"Let's go some day. You and me. Promise?"
<es>

@133
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure. Promise. I will take you there, no matter what."
<es>

@134
<en>{Haruka}\n"Thank you."
<es>

@135
<en>Holding hands together, we watch the ocean for a long time, while imagining the world beyond the horizon.
<es>

@143
<en>I woke up with Haruka's sweet scent.
<es>

@144
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It was a dream.."
<es>

@145
<en>In the dream, we were very happy together. It was just a month ago. But now, things are completely different.
<es>

@146
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Promise..."
<es>

@147
<en>The promise that I made - - taking her out of this island, visiting my home town and traveling together.
<es>

@148
<en>Haruka was looking forward to all that. I broke my promise.
<es>

@149
<en>Can I really not make my promise come true? What is gonna happen to me?
<es>

@154
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So beautiful."
<es>

@155
<en>It looks like a pure white carpet. All the flowers, against all odds, are in full bloom, just like when I first met Haruka.
<es>

@156
<en>{Principal}\n"This is so amazing."
<es>

@157
<en>I hear someone's softly exclaiming voice.
<es>

@160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Principal."
<es>

@161
<en>It was the principal. She walks through the followers to come toward me.
<es>

@162
<en>{Principal}\n"They are very special flowers. It's not easy to get them bloom like this. But your friends did it."
<es>

@163
<en>Haruka also said these white followers are very special.
<es>

@164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They are all incredible guys."
<es>

@165
<en>They protected Haruka's flowers while I was wandering around in the darkness. And they pulled me out of it.
<es>

@166
<en>I have so much respect for them.
<es>

@169
<en>{Principal}\n"By seeing these flowers, I can tell how much they love you and Haruka."
<es>

@170
<en>{Principal}\n"Haruka was a very lucky girl to have friends like them."
<es>

@171
<en>The principal says regrettably. I guess because she only notices it now. She quietly stares at the flowers.
<es>

@174
<en>{Principal}\n"I should have paid more attention to her. My eyes were completely clouded."
<es>

@175
<en>The principal chuckles a bit. I know she is blaming herself.
<es>

@176
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please don't blame yourself."
<es>

@177
<en>I know how the principal feels. I would have taken on the same path as hers, if I were alone.
<es>

@178
<en>However, my friends were for me. And for the principal, Haruka was there.
<es>

@179
<en>But Haruka is now gone.
<es>

@182
<en>{Principal}\n"I'm okay. I just feel I have become completely alone."
<es>

@183
<en>The principal softly smiles. I never knew she smiles like that. My heart aches to see such a gentle smile on her face.
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But you have a son, right?"
<es>

@185
<en>Her son - - Haruka's father. He must have come to the funeral. But I didn't get to see him since I missed the ceremony.
<es>

@188
<en>{Principal}\n"With this tragedy, I have lost contact with him completely. He's never liked alchemy. Maybe, he hates it now."
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry to hear that..."
<es>

@190
<en>Haruka came to this school because she wanted to study alchemy. But I guess the tragedy ruined everything.
<es>

@191
<en>{Principal}\n"Everyone in my family leaves me. Maybe, this is a punishment."
<es>

@192
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, please don't say that."
<es>

@193
<en>{Principal}\n"Well, being alone is not as bad as I think. Plus, I have got no one left in my family."
<es>

@194
<en>Her eyes tell the principal has given up on something. Haruka would not like to see her grandma like this. I cannot leave her alone.
<es>

@195
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, I will become your grandson!"
<es>

@198
<en>{Principal}\n"What? You..my grandson?"
<es>

@199
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? I was planning to be anyway. I was very serious with Haruka."
<es>

@200
<en>{Principal}\n"That's crazy, Kazushi."
<es>

@201
<en>The principal seems to be in dumb surprise. But I'm dead serious.
<es>

@202
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, it may sound crazy. But so what? Can you just think of me as your real grandson?"
<es>

@203
<en>I cannot leave the principal alone to make her feels lonely. This is not what Haruka wants.
<es>

@206
<en>{Principal}\n"She stifles a laugh."
<es>

@207
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@208
<en>What's so funny? The principal suppresses her laughter.
<es>

@209
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Excuse me, principal...Can I be...your grandson...?"
<es>

@210
<en>{Principal}\n"Oh, sorry. I couldn't help. I know why Haruka liked you."
<es>

@211
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah...?"
<es>

@212
<en>But, is that funny?
<es>

@213
<en>{Principal}\n"I wish I were ten years younger."
<es>

@214
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ten years younger?"
<es>

@215
<en>The principal chuckles mischievously. Is she teasing me? Is this the same principal?
<es>

@216
<en>{Principal}\n"Thank you, Kazushi. I really mean it. Your kindness really touches me. And I appreciate your offer."
<es>

@217
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What does that mean? I will become your grandson eventually."
<es>

@220
<en>{Principal}\n"Eventually?"
<es>

@223
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I have not yet given up on Haruka."
<es>

@224
<en>{Principal}\n"What? But that's..."
<es>

@225
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I want to be your student!"
<es>

@226
<en>{Principal}\n"My student?"
<es>

@227
<en>The principal looks surprised and confused.
<es>

@230
<en>{Principal}\n"My student? Do you mean you want to be an alchemist?"
<es>

@231
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't say I wanted to become your grandson on a whim. I have decided to study alchemy for the rest of my life."
<es>

@232
<en>{Principal}\n"But..."
<es>

@233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please. Please say yes!"
<es>

@234
<en>I bow deeply. The principal looks perplexed.
<es>

@235
<en>{Principal}\n"Get your head up."
<es>

@236
<en>The principal puts her head down to look into my face.
<es>

@237
<en>{Principal}\n"Are you trying to take Haruka's place?"
<es>

@238
<en>She asks me with a gentle voice.
<es>

@239
<en>{Principal}\n"I know you are worried about me. But you don't have to take all the burdens for yourself, Kazushi."
<es>

@240
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, that's not the reason. I'm asking just because I want to."
<es>

@241
<en>{Principal}\n"Are you sure?"
<es>

@242
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka always said alchemy is for the happiness of people. So I want to study it as much as Haruka did."
<es>

@243
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will take the classes and study as hard as I can so,please teach me alchemy."
<es>

@244
<en>I've never asked anyone to teach me anything this desperately. I simply want to know more about alchemy - - something that Haruka put her mind to.
<es>

@245
<en>The principal sighed deeply. And she smiles a bit.
<es>

@248
<en>{Principal}\n"Sure, I will teach you."
<es>

@249
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really!?"
<es>

@252
<en>{Principal}\n"Of course. Teaching may be the right word. Learning together may be the word."
<es>

@253
<en>The principal looks far out and glances at the carpets of full boom.
<es>

@256
<en>{Principal}\n"When it comes to learning alchemy, I have forgotten one important condition all these years. You have to love it and enjoy doing it. You and Haruka reminded me of that."
<es>

@257
<en>{Principal}\n"I studied hard so that I could catch up with my husband. I loved it and enjoyed myself very much. But those feelings have long gone."
<es>

@260
<en>The principal looks as if she were picturing her good old days. She smiles happily.
<es>

@261
<en>{Principal}\n"I know how you feel about studying alchemy. I felt the same way. I want to get those feelings back."
<es>

@262
<en>{Principal}\n"I won't say I will teach you. Rather, I want to study with you, Kazushi. Is that okay?"
<es>

@263
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, of course!"
<es>

@264
<en>Studying alchemy will help me understand more about Haruka. That's why I want to learn about it.
<es>

@267
<en>{Principal}\n"Since Haruka was gone, I've almost given up on my successor."
<es>

@268
<en>The principal squinting at the carpet of white flowers.
<es>

@269
<en>{Principal}\n"I remember when I first came to this island."
<es>

@270
<en>A smile breaks out on her face.
<es>

@271
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But, is that funny?"
<es>

@273
<en>It was in the place like this with a lot of flowers around that I met Haruka for the first time.
<es>

@274
<en>I clearly remember it. We just looked at each other with no consciousness of time. It seemed everything was for all eternity.
<es>

@277
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka..."
<es>

@280
<en>My illusion -- Haruka smiles.
<es>

@281
<en>{Principal}\n"Everything started here. And it seems something new begins here."
<es>

@282
<en>The principal may see her husband in her eyes. As she smiles, the flowers murmur. And the white garden begins to shine.
<es>

@285
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this...?"
<es>

@286
<en>{Principal}\n"Honey, you loved me so much. I am so grateful. Thank you."
<es>

@287
<en>Light becomes stronger. First, I thought it was an optical illusion, but it is not. Inside the gleaming garden, Haruka is fading away.
<es>

@288
<en>Our sight is filled with the light.
<es>

@290
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wh-What is this?"
<es>

@291
<en>It was there, deep down in my life. I didn't even know it was there. I was not able to see it.
<es>

@292
<en>When the surface of water runs high, its bottom can't be seen. The same principle can apply to my life. I have not been able to see the deep down in my life.
<es>

@294
<en>With my eyes closed, I can still see light in the dark. The light gently glows. And I get a reminiscent feeling.
<es>

@295
<en>The light illuminates the inter part of my life and whole being. How come I get such a wistful feeling?
<es>

@296
<en>Wait...
<es>

@297
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka...?"
<es>

@298
<en>Haruka? Yes, I can feel her. Does this feeling lead to Haruka?
<es>

@299
<en>When I made love with her, I felt we were connected at the deep level. And now I have the same feeling.
<es>

@300
<en>Is this some kind of remnant of that feeling? Just like a hallucinated pain you might get from a removed organ of your body?
<es>

@301
<en>{Kazushi}\n"... ... ..."
<es>

@302
<en>I carefully draw in spider web-like tiny threads. I can feel something strongly.
<es>

@303
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm still connected...?"
<es>

@304
<en>It's not the remnant. Am I still connected? If so, where to?
<es>

@305
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka..are you there?"
<es>

@306
<en>I feel like being up in air. No, I'm falling down.
<es>

@307
<en>My sense is falling down deeper and deeper.
<es>

@314
<en>{Kazushi}\n(What? Where am I)
<es>

@315
<en>This is the basement at school. The horrible memory comes back.
<es>

@316
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Hmm...?)
<es>

@317
<en>I can't move. It seems I am lying on the cold ground.
<es>

@318
<en>It's dark. And I see the collapsed rocks around me.
<es>

@319
<en>{Kazushi}\n(This is...?)
<es>

@321
<en>{???}\n"Ugh....Ugh.....Ugh..."
<es>

@322
<en>I can hear someone sobbing. Is it Haruka? No, it's the principal, but she is young.
<es>

@323
<en>{???}\n"Uhhh....Uhhh..."
<es>

@324
<en>Her sobbing dwindles down. The young principal goes away. So who am I?
<es>

@325
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Am I her husband?)
<es>

@326
<en>This must be another dream. I'm having a bad dream - - about that accident.
<es>

@327
<en>I have no feeling in my legs. I must have been injured.
<es>

@328
<en>{Kazushi}\n(There is no way I can move like this.)
<es>

@329
<en>I have no strength to move or speak. As my body get weaker, I tremble with incredible fear.
<es>

@330
<en>The source of fear is death. And it's the shadow of death that scares me, I mean Mr.Seibe.
<es>

@332
<en>I have no idea how good Mr.Seibe as an alchemist. But I can feel how scared he was with imminent death. He is frightened like a child.
<es>

@334
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Ugh....!)
<es>

@337
<en>My sight is getting weak. I'm definitely losing sight here.
<es>

@338
<en>I am being alone, which terrifies me. The fact I am dying alone is extremely frightening.
<es>

@339
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Somebody....)
<es>

@341
<en>I would scream out for help, if I could let out my voice. Somebody, help! -- I cry out in my mind.
<es>

@345
<en>I thought I was ready to die but obviously I'm not. Because I feel like loosing my mind before I die.
<es>

@346
<en>Objectively I know that's nonsense, but simultaneously I'm crying out of fear like a child. And those mixed feelings exist within me.
<es>

@351
<en>Finally, my sight is gone. I am in complete darkness. It is the death of darkness.
<es>

@352
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Somebody...Help me!!)
<es>

@353
<en>I pray desperately.
<es>

@357
<en>Then, some bright light comes into my sight.
<es>

@358
<en>{Kazushi}\n(... ...Huh!!)
<es>

@360
<en>I can still see the light with my eyes closed. And there is a red point shining inside the light, which grows bigger and bigger.
<es>

@362
<en>{Kazushi}\n(What is this!?)
<es>

@363
<en>In no time, the red light becomes large enough to embrace my whole body.
<es>

@365
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@366
<en>Is that the flower garden at school? The place I met Haruka for the first time.
<es>

@367
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No...it is not."
<es>

@368
<en>It looks similar, but I'm not in Eiden Island.
<es>

@369
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is this place?"

@370
<en>I've got no clue. But the one thing for sure - - the red light came from this side of world.
<es>

@371
<en>The world that wrapped me and Mr.Seibe in.
<es>

@372
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@373
<en>Since when? There is a man standing before me.
<es>

@376
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Finally, we have met each other."
<es>

@377
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you Mr.Seibe?"
<es>

@378
<en>This is the first time I've ever met him in person. But I can recognize him because I was always him in my dream.
<es>

@379
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I've been waiting for you for long. But I knew you would make it because Haruka loved you."
<es>

@380
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you know about us?"
<es>

@381
<en>It was a total surprise that he knew about Haruka and me. I thought he just showed up in my dream.
<es>

@382
<en>Looking at my reaction, Mr.Seibe chuckles.
<es>

@383
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I had already known about you guys before you even knew it. I could see it as the possibility in the future."
<es>

@384
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"That stone also has such power."
<es>

@385
<en>He smiles calmly. That stone?
<es>

@386
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah...What is this place?"
<es>

@387
<en>I am talking with the principal's husband who died years ago. Am I in my dream again?
<es>

@388
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"This is the world Hisae created."
<es>

@389
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hisae?"
<es>

@390
<en>It's the principal's name. The world she created? I look around.
<es>

@391
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"This is Hisae's world. That's why it all looks like Eiden Island. This is the world I can still be alive, although I'm technically dead."
<es>

@392
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you?"
<es>

@393
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Hisae couldn't forgive herself for the fact she couldn't save me. That's why she wished strongly."
<es>

@394
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"For the world that I don't die. She must have done it unconsciously. And her wish was strong enough to make that thing work."
<es>

@395
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Make what thing work?"
<es>

@396
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"This stone."
<es>

@397
<en>A soft light appears in air. It is a stone that gives a faint glow.
<es>

@398
<en>That is the stone that came in my dream. This is the stone the principal and Mr.Seibe were studying.
<es>

@399
<en>It looks as big as a chicken egg, and also has the smooth surface. The shell doesn't look hard, rather soft and elastic.
<es>

@400
<en>The surface is yellowish red in color. Its center looks gold. Is this a real stone?
<es>

@401
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It appears this stone is alive."
<es>

@402
<en>This stone has some sort of grace with warmth. And it lights up and down like heart beating.
<es>

@403
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this stone from this island?"
<es>

@404
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"That's right. This stone is the mystery of this island - -the source of the power. This stone made Hisae's wish come true."
<es>

@405
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The principal's wish..."
<es>

@406
<en>The wish that Mr.Seibe doesn't die. Her wish must have been so strong and intense.
<es>

@407
<en>And Mr.Seibe, too, made his wish at the very last moment that he would not die. And the moment both of their wishes matched, this world was born.
<es>

@408
<en>This explains why I saw what I saw.
<es>

@409
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I am the last consciousness of Seibe. The world Hisae created was able to take me in and allows me to live a temporary life."
<es>

@410
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Did that stone work because of the principal's wish?"
<es>

@411
<en>Her strong wish kept Mr.Seibe's consciousness from being dead. Then her wish created this side of world.
<es>

@412
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"This world is what Hisae sees inside her visionary mind. Therefore, I can say I've lived in her heart."
<es>

@413
<en>For the sake of principal's peace of mind Mr.Seibe admonished to live in her heart.
<es>

@414
<en>However, at that time he had no idea that would literally become a reality.
<es>

@415
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does the principal know about this side of world?"
<es>

@416
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"No, she doesn't. Her wish was fulfilled, but she never knew it. It's pretty ironic, isn't it?"
<es>

@417
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why don't we just tell her?"
<es>

@418
<en>Why not they just see each other again? I'm sure Haruka will be happy. However, Mr.Seibe shakes his head.
<es>

@419
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I can only live in this side of world. That's why I haven't been able to tell my wife about me."
<es>

@420
<en>Does it mean he cannot leave here for good?
<es>

@421
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So you are like being locked in a cage."
<es>

@422
<en>Mr.Seibe gently smiles, hitting I am half correct.
<es>

@423
<en>He has been stranded in this side of world. He is neither dead nor alive.
<es>

@424
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I wouldn't mind being here only if I could bring peace and comfort for Hisae. But she doesn't know I am here."
<es>

@425
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"This side of world will end soon."
<es>

@426
<en>{Kazushi}\n"End? What do you mean? Why? What is gonna happen to you?"
<es>

@427
<en>Mr.Seibe can only live on in this side of world. If this place is gone, what will happen to him?
<es>

@428
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"This world is not supposed to exist, to begin with."
<es>

@429
<en>He smiles suggestively, to avoid an answer to my questions. Or is that his answer?
<es>

@430
<en>He may be right, but...before that happens...
<es>

@431
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Before that happens, I have something I must do."
<es>

@432
<en>Mr.Seibe thinks of the same thing as me. Probably I have been seeing the past from his eyes, which make me feel very close to him.
<es>

@433
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I want to make one last, selfish desire of mine come true. That's why I've been waiting for you."
<es>

@434
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it? Waiting for me?"
<es>

@436
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"The moment this world gets born, I saw the "intention"of this stone. This stone has all the rules and principles of the world. When I saw it, I was able to see the future."
<es>

@438
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You saw the future...Do you mean you knew what was gonna happen?"
<es>

@439
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I knew you were coming to this island. And it was me that helped you when you fell from the bridge.
<es>

@440
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?....Bridge?"
<es>

@441
<en>He must be talking about when I first arrived at this island. Yes, I fell from the bridge. But that was....
<es>

@442
<en>{Kazushi}\n"............Uh"
<es>

@447
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Aahhhhh.........!!"
<es>

@448
<en>I am falling down at incredible speed.
<es>

@449
<en>I see the bridge up there, and see the woods down there. And the woods get closer and closer.
<es>

@450
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't want to die....!!"
<es>

@451
<en>I am still fucking virgin! I don't want to die! I want a girlfriend!!
<es>

@452
<en>{???}\n"Take care of Haruka."
<es>

@453
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What...?"
<es>

@457
<en>At that moment, a dazzling light wraps me in.
<es>

@458
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh...!!"
<es>

@459
<en>It feels like someone embraces me tenderly.
<es>

@465
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I moan softly."
<es>

@466
<en>I find myself lying down on the cold dirt. Then, I get up.
<es>

@467
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where am I?"
<es>

@468
<en>I feel confused. I thought I was in my room. However, my memory comes right back.
<es>

@469
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I fell... I fell from the bridge."
<es>

@470
<en>I look up. How high is that bridge up there?
<es>

@471
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait...I am alive!! I'm fuckin' alive!! Amazing!!"
<es>

@472
<en>I thought it was a miracle I got no injury after I fell from that height. I thought I was the luckiest man in the world.
<es>

@473
<en>But, now I know that's not that case. It's not like I was lucky or anything. I was saved.
<es>

@478
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"You remember now?"
<es>

@479
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes. But why me?"
<es>

@480
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can't you really talk to your wife like you are doing with me now?"
<es>

@481
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Unfortunately, no. I can't. I can only live in this side of world, no other places."
<es>

@482
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then, why with me?"
<es>

@483
<en>You talk to me, and saved my life.
<es>

@484
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"That's because you were about to die. At the life-death situations, your soul becomes so pure that I can even reach."
<es>

@485
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"A few years ago, I tried to save a girl. But it didn't work at that time. I felt so bad."
<es>

@486
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does that mean I was simply lucky because it worked?"
<es>

@487
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Kazushi, I knew you'd be here. So I was prepared. And now we meet."
<es>

@488
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you want me to do?"
<es>

@489
<en>I figure that Mr.Seibe needs my help. But I have no idea what it is.
<es>

@490
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I want to help you. Tell me what I can do."
<es>

@491
<en>Haruka would help her grandparents in any way possible. So this is going to be for Haruka too.
<es>

@492
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Thank you. There is one thing I want you to do for me."
<es>

@493
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes. If I can."
<es>

@494
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I know you can. I want you to take me out of this place."
<es>

@501
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I moan softly."
<es>

@503
<en>{Principal}\n"Kazushi! Kazushi!"
<es>

@504
<en>When I woke up, I heard the principal calling me. But her voice feels like echoed far away upon the sky.
<es>

@505
<en>{Principal}\n"Kazushi! Are you okay?"
<es>

@506
<en>Again, someone shakes my body. And the sun's rays, too, runs through me.
<es>

@507
<en>Under the warm sunlight, I feel like gaining strength inside me.
<es>

@508
<en>Time has come. Something within me just woke up.
<es>

@509
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hisae... ...."
<es>

@510
<en>He uses my body to speak to his wife.
<es>

@513
<en>{Principal}\n"Excuse me?"
<es>

@514
<en>Being called her first name, the principal seems shocked a bit. She doesn't know what is going on.
<es>

@515
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hisae, it's me."
<es>

@516
<en>{Principal}\n"Me?"
<es>

@517
<en>The principal inclines her head. But then, she opens her eyes wide.
<es>

@522
<en>{Principal}\n"Is it you, Seibe? Is it really you?"
<es>

@528
<en>From her surprised eyes, tears run down on her face. Her face is flushed with joy, just like a young girl. She travels back to the time they first met.
<es>

@530
<en>{Principal}\n"Seibe, why?"
<es>

@531
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Hisae. I've kept you waiting long, haven't I?"
<es>

@534
<en>{Principal}\n"You are back?"
<es>

@535
<en>As tears roll down her cheeks, the principal clings to my body. Mr.Seibe in me softly smiles back and slowly shakes his heads.
<es>

@536
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"No, I must go now."
<es>

@539
<en>{Principal}\n"What?"
<es>

@540
<en>The principal shows a shock on her look.
<es>

@541
<en>{Principal}\n"I...understand...."
<es>

@542
<en>The principal quietly accepts what he said. It's clear that she is no longer the person obsessive about one idea. She even shows him a smile.
<es>

@545
<en>{Principal}\n"This is the way it is. Right? I know it now."
<es>

@546
<en>Tears run down on her smiling face.
<es>

@547
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"That's right. This is the way it is."
<es>

@548
<en>{Principal}\n"I will see you soon. I'm getting old myself. I am a grandma, you know."
<es>

@549
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"You have not changed a bit, Hisae. You are still beautiful."
<es>

@550
<en>{Principal}\n"You embarrass me..."
<es>

@551
<en>The principal flushes slightly.
<es>

@552
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"This place looks the same as before. There were so many flowers in full bloom just like this, when we first came here."
<es>

@553
<en>{Principal}\n"I remember the flowers started to bloom immediately after we stepped onto the island."
<es>

@554
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Yeah. I remember that."
<es>

@555
<en>I finally get it. Haruka and I had the same situation as theirs when we first met. That's why the principal had an eye on me from the outset.
<es>

@556
<en>And the principal was right. Before I knew it, I was saved by Mr.Seibe and influenced by his existence.
<es>

@557
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Since then neither you nor this place have changed at all. Same as my feeling towards you. I love you, I always have. I love you. I always have."
<es>

@560
<en>{Principal}\n"Ahh..."
<es>

@561
<en>The principal catches her breath, and sheds tears again.
<es>

@562
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I always wanted to tell you that."
<es>

@563
<en>{Principal}\n"I love you too."
<es>

@564
<en>They pledge themselves to each other in the full bloom flower garden like a young couple vowing eternal love at the wedding.
<es>

@565
<en>{Principal}\n"I swear..."
<es>

@568
<en>The principal stretches herself to me. And they kiss each other.
<es>

@569
<en>As flowers fly in the breeze, they kiss each other for a long time.
<es>

@574
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Time to say goodbye."
<es>

@575
<en>Mr.Seibe says decidedly.
<es>

@576
<en>{Principal}\n"Yes. See you soon."
<es>

@577
<en>The principal smiles with teary eyes. She just wants to send him off with a smile.
<es>

@581
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Thank you, Kazushi. Thanks to you, I was able to tell her I love her once more."
<es>

@582
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is the least I could do."
<es>

@583
<en>I feel that Mr.Seibe is leaving my body.
<es>

@584
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Thank you, Kazushi. This side of world is dying now."
<es>

@585
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see. Then you are..."
<es>

@586
<en>Mr.Seibe gives me a gentle smile. Finally, he is able to rest.
<es>

@587
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Take care of the rest, Kazushi."
<es>

@588
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? The rest?"
<es>

@589
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"That stone was mainly used to keep that side of world. But not anymore."
<es>

@590
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"You can do it....No, only you can do it."
<es>

@591
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah...What do you want me to take care of?"
<es>

@592
<en>Mr.Seibe is melting away.
<es>

@593
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Take care of Hisae....and Haruka."
<es>

@594
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Haruka? Wait, Mr.Seibe!"
<es>

@596
<en>Mr.Seibe is gone.
<es>

@597
<en>And leaving the stone alone.
<es>

@598
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This stone..."
<es>

@599
<en>This stone looks red from one side, and looked gold from another. Being by my side, the principal stares into the stone.
<es>

@602
<en>{Principal}\n"This is what I have been looking for. The magic stone that has been in this island. The treasure that is the source of everything."
<es>

@603
<en>And this stone also helped create the world Mr.Seibe lived in. The stone is the source of power that alchemy has in this island.
<es>

@604
<en>{Principal}\n"He has left you with that..."
<es>

@605
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It seems like it."
<es>

@606
<en>The stone looks alive. The reddish, gold object pulsates like a heart beating.
<es>

@607
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What am I going to do with it? Mr.Seibe told me to take care of it."
<es>

@608
<en>{Principal}\n"He said that?"
<es>

@609
<en>The world the principal created is now gone. She created it? I take care of it?
<es>

@610
<en>Does it mean?
<es>

@611
<en>{Kazushi}\n"... .... ..."
<es>

@612
<en>Some idea occurs in my mind. And I know that is the answer.
<es>

@615
<en>{Principal}\n"Kazushi, what's the matter?"
<es>

@616
<en>This stone fulfilled the principal's wish. Did he want me to try the same? Can I do that?
<es>

@617
<en>{Principal}\n"Kazushi?"
<es>

@618
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Principal, how did you create the other side of world?"
<es>

@619
<en>{Principal}\n"The other side of world?"
<es>

@620
<en>Oh, that's right. The principal didn't know that she created that world with no intention. All she did was to make a strong wish.
<es>

@621
<en>Which means there is no certain way to do it then. So...
<es>

@622
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe, I can do it."
<es>

@623
<en>I got to do it.
<es>

@624
<en>{Principal}\n"Can you do what? What's going on, Kazushi?"
<es>

@625
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We can still make it."
<es>

@627
<en>Mr.Seibe told me to take care of it. Now I know what he meant.
<es>

@628
<en>But I'm not sure if I can really do it. But I have to do it. I try to remember what Haruka said.
<es>

@629
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The process should be the same as refinement."
<es>

@630
<en>I know how to refine. This is what I have been doing in the lab.
<es>

@631
<en>I am pretty good at this now.
<es>

@632
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka..."
<es>

@633
<en>Now I must visualize the process.
<es>

@634
<en>Now that I concentrate, it feels like my whole psyche gathers. I picture Haruka's face.
<es>

@636
<en>I close my eyes and stare at the dark. A small light appears in the darkness.
<es>

@639
<en>It's a tiny light - - as small as the point of a needle. I sense everything will start with it.
<es>

@640
<en>I heard the universe began with a little, tiny dot, which later exploded.
<es>

@641
<en>Explode? That's right. I must put all my energy into that dot. I focus my whole being and spirit on it.
<es>

@642
<en>This is a simple theory, just like intensifying fire. Higher the flame, faster things boil. I must give more energy to it.
<es>

@643
<en>The light looks like a living thing. As it shimmers with pulse, it grows bigger.
<es>

@644
<en>{Kazushi}\n(More.....More.....)
<es>

@645
<en>I pour all my energy from the bottom of my life to it. I don't care if I get nothing left in me. I don't care if I burn all of my life.
<es>

@646
<en>More... power...
<es>

@651
<en>At that moment, something bursts inside of me.
<es>

@656
<en>It is white space. I find myself in there - -nothing else. Did I screw up?
<es>

@657
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka"
<es>

@658
<en>Out of the space, something appears. It's becoming clearer and clearer.
<es>

@661
<en>{Haruka}\n"You did it, Kazushi."
<es>

@662
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka!!"

@663

<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I am stubborn, you know. I guess I have to tell you more about me."
<es>

@666
<en>I feel overwhelmed by talking to a person who once I thought was dead. But nothing begins yet.
<es>

@669
<en>{Haruka}\n"I see. I still don't know a lot of things about you, Kazushi. But it's too late."
<es>

@670
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, it's not too late, Haruka. I am here to bring you back."
<es>

@671
<en>I reach my hand over to her. I will hold her hand tight and take her home with me.
<es>

@674
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sorry, I can't."
<es>

@675
<en>However, Haruka won't take my hand.
<es>

@676
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why? Don't you want to come with me?"
<es>

@677
<en>{Haruka}\n"I am already dead. I know grandpa is gone."
<es>

@678
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Your grandpa asked me to take care of you."
<es>

@681
<en>{Haruka}\n"Grandma's unconsciousness kept grandpa connected. And that stone made it all possible."
<es>

@684
<en>{Haruka}\n"It was under special circumstances. Grandpa's soul got frozen right before his death."
<es>

@685
<en>{Haruka}\n"But, soul should be in flux. That's the way it should be. I must go too."
<es>

@686
<en>Haruka sadly closes her eyes.
<es>

@687
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where are you going?"
<es>

@688
<en>Instinctively, I feel sudden fear. The fear Haruka might have to go far from me again.
<es>

@691
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't know. There may be the place all dead people go to."
<es>

@692
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No way..."
<es>

@693
<en>Is everything too late? I've come this far.
<es>

@696
<en>{Haruka}\n"Please don't give me that look. You are amazing. You've even created this place."
<es>

@697
<en>It is just white space -- very simple room. Haruka looks around wistfully.
<es>

@700
<en>{Haruka}\n"They say if you study alchemy thoroughly, you will be able to create a small universe. I think this is it. You did it, even though you just started to study it."
<es>

@701
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I used the power of the stone. Nonetheless, this is all I got -- white space."
<es>

@702
<en>To me, this is far from being perfect. That's why, I believe, Haruka said "it's too late".
<es>

@705
<en>{Haruka}\n"No, you did great. I think you have what it takes to be an alchemist. You will become an outstanding alchemist."
<es>

@706
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I cannot do it all by myself. And if you really think so, help me."
<es>

@709
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's not possible. Sorry."
<es>

@710
<en>She rejects my idea, which pushes me to despair.
<es>

@711
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's time for me to go. I can feel it. I'm beginning to fade away."
<es>

@712
<en>Haruka is going. Fear, instead of sorrow comes over me. Haruka's face starts to distort.
<es>

@715
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm sorry to make you sad. I have taken care of grandma, so I know how hard it is being left alone."
<es>

@716
<en>Haruka twists her face with a pain, implying that it's also hard for people going away.
<es>

@717
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I have to help you! Please stay with me..."
<es>

@718
<en>I can't help but to moan and sob, although I know this will make Haruka even sadder.
<es>

@721
<en>{Haruka}\n"I also want to be with you. I don't want to go, but it's not allowed."
<es>

@722
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nothing stops us!"
<es>

@725
<en>{Haruka}\n"What?"
<es>

@726
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Nothing stops us from being together. I don't care even if I have to make an enemy of the whole world."
<es>

@727
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't care even if God makes mad at me and gives me punishment."
<es>

@728
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will be happy to be punished if I can be with you. Please stay with me."
<es>

@729
<en>I can no longer get my head up. With my head down, I just reach my hand over.
<es>

@732
<en>{Haruka}\n"You're right. You are so stubborn."
<es>

@733
<en>Haruka softly smiles and reaches her hand over to me. Her finger touches mine.
<es>

@734
<en>But like rain in the soil...
<es>

@735
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahh..."
<es>

@736
<en>Haruka's fingers are disappearing.
<es>

@737
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka...!!"
<es>

@738
<en>Her fingers, elbow, and shoulders....Haruka is fading away with a smile.
<es>

@741
<en>{Haruka}\n"Thank you. I was so touched when you said you don't care even if you make an enemy of the whole world."
<es>

@744
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sorry, but I really have to go."
<es>

@745
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No....Haruka!!"
<es>

@748
<en>{Haruka}\n"I was so happy to see you, Kazushi. I am so happy..."
<es>

@749
<en>Haruka fades away. The person I deeply love is disappearing.
<es>

@750
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait!! Haruka!!"
<es>

@751
<en>This is exactly the same as before. I could not help Haruka in flames. I'm losing her again.
<es>

@752
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka...!!"
<es>

@753
<en>I try to reach my hand over as far as I can. Then I grabbed and pressed her against me.
<es>

@754
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@755
<en>Haruka sadly looks up at me. I hold her tight, but cannot stop her from disappearing.
<es>

@756
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka......"
<es>

@757
<en>In my arms, Haruka quietly smiles. It seems she already accepts her destiny.
<es>

@760
<en>{Haruka}\n"If I can make a wish now....I want to be with you in my next life too. Also I want to be your wife, Kazushi."
<es>

@761
<en>{Haruka}\n"Can I be your wife?"
<es>

@762
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course."
<es>

@763
<en>{Haruka}\n"Really? Thank you."
<es>

@764
<en>Haruka is fading away. This time she is really leaving me.
<es>

@765
<en>Nothing I can't do? Really nothing?
<es>

@766
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I also make a wish?"
<es>

@769
<en>{Haruka}\n"What?"
<es>

@770
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Will you marry me now?"
<es>

@773
<en>{Haruka}\n"What?"
<es>

@777
<en>Haruka looks perplexed, but I hold her tight and kiss her.
<es>

@778
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ahh...Hmm..."
<es>

@779
<en>While kissing her, I concentrate with my mind clear.
<es>

@780
<en>What we need now is the fireplace and a flask.
<es>

@781
<en>The container is this space I created.
<es>

@782
<en>And the materials for refinement.
<es>

@783
<en>The materials are male principle and female principle - - two opposite substances.
<es>

@784
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@785
<en>Our bodies feel hot. We are so hot that we melt away into one.
<es>

@786
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@788
<en>Our bodies are getting hotter and we start to glow. Two lights blend into one light.
<es>

@790
<en>We are now uniting into one by marriage of our souls. Haruka's soul and my soul are melting into one.
<es>

@791
<en>Just a little bit more...
<es>

@792
<en>Little more...
<es>

@793
<en>We can get there...
<es>

@798
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahh....... .... ...."
<es>

@800
<en>I find myself back in the garden. Haruka...
<es>

@801
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She is not here..."
<es>

@802
<en>Haruka is gone. I thought we made it. Did I fail?
<es>

@805
<en>{Principal}\n"Kazushi!"
<es>

@806
<en>As I hear the principal call me I turn around.
<es>

@808
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@809
<en>I find that stone. But it doesn't look like a stone any more. It's opening itself up as if it were to tremble with joy.
<es>

@810
<en>{Principal}\n"What is this thing?"
<es>

@811
<en>The principal and I stare at it. This thing takes off its sheet one by one.
<es>

@812
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this a flower?"
<es>

@815
<en>{Principal}\n"Was that a bud then?"
<es>

@817
<en>And it has come into flower. It shows full of life.
<es>

@818
<en>{Principal}\n"Is this what the stone really looks like? Is this the one that can gives eternal life and revive the dead?"
<es>

@819
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can we bring Haruka back to life with this?"
<es>

@820
<en>{Principal}\n"That's right! That's right! Bring Haruka here now!"
<es>

@824
<en>Haruka lies in the flowers. Her body is restored by alchemy.
<es>

@825
<en>But there is nothing inside her.
<es>

@826
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm gonna wake you up now, Haruka."
<es>

@827
<en>There is one shining flower in the white flower garden. This flower has its petals sparkling in subdued gold.
<es>

@828
<en>Being exposed to natural light, the golden flower shines with moisture. There is water inside the petals, which open like a bowl.
<es>

@829
<en>{Principal}\n"Give that water to her."
<es>

@830
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes."
<es>

@831
<en>I pull the flower up by its root and pour the water in my mouth.
<es>

@832
<en>{Kazushi}\n"... ... ..."
<es>

@833
<en>I kiss Haruka lying still in death to feed the water with my whole heart.
<es>

@837
<en>She twitches a bit.
<es>

@838
<en>Haruka's eyebrows flicker slightly.
<es>

@839
<en>{Principal}\n"Haruka...?"
<es>

@840
<en>While the principal catches her breath, Haruka's skin begins to grow pinkish and her face start to flush.
<es>

@841
<en>Her long eyebrows twitch again.
<es>

@843
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hmm......"
<es>

@844
<en>Her lips start to move. A small voice comes out - - the voice I once thought I'd never ever be able to hear.
<es>

@845
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka... Haruka..."
<es>

@846
<en>I call her name. Her eyebrows and her eyelids move even more. Then her eyes open.
<es>

@851
<en>{Haruka}\n"...Hmm? Kazushi?"
<es>

@852
<en>Haruka looks up at me with a vacant look. I missed this look so much.
<es>

@853
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka......"
<es>

@854
<en>I've been waiting for this moment. Now that my love is right there, I hold her tightly with both arms.
<es>

@855
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi. It hurts..."
<es>

@856
<en>She complains with a sweet voice. However, I never loosen my arms around her.
<es>

@857
<en>{Haruka}\n"I mean it. It hurts."
<es>

@858

<es>

@863
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah...overslept."
<es>

@864
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@865
<en>I hold her in a tight embrace. At the sametime I buried my face into her hair and inhale her sweat scent deeply.
<es>

@867
<en>{Haruka}\n"Did you miss me?"
<es>

@868
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes. I missed you so much that I thought I would die."

@869
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sorry. I will never make you sad."

@871
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm not going away any more."
