<es>

@8
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is this where you wanted to come?"
<es>

@9
<en>I t was unexpected. I thought she would wanted to go to the down town or the beach.
<es>

@13
<en>{Haruka}\n"This is my most memorable place for me in this island."
<es>

@14
<en>She sits down as she tells me that with a smile.\nI sat down next to her.
<es>

@15
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see......"
<es>

@16
<en>My voice turned over.\nI wouldn't blame myself.\nWe are having a date.
<es>

@17
<en>Oh no, I can feel I'm getting nervous.
<es>

@18
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Calm down......calm down......"
<es>

@19
<en>This may be a good time to remember what Pierre said.
<es>

@25
<en>{Pierre}\n"Girls' hearts live in between their legs.\nYou need to be patient to get there."
<es>

@28
<en>{Pierre}\n"Girls' hearts live in between their legs!!\nYou whisper in their ears saying "I wanna touch your heart"and sneak in your hands between their legs."
<es>

@32
<en>Thank you Pierre.
<es>

@33
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wanna touch your heart!"
<es>

@34
<en>I sneak in my hand between Haruka's legs.
<es>

@37
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kya!?"
<es>

@41
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ouch!!"
<es>

@42
<en>Before my hand reached the goal,\nshe gave me a good counter punch.
<es>

@45
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sorry!!\nMy body reacted to a danger......"
<es>

@46
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. I'm sorry, too."
<es>

@47
<en>I knew it was not a good idea.\nI should be patient.
<es>

@50
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh, you perhaps thought about having a wrestling match for fun?"
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Umm......"
<es>

@52
<en>I think it's better leave it that way.
<es>

@55
<en>{Haruka}\n"I knew it will be boring just to talk.\nShould we go fishing or hunting?"
<es>

@56
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, it doesn't have to be that wild."
<es>

@59
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yeah?\nI still don't know much about boys and it worries me."
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?\nYou seem to know about us already."
<es>

@61
<en>I feel she's with us right from the beginning.
<es>

@64
<en>{Haruka}\n"Tell me about your family."
<es>

@65
<en>Her eyes got delighted.\nThere is not much in my family she should get delighted of.
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My family is a very ordinary one.\nWe live in a small house.\nMy grand pa built it."
<es>

@69
<en>{Haruka}\n"You have a grand pa?"
<es>

@70
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, he died when I was little."
<es>

@71
<en>{Haruka}\n"I see.\nHow about your parents?"
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If my memory is correct, I have a little sister."
<es>

@73
<en>{Haruka}\n"So, there are 4 in your family.\nIt sounds fun."
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How about your family?"
<es>

@75
<en>I know her grand ma is our principal, but I have't heard about the rest of the family.
<es>

@76
<en>{Haruka}\n"Right now, I live just with my grand ma.\nMy parents are in Tokyo."
<es>

@77
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, they are.\nI didn't know that."
<es>

@78
<en>I didn't know that.\nShe never talked about her parents before.
<es>

@79
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's because of my dad's buisiness.\nI stayed here, because I wanted to."
<es>

@80
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is your dad also an alchemist?"
<es>

@81
<en>It was only natural to think that way.\nHaruka shook her head smiling.
<es>

@84
<en>{Haruka}\n"My dad is an ordinary salary-man.\nMy mom is a house wife. They got nothing to do with alchemy."
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that right?"
<es>

@86
<en>I thought her whole family was alchemist. It wasn't the case.
<es>

@87
<en>Not like long time ago, I guess alchemists has freedom of choosing occupations nowdays.
<es>

@90
<en>{Haruka}\n"My father and my grand ma didn't get along. My father thought alchemy is old and shady."
<es>

@91
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know some people would think that way."
<es>

@92
<en>That may actually be the popular opinion regarding alchemy.\nI was one of them, too.
<es>

@95
<en>{Haruka}\n"Though my father actually took pharmaceutical major and works as a pharmacist.\nTo me, they are very similar."
<es>

@96
<en>Her smile somewhat seemed sad.\nMaybe she was inbetween her father and her grand ma.\nShe chose to stay here......
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But you stayed here and decided to pursuit the way of alchemy."
<es>

@98
<en>That's why she's here away from her parents.
<es>

@101
<en>{Haruka}\n"My grand ma's always been my idol."
<es>

@102
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Principal?"
<es>

@103
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yep."
<es>

@104
<en>She turned herself around from the white flowers.\nThey are beautiful like snow crystals.\nHaruka's still looking and cherishing at them.
<es>

@107
<en>{Haruka}\n"I believe I told you about this before.\nMy grand parents met in this island."
<es>

@108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sure you did.\nAnd this place is their memorable place."
<es>

@109
<en>We once destructed this flower bed.\nThis is where Haruka's grand pa proposed the principal.
<es>

@112
<en>{Haruka}\n"Though he passed away long time ago and I don't know much about him, they are my ideal couple."
<es>

@113
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Even if you don't know much about him?"
<es>

@114
<en>{Haruka}\n"My grnad ma has always told me about him growing up.\nWhenever she talks about him, she becomes really happy and beautiful."
<es>

@117
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's why I'm convinced that they had such a beautiful time together. I've always dreamed of having a romance like theirs."
<es>

@118
<en>She talks about it as if she's in her dream.\nIt makes me smile imagining the principal in her young era.
<es>

@119
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's why you stayed here."
<es>

@122
<en>{Haruka}\n"That, too.\nI wanted to help my grand ma.\nBut ......I don't know anymore."
<es>

@123
<en>Haruka became quiet.\nShe weeds grasses off the ground and throw them in the air.
<es>

@124
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Were you arguing with the principal earlier?"
<es>

@125
<en>I tried to say it as if it wasn't a big deal as much as possible.\nHaruka doesn't answer.
<es>

@126
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's only natural to argue with your family sometimes. I always argue with my parents. I still fight with my little sister."
<es>

@127
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's little different from fighting."
<es>

@128
<en>Haruka inserts her words inbetween mine.\nShe looked sorried a little bit.
<es>

@129
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How is it different from fighting?"
<es>

@130
<en>{Haruka}\n"Well......if it's a fight, you can always make up later on. This time, I don't think it will happen."
<es>

@131
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is it that serious?"
<es>

@134
<en>Haruka nods her head with a serious face.
<es>

@135
<en>{Haruka}\n"I can't agree to her way.\nI don't believe in sacrificing in order to achieve something."
<es>

@136
<en>{Haruka}\n"Espedcially when it means a lot to me......"
<es>

@137
<en>She's squeezing her fist tightly.\nShe must be angry at the principal.
<es>

@138
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What exactly did she do?"
<es>

@139
<en>It's hard to imagine her doing something Haruka gets so angry.\nAnd for what?
<es>

@142
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi."
<es>

@143
<en>Haruka holds my hands. She holds my hands tightly and looks straight into my eyes. I've never seen her this desperate of something.
<es>

@144
<en>{Haruka}\n"Alchemy is not evil in any means.\nIf we use it correctly, it will help us.\nIt's how we use it."
<es>

@145
<en>{Haruka}\n"I want you to know that no matter what."
<es>

@146
<en>Her words sounded as if they were preyers.\nThey came into my body and spreaded out to every edge of my body.
<es>

@147
<en>{Haruka}\n"Please......"
<es>

@148
<en>Her big eyes are about to suck me in.\nThey seem to be able to take me to a different world.
<es>

@149
<en>She didn't have to ask me in this way. My answer to her is already decided.
<es>

@150
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I trust you."
<es>

@153
<en>{Haruka}\n"You do?\nI'm so glad!"
<es>

@154
<en>She seemed so relieved she couldn't help romping like a child. It made me happy that my little word can make her so happy.
<es>

@157
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh hey!\nWhat do you want to do most right now?"
<es>

@158
<en>She looks into me with her eyes all delighted.\nHer face was so close it made me shy.
<es>

@159
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well......"
<es>

@160
<en>I wasn't prepared to answer that question.\nI looked up in the sky having difficulty to answer, I saw white clouds swimming.
<es>

@161
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I might want to fly in the sky."
<es>

@162
<en>Haruka looks up in the sky following my eyes.
<es>

@164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wish I can fly like those clouds in the sky. I've actually always dreamed of flying ever since I was a child. I even got hurt one time jumping off from a tree trying to fly."
<es>

@166
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sky......\nI like that!"
<es>

@168
<en>Haruka jumps up to stand.\nAnd she pulled me up.
<es>

@171
<en>{Haruka}\n"Let's go!"
<es>

@172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Go where?"
<es>

@173
<en>{Haruka}\n"To the sky!!"
<es>

@174
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......!?"
<es>

@179
<en>Haruka took me to the lab instead of the sky.
<es>

@182
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ummm......"
<es>

@183
<en>Haruka is staring at a furnace.
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are we doing here?"
<es>

@187
<en>{Haruka}\n"I will make you fly!"
<es>

@188
<en>She says it so easily.
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How can you do that?"
<es>

@192
<en>{Haruka}\n"Nothing is impossible for alchemy.\nIf we use noble man's stone, we can fly."
<es>

@193
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Noble man's stone......"
<es>

@195
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ofcourse we can't make that, but we don't need to have something so strong now. We just have to add little more power to an object which is already capable of flying."
<es>

@197
<en>{Haruka}\n"For an instance......bird's wings."
<es>

@198
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wings......?"
<es>

@202
<en>On both of my arms, there are wings made from bird's wings stiffen with wax.
<es>

@203
<en>I wonder what these are. And there is a huge cliff in front of me.
<es>

@204
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Am I flying off from here?"
<es>

@207
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's right!"
<es>

@208
<en>She gives me a big smile.\nWhen we just got to this island, there was still water here, not anymore.
<es>

@209
<en>I looked down. If I fail, I will die......
<es>

@210
<en>My knees are shaking from fear.
<es>

@211
<en>{Haruka}\n"Don't worry.\nWe add power to those wings with alchemy.\nYou can fly like a bird now!"
<es>

@212
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure about this?"
<es>

@215
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm positive.\nHere, watch."
<es>

@216
<en>She poured some kind of liquid she just made at the lab onto the wings.
<es>

@222
<en>Wings shined for a second.\nJust for a split of a second.
<es>

@223
<en>{Haruka}\n"You can fly now."
<es>

@224
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait a minute.\nI just think it was kind of weak."
<es>

@225
<en>I've witnessed alchemy a few times after moving to this island. I may not have enough experience to be able to tell though.
<es>

@226
<en>But as far as I know, that seemed still weak to me.
<es>

@227
<en>{Haruka}\n"That was fine.\nI went through an ordinary routine."
<es>

@228
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?\nbut......"
<es>

@231
<en>{Haruka}\n"Are you that worried?\nDo you want me to fly first?"
<es>

@232
<en>She confidently took away the wings from my arms and walked closer to the cliff.
<es>

@233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait!\nLet me go first!"
<es>

@236
<en>I took back the wings from Haruka.\nKnowing her, she might let go the wings before she flys.
<es>

@237
<en>I also have a bad feeling about this.
<es>

@240
<en>{Haruka}\n"Sure, go ahead.\nI knew you couldn't wait!"
<es>

@241
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure this thing will make us fly?"
<es>

@244
<en>{Haruka}\n"Absolutely.\nMy alchemy is not the same with my grand ma's.\nmy alchemy is to make people happy."
<es>

@245
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right.\nI got it."
<es>

@247
<en>I will trust her.\nI made sure my grip and stepped closer to the cliff.
<es>

@248
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh my......"
<es>

@249
<en>It's so high, making me dizzy.
<es>

@252
<en>{Haruka}\n"Don't ever let go the wings. Rest is easy, just let the wind take you."
<es>

@253
<en>{Kazushi}\n"O,O,O, ......K......"
<es>

@255
<en>I wonder sky divings and bungee jumps feel this way?\nIf I don't commit, I'm never gonna be able to fly.
<es>

@256
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right, here I go!!"
<es>

@257
<en>I had to scream to make up my mind.
<es>

@258
<en>(Wind blowing)
<es>

@260
<en>Right at that moment, a wind blew.
<es>

@261
<en>{Haruka}\n"Right now!"
<es>

@262
<en>Her voice pushed my back.\nI felt my body leaning forward in slow motion.
<es>

@263
<en>(Kazushi's body floats)
<es>

@264
<en>That's when my body floated.
<es>

@270
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Kazushi screaming)
<es>

@271
<en>It's the feeling of falling.\nFalling......yep, I'm falling.
<es>

@272
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Isn't this falling?\nI think this is falling!!"
<es>

@273
<en>Haruka is already way above. I didn't know who I was screaming at, but I was screaming loud. The surface of the oceam is getting closer.
<es>

@274
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi!?\nFly!!"
<es>

@276
<en>I thought I heard Haruka's voice from way up above.\nNo matter how hard I swang, wings didn't help me to fly.
<es>

@277
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Spirit!?\nIs it spirit what's missing now?"
<es>

@278
<en>(Kazushi screams to show spirit)
<es>

@283
<en>I screamed as loud as I could to put more spirit. But the falling speed stays the same. The surface of the ocean is getting closer to me with fierce speed.
<es>

@284
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think I will make it--------!!"
<es>

@285
<en>I'm falling!!\nI'm dying!!
<es>

@291
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What......!?"
<es>

@292
<en>My vision is all shiny now actually, it was my body what was shining.
<es>

@293
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's going on?"
<es>

@294
<en>I don't what went on, but I can tell the speed of me falling is now a lot slower.\nBut the surface of the ocean is just right there......
<es>

@297
<en>(Kazushi falls into an ocean)
<es>

@298
<en>I fell into the ocean.
<es>

@299
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi!?!!!"
<es>

@306
<en>(Somebody tapping Kazushi's face)
<es>

@307
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......!?"
<es>

@309
<en>(Somebody tapping Kazushi's face)
<es>

@310
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......Where am I?"
<es>

@312
<en>I woke up feeling somebody is tapping my cheeks.\nI feel something soft underneath my head.\nOh yeah, Haruka must have saved me.
<es>

@315
<en>{Natsume}\n"Oh, you are up."
<es>

@316
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who are you......?"
<es>

@317
<en>The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was Natume's face zoomed up.
<es>

@318
<en>{Kazushi}\n"N, Natsume!"
<es>

@322
<en>I jumped up.\nIt was Natume's knee pillow what felt so soft underneath my head.
<es>

@323
<en>And I was soaking wet.\nMy head to my shoes.
<es>

@324
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You saved me?"
<es>

@327
<en>{Natsume}\n"If you did crash into the ocean which you almost did, even you would not have survived."
<es>

@328
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ofcourse.\nThanks for saving me."
<es>

@331
<en>{Natsume}\n"Don't thanks me, instead,\nbe my servent."
<es>

@332
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You want me to become your servent!?\nWell, I kinda already am."
<es>

@333
<en>She's always been bossy anyways.
<es>

@336
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm not joking.\nYou should stay close to me."
<es>

@337
<en>Her tone was serious.
<es>

@338
<en>Her eyes are telling me she's serious. Besides, I've never heard her telling a joke.
<es>

@339
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You said I should stay close to you?"
<es>

@342
<en>{Natsume}\n"I won't let you face a danger like that."
<es>

@343
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume......?"
<es>

@344
<en>She looked a little different today.\nI don't know what to respond to her.
<es>

@352
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi!!"
<es>

@353
<en>Haruka ran down the stairs in a hurry.\nShe is out of breath and her knees are shaking.
<es>

@356
<en>{Natsume}\n"You suck at alchemy."
<es>

@357
<en>Natsume speaked out for me.\nHaruka looked up surprisingly to see Natsume here.
<es>

@360
<en>{Haruka}\n"Natsume......why are you here?"
<es>

@361
<en>{Natsume}\n"You suck.\nYou almost killed him."
<es>

@362
<en>Natsume blamed Haruka again.\nHaruka's face is turning red.
<es>

@365
<en>{Haruka}\n"......it was not supposed to happen......\nI did it right......"
<es>

@366
<en>{Natsume}\n"But you failed.\nKazushi, you all right?"
<es>

@369
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh......are you all right!?"
<es>

@372
<en>{Natsume}\n"Too late."
<es>

@375
<en>{Haruka}\n"......sorry......"
<es>

@376
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shut up.\nKazushi, go to the nurse's office."
<es>

@377
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes.\nBut I'm all right.\nIt's you who saved me, right Natsume?"
<es>

@378
<en>Just when I thought I would crash into the ocean, I felt something was protecting me. I didn't feel anything.
<es>

@382
<en>{Natsume}\n"You are all wet.\nYou need to change."
<es>

@383
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah, I should."
<es>

@384
<en>Natsume's little hand helped me stand up.
<es>

@388
<en>{Haruka}\n".................."
<es>

@389
<en>Haruka stays down on the floor and doesn't move at all.
<es>

@390
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka, let's go."
<es>

@391
<en>{Haruka}\n"......I'm so sorry."
<es>

@392
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry any more.\nI'm all right as you see. Everybody make mistakes."
<es>

@393
<en>{Haruka}\n"But......"

<es>

@431
<en>{Mei}\n"Anyway, I'm glad you are O.K\nwhat happened anyways?"
<es>

@432
<en>{Pierre}\n"I know.\nIt's hard to believe Haruka failed in alchemy."
<es>

@433
<en>Haruka explained to everyone what we tried to do.\nShe sounded she's feeling responsibility for what happened.
<es>

@437
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm surprised to hear you made a mistake, too.\nMoreover, it doesn't sound like it's something you would do."

<es>

@446
<en>{Haruka}\n"......sorry."

@447
<en>Sorry"is the only word Haruka is saying all day.\nAnd there is one person who's been watching her extra critically.
<es>

@454
<en>{Principal}\n"You are so responsible for this."
<es>

@455
<en>It's principal.\nShe is watching Haruka critically as if she is not Haruka's own grand ma.
<es>

@456
<en>{Principal}\n"Alchemy is supposed to be used for enriching people's life. Look what happened when you used it for your curiosity."
<es>

@461
<en>{Haruka}\n"......I already understood!!"
<es>

@462
<en>Haruka looked up and stared at Principal.\nTheir eyes meet and fought desperately.
<es>

@463
<en>{Principal}\n"If you really did know, then how could something like this happen?"
<es>

@466
<en>{Haruka}\n"......I feel sorry for Kazushi, but I did it right like how I usually do.\nThe accident shouldn't have happened......"
<es>

@467

<es>

@470

<es>

@474
<en>{Haruka}\n"Did you do this......?\nDid you play cheap tricks on me......?!!"
<es>

@475
<en>Haruka started to say something awful.
<es>

@476
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't tell me......"
<es>

@480
<en>{Mei}\n"Ofcourse not.\nPrincipal would never do such a terrible thing."
<es>

@481

<es>

@485
<en>{Haruka}\n"Umm......"
<es>

@486
<en>Haruka mumbles.\nIt must have something to do with what Haruka and Principal were talking earlier today.
<es>

@490
<en>{Principal}\n"You are such a problem child.\nWhat makes you think I do such an evil thing.\nWhat for?"
<es>

@493
<en>{Haruka}\n"I can't think of any other reason to fail like that!"
<es>

@494
<en>Principal couldn't help sighing depressingly.
<es>

@497
<en>{Principal}\n"I don't know what to say to you anymore.\nAll you do is to blame others and can't even reflect on yourself."

@503
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hisae didn't do anything."

@505

<es>

@509
<en>{Haruka}\n"But......but......"
<es>

@510
<en>Haruka couldn't say anymore.\nThat's how convinced Natsume sounded.
<es>

@515

<es>

@518
<en>{Haruka}\n"......you are lying!!"

@539

<es>

@540
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But hey, as you see, I'm all right. Why don't we put this behind us."
<es>

@543
<en>{Haruka}\n"I still don't get it.\nI went through a proper routine. Something like that should've never happened......"
<es>

@548
<en>{Principal}\n"You still don't get it, do you?"
<es>

@549
<en>Principal sounds rather sadly this time.
<es>

@552
<en>{Principal}\n"You tried it just to look back at me.\nHow can you achieve the result with such a twisted motive?"
<es>

@553
<en>{Haruka}\n"I did it to......"
<es>

@554
<en>Principal was probably right.\nHaruka could only be quiet and chagrined.\nNatsume adds some more damage to Haruka.
<es>

@558
<en>{Natsume}\n"I agree.\nYou were using Kazushi as a tool to look back at Hisae."
<es>

@561
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's not true!"
<es>

@564
<en>{Natsume}\n"You were not doing that for Kazushi.\nYou just wanted to show you are right.\nAnd that put Kazushi in a danger."

@567
<en>{Haruka}\n"I didn't mean to......"
<es>

@568
<en>It was obvious Haruka was getting cornered.

@571

@572
<en>Not only the Principal, Natsume is also blaming Haruka. Everyone else is not even understanding what's going on.
<es>

@573
<en>I'm the only one who can speak for Haruka.
<es>

@574
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If I asked her something else, like I wanted to be full or something, I would never had to be in a danger in the first place."

@578
<en>{Natsume}\n"You are foolishly nice.\nYou almost got yourself killed."
<es>

@579

<es>

@580

<es>

@605
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm all right in the end."

@606
<en>{Appo-}\n"Have you seen her afterwards?\nWe didn't see her at the dinner."

@620
<en>He gave me a serious face.\nI was hoping he was just fooling around with me, but I guess not.
<es>

@621
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yep, I do like her a lot."
<es>

@622
<en>And I told him the truth.\nI don't know since when I start liking her a lot.\nMaybe since the first day I met her.
<es>

@623
<en>I love Haruka.\nMy heart start hurting as I realized my feelings for her.
<es>

@624

<es>

@627

@628
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How can you not like Haruka?\nShe is kind to everybody. She needs to be more indepenent but it kinda makes her cute......"
<es>

@629
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She has good figure. Good voice.\nMy type has always been someone like her.\nDon't you think?"
<es>

@630
<en>When I count all the things I like about her, I realized she's perfect. Makes me wonder what took me so long to fall in love with her.
<es>

@633
<en>{Appo-}\n"When you fall for someone, it's only natural to think that way.\nI can't believe how I used to not like Hu-sen."
<es>

@636
<en>{Appo-}\n"You can't find such a pretty girl like Hu-sen any where in the world."

@637

@638
<en>I couldn't laugh at what he said.\nLove can change your entire world.

@643
<en>He threw me something.\nIt's a box.
<es>

@644
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, this is......!!"
<es>

@645
<en>{Appo-}\n"Why are you surprised?\nIt's a condom.\nYou need it."
<es>

@646
<en>It was indeed a condom.
<es>

@649
<en>{Appo-}\n"That one is super thin.\nLike you forget it's on you.\nCome back as a man!"
<es>

@650
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......it's too early for this.\nI haven't even told her my feelings. We haven't promised anything yet......"

@651
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Even if she agrees to go out with me, we should start from holding hands and then a kiss......"
<es>

@652

@653

<es>

@656
<en>{Appo-}\n"See. You can't stop once you start running.\nJust hold on to it.\nYou never know when you gonna need one."

@662
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You think so?\nSeriously?"
<es>

@663
<en>{Appo-}\n"I do. That's why I'm telling to go see her.\nShow her the condom and just say "I want you". This always works."

@664
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It does?\nThat sounds like what a maniac will do."

@671

<es>

@672

@677

@678
<en>I can't affort to make that mistake.\nA mistake of a few inches will ruin our first time.
<es>

@679

@680
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Front hole, back hole......\nNot the front one, not the back one, either......"

@683

<es>

@684

<es>

@690
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm......"
<es>

@691
<en>Her innocent way of asking made me feel even more ashamed to tell the truth.
<es>

@692
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not something I should tell to a pure person like you."
<es>

@695
<en>{Rin}\n"I'm not pure or anything."
<es>

@696
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, you are.\nBy the way, is Haruka here?"
<es>

@697
<en>I changed the subject in a hurry.\nIf Rin still insists to know what I was saying, it would make me wanna bite my tongue.
<es>

@700
<en>{Rin}\n"You came to see Haruka?\nDo you want me to go het her?"
<es>

@701
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That will be great.\nThanks."
<es>

@704
<en>{Rin}\n"Sure.\nShould I tell her you are here for something about the back hole?"
<es>

@705
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't have to tell her why I'm here for."
<es>

@710

<es>

@713
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@714
<en>I wonder what she is experimenting now.\nShe must be trying to find out what went wrong today.
<es>

@715
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks, I will go to the lab."
<es>

@718
<en>{Rin}\n"No worries.\nBy the way, what is it? The back hole thing you were saying earlier?"
<es>

@719

@724
<en>The door was open.\nBut it's dark.
<es>

@725
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka! Are you here?!!!"
<es>

@727
<en>(A sound of shattering)
<es>

@728
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What was that......?"
<es>

@729
<en>It sounded like glass fell and shattered.\nIt's from the end room of the building.
<es>

@732
<en>{Haruka}\n"No!\nWhy is this happening?!!!"
<es>

@733
<en>An irritating voice.\nIt is Haruka.
<es>

@737
<en>I see Haruka standing in the end of the room breathing hard from frustration. On the floor, a broken flask and some kind of liquid must been inside it.
<es>

@738
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka."
<es>

@741
<en>I tried to say her name as quietly as possible so I won't surprise her. She still got little surprised and turned around. She was about to cry.
<es>

@743
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi......?"
<es>

@746
<en>She recognized it was me and got relaxed.\n-- only for a split of a second.\nShe looks down again.
<es>

@747
<en>{Haruka}\n"What are you doing here so late?"
<es>

@748
<en>I know she still feels resposible for what happened today.
<es>

@749
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you doing here?\nI heard you've been locked in yourself here all day.\nWhat are you doing?"
<es>

@751
<en>I walked toward the end of the room where she is.\nI noticed inside the room is all messed up.
<es>

@752
<en>There are more broken flasks.\nUnfamilir tools and medicines are scattered on the floor.
<es>

@753
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are these?"

@756
<en>{Haruka}\n"Whatever I try...I keep failing...I don't know why......"
<es>

@757
<en>She responds to me in pain.\nShe must have been here almost 10 hours by now.
<es>

@758
<en>No wonder she seems exhausted.
<es>

@759
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't know what happened to me.\nI've never kept failing like this before."
<es>

@760
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."

@761
<en>{Haruka}\n"Even when I first tried alchemy, I was able to succeed.\nYeah, it was an easy one, but still I was able to."
<es>

@762
<en>{Kazushi}\n"On your first try?\nWow, you are talented."
<es>

@765
<en>{Haruka}\n"My grand ma told me I have potential.\nShe was so supportive about me persuing alchemy, too."
<es>

@766
<en>For a moment, she looked very happy.
<es>

@767
<en>She grew up admiring Principal, it must be very important for Haruka that Principal saw potential in Haruka.
<es>

@770
<en>{Haruka}\n"I can't do anything now.\nMaybe I deserve this for putting you in a danger."
<es>

@771
<en>She smiles helplessly.\nIt's obvious she's very weak now.
<es>

@773
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, why don't you take a little break? When things are not going your way, sometimes the best way to cure your problem is to take a good break. You can try again after the break."
<es>

@775
<en>{Haruka}\n"......maybe you are right.\nMaybe I need a break......"
<es>

@777
<en>She sat down on a chair like a worn out doll.\nI can't see her face, but I know her heart must be crying.
<es>

@778

<es>

@779
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I sit with you?"

@780
<en>She nods her head without a word.\nI brought a chair and sat down in front of her.

@789
<en>{Haruka}\n"What my grand ma said today really made me think. I used to think the purpose of me using alchemy is different from hers, but in the end, it wasn't so different from hers."
<es>

@791
<en>{Haruka}\n"Maybe how I keep failing on alchemy experiments means I should not use it anymore."
<es>

@792
<en>Everything she says sounds very negative.\nShe has absolutely no confidence anymore.\nI've been there once.

<es>

@794

<es>

@797

<es>

@803
<en>Haruka closed her eyes as if she's trying to listen to her own breathing.
<es>

@804

<es>

@1129
<en>I've gone through something like this before of my own. It's usually the small thing that you need to take care of to come over a slump. For her case, the reason is......
<es>

@1130
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am the reason."
<es>

@1131
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Haruka is a kind of girl who takes good responsibility on whatever she does. Someone like her can be keep failing from being excessively nervous from a past mistake."

<es>

@1142

<es>

@1247
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Isn't this because it's been so hot lately?\nOr maybe they just need more water."
<es>

@1248
<en>{Haruka}\n"Remember these flowers are not ordinary flowers?\nIt's not because of not getting enough water.\nThese flowers need the energy of this island."
<es>

@1249
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Energy from the island?"
<es>

@1250
<en>{Haruka}\n"In order to do so, I need to visualize them growing healthy. I also need to make good fertilizer for them."
<es>

@1251
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't understand everything you said, but it sure sounds very difficult. You've always been able to do that, and to me, that's amazing."

@1259
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......oops."
<es>

@1260
<en>Maybe I shouldn't try to remember that day.\nI'm sure Haruka wouldn't want me to remember how she was that day.
<es>

@1263
<en>{Haruka}\n"......something wrong?"
<es>

@1264
<en>She noticed something different and look me up.

@1274
<en>Come on, make it disappear.\nAt least just for now.
<es>

@1277
<en>{Haruka}\n"Remember all the flowers were blooming that day?\nThat was the first time I've ever seen it happened."
<es>

@1278
<en>{Kazushi}\n"First time? Why?\nAren't flowers supposed to bloom every year?"
<es>

@1279
<en>{Haruka}\n"I told you these are not ordinary flowers.\nEven within the same kind, flowers are little different depends on how well you took care of it."
<es>

@1280
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Different kind within the same kind?"
<es>

@1281
<en>{Haruka}\n"Just like alchemy.\nThere are stages. It depends on how far we can improve each flowers."
<es>

@1282
<en>{Haruka}\n"The white flowers we saw that day belongs to the highest stage. That was the first time I saw flowers bloom like that."
<es>

@1283
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?\nI didn't know how lucky I was till now."
<es>

@1284
<en>I didn't know how lucky I was. I've actually been pretty lucky my whole life.
<es>

@1285
<en>Maybe I'm using up all my luck on something not so important.
<es>

@1288
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't think it happened by an accident."
<es>

@1289
<en>Haruka smiled at me for some reason.
<es>

@1290
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't think you were there by an accident."
<es>

@1291
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean?"
<es>

@1294
<en>{Haruka}\n"You didn't happen to be where flowers bloomed.\nIt's the opposite.\nThe flowers bloomed because you were there."
<es>

@1295
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They bloomed because I was there?\n..................why?"
<es>

@1296
<en>Why did they bloom because I was there?\nIn what way was I involved?
<es>

@1297
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That was just coincident I was there.\nI didn't do anything."
<es>

@1298
<en>That's right. I didn't do anything.\nAll I did was just being there.
<es>

@1299
<en>{Haruka}\n"But it was exactly the same way when it happened for my grand parents."
<es>

@1300
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What's exactly the same?"
<es>

@1303
<en>{Haruka}\n"No! It's nothing!"
<es>

@1304
<en>Haruka evaded my question. I wonder what meant by exactly the same with her grand parents. It bothers me.
<es>

@1307
<en>{Haruka}\n"You know my grand ma has been observing you?\nShe thinks something special is going to happen to you."
<es>

@1308
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Principal? Seriously?"
<es>

@1309
<en>She has her eyes on me?\nThat's not good at all.
<es>

@1310

@1311

<es>

@1312
<en>I would be in awe if I could do any of those.\nBut at the same time, I know I don't have talent in those.
<es>

@1315
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm positive it happened because of you.\nHowever, I don't know exactly how you made it happen.\nThat's why we've been observing you."
<es>

@1316
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What......observing?"
<es>

@1317
<en>Observing-- it took me a while to understand what she said.
<es>

@1318
<en>{Haruka}\n"You must have something special.\nThat special thing will give us a hint for us to improve......"
<es>

@1319
<en>She looks straight into my eyes and let it out.
<es>

@1322

<es>

@1323

<es>

@1327
<en>{Haruka}\n"Do you understand now?"
<es>

@1328
<en>Is this Haruka I know?\nIt seemed like somebody replaced her.
<es>

@1331
<en>{Haruka}\n"Are you in shock?"
<es>

@1332
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......no."
<es>

@1333
<en>If I understand her words by words, I would probably get shocked though.
<es>

@1336
<en>{Haruka}\n"Aren't you disgusated at me?\nI got close to you because my grand ma ordered me to."
<es>

@1337
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see.\nBut you didn't have to tell me that."
<es>

@1340
<en>{Haruka}\n"You didn't want to know?"
<es>

@1341
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't care,. but I think you are the one who wanted me to not know.\nYou didn't have to be so caring for me."
<es>

@1343
<en>Haruka looks at me in disbelief.
<es>

@1346

<es>

@1347
