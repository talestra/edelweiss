<en>{Principal}\n"I see..."
<es>

@10
<en>That was all Principal said after hearing what we had to say.
<es>

@15
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"So is that what you two decided?"
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes."
<es>

@20
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sorry for the selfishness......."
<es>

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But no matter what you two say or even if the whole world is opposing to us being together, I have no intension of leaving Mei."
<es>

@24
<en>{Mei}\n"I want to be with Kazushi too."
<es>

@25
<en>We talked and decided. Well, we really didn't need to talk too much about it. We just followed our instincts.
<es>

@29
<en>{Principal}\n"But, as a result, Ms. Ibuki...Mei 's extinction will be advanced. It is a very cruel reality."
<es>

@30
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am aware of that."
<es>

@31
<en>That is a very harsh reality. Also a sad future that is very hard to admit.
<es>

@32
<en>{Principal}\n"Is it OK with you, Mei?"
<es>

@37
<en>{Mei}\n"I am OK. Kazushi is the one who will truly suffer."
<es>

@42
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"You maybe right. One who gets left behind suffers more. Is that OK with you, Kazushi?"
<es>

@43
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I want to make Mei happy my way."
<es>

@47
<en>{Mei}\n"I want to make Mei very, very happy!"
<es>

@48
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@49
<en>I was astonished. Did't I say it the right way?
<es>

@50
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do I need to rephrase it?"
<es>

@53
<en>{Mei}\n"......................"
<es>

@54
<en>She confirmed without saying a word. Oh, well.
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I want to make Mei very, very happy."
<es>

@56
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It just doesn't sound right if I say it again.... It was going so well......."
<es>

@62
<en>{Principal}\n"Chuckle......."
<es>

@63
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahh.........."
<es>

@64
<en>Principal is looking down and her shoulders are shaking. This is unusual. Principal is trying not to laugh.
<es>

@67
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Ha, ha, ha. Ok, I can see two of you are very happy. I see, Mei is happy.........."
<es>

@71
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, I am."
<es>

@74
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"What do you think, Hisae?"
<es>

@75
<en>Principal wiped her tears while still looking down. Was it that funny? Maybe she isn't as scary as I thought.
<es>

@80
<en>{Principal}\n"If that's what Mei...the both of you want, then, that's what you should do."
<es>

@81
<en>Principal said so rather bluntly, without too many words. Mei grabs my hand with such joy.
<es>

@85
<en>{Mei}\n"Thank you, both of you."
<es>

@86
<en>She is smiling from the bottom of her heart, there's no question about that.
<es>

@87
<en>It's not like I just noticed it, but...she is absolutely beautiful! Principal and Mr.Mr.Miya are glued on her smile.
<es>

@90
<en>{Mei}\n"Both of you, thank you for creating me. I will be happy."
<es>

@91
<en>Her head is still down. I took a bow next to her also.
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will make her happy, I promise. Thank you very much."
<es>

@95
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, then...excuse us."
<es>

@103
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Whew. I was nervous..."
<es>

@106
<en>{Principal}\n"I know. I don't even know how long it has been since I laughed like that. It must have been dozens of years, at least."
<es>

@107
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I feel like my daughter just got married......."
<es>

@110
<en>{Principal}\n"That will happen for real in the future, right?"
<es>

@113
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Well......I sure hope so."
<es>

@114
<en>{Principal}\n"To be honest, I really wasn't interested in Mei Ibuki herself. She was simply a convenient one to use for the experiment."
<es>

@117
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"I'm sure that's how it started. That's how you were."
<es>

@120
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"But you sure took a very good care of Mei. You kept her close to you and loved her."
<es>

@123
<en>{Principal}\n"That's only because she came out as such a beautiful girl. I was so ashamed of my vulgarity."
<es>

@126
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Mei sure was beautiful. She is basically a clone of Mei Ibuki, but how could she be so different?"
<es>

@129
<en>{Principal}\n"I don't know.........maybe more highly advanced and completely different soul got into that body."
<es>

@132
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"What do you mean by highly advanced?"
<es>

@135
<en>{Principal}\n"No, I'm just joking. But somehow, I feel like I've met her somewhere a long time ago......."
<es>

@136
<en>{Mr.Miya}\n"Long time ago?"
<es>

@139
<en>{Principal}\n"No, I am really, just joking."
<es>

@145
<en>I opened the door quietly and looked in.
<es>

@146
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't see anybody."
<es>

@149
<en>{Mei}\n"It's a summer break."
<es>

@150
<en>Out of the blue, Mei said she wanted to see the classroom, so we stopped on the way.
<es>

@151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It feels so different when there is nobody in it."
<es>

@152
<en>{Mei}\n"You are right."
<es>

@154
<en>I sat at my desk. It has been over a month since I sat at my desk. I couldn't feel comfortable because it felt like it belonged to someone else.
<es>

@157
<en>{Mei}\n"This was Mizuki's seat, right?"
<es>

@158
<en>Mei sat down at the desk next to mine. It was such a refreshing feeling, it almost felt like it was the first day of school.
<es>

@159
<en>{Mei}\n"If I was same age as you, we could have taken the same classes together."
<es>

@160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's OK,. Only because you were my teacher, we were able to face each other every day."
<es>

@163
<en>{Mei}\n"Do you think so? I rather look at the same direction together than face each other."
<es>

@164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you?"
<es>

@167
<en>{Mei}\n"Because if we were to walk together, we can't walk facing each other, can we?"
<es>

@168
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, you are right, but......if we were to hug, we can't do it facing the same direction, right?"
<es>

@171
<en>{Mei}\n"Are you thinking about something horny again???"
<es>

@172
<en>She sounds little sulky. But, her shoulder touches mine. We are very close.
<es>

@175
<en>{Mei}\n"Mmmm.........."
<es>

@176
<en>Mei puckers up. I put my lips on her lips that remind me of roses. This is our first kiss in the classroom.
<es>

@177
<en>{Mei}\n"Ahh......mmm.........."
<es>

@178
<en>I let go of her lips. Her eyes are already dewy with just a kiss.
<es>

@179
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I kiss you again?"
<es>

@180
<en>{Mei}\n"Yeah......."
<es>

@181
<en>Mei nods. We wanted to embrace each other whenever we had a chance. That's how we felt.
<es>

@182
<en>Neither one of us even mention, but we both knew this might be the last time we will ever be in the classroom together.
<es>

@183
<en>Our time together might not last until the new semester.
<es>
