@9
<en>{Principal}\n"I see..."
<es>

@10
<en>That was all the principal said after hearing our decision.
<es>

@15
<en>{Miya}\n"Is this what you've decided together?"
<es>

@16
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes."
<es>

@20
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sorry for being selfish......"
<es>

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But no matter what you two say, no matter if the whole world is opposed to us being together, I have no intention of leaving Mei."
<es>

@24
<en>{Mei}\n"I want to be with Kazushi-kun too."
<es>

@25
<en>That was what we decided after our talk. Well, there wasn't much to talk about though. We simply followed our honest feelings.
<es>

@29
<en>{Principal}\n"But as a result, Ibuki-sensei... Mei's disappearance will only be hastened. That may sound cruel, but it is an undeniable truth."
<es>

@30
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am aware of that."
<es>

@31
<en>It was a harsh reality, and a sad future that was very hard to accept.
<es>

@32
<en>{Principal}\n"But what about you, Mei?"
<es>

@37
<en>{Mei}\n"I'll be alright. Kazushi-kun is the one who will truly suffer."
<es>

@42
<en>{Miya}\n"You may be right. Partings are always hardest for those left behind. And yet, Kazushi-kun...?"
<es>

@43
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I want to make Mei happy in my own way."
<es>

@47
<en>{Mei}\n"I want to make Mei MEIjorly happy."
<es>

@48
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?!"
<es>

@49
<en>I was astonished. She corrected me.
<es>

@50
<en>{Kazushi}\n"D-do I need to rephrase it?"
<es>

@53
<en>{Mei}\n"....................."
<es>

@54
<en>A silent yes. O-oh, well...
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I want to make Mei MEIjorly happy."
<es>

@56
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...hey, it doesn't sound right to say something like this again. We had such a good mood going."
<es>

@62
<en>{Principal}\n"......Pff."
<es>

@63
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah........."
<es>

@64
<en>The principal was looking down and her shoulders were shaking. This was unusual: The principal was trying not to laugh.
<es>

@67
<en>{Miya}\n"Hahaha, I can tell you two sure are happy. I see, so Mei-chan's happy..."
<es>

@71
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes, very much so."
<es>

@74
<en>{Miya}\n"Hisae-san, what do you think?"
<es>

@75
<en>The principal wiped her tears while still looking down. Was it that funny? Maybe she wasn't as scary as I thought.
<es>

@80
<en>{Principal}\n"If that's what Mei... the both of you want, then go ahead."
<es>

@81
<en>The principal said so rather bluntly, without many words. Mei grabbed my hand with such joy.
<es>

@85
<en>{Mei}\n"Thank you, both of you."
<es>

@86
<en>Her smile was true. It's kind of late to ask, but was Mei always this beautiful? Both the principal and Miya-san's eyes were glued to her smile.
<es>

@87
<en>Mei let go of my hand and then faced the two of them. She bowed deeply to them.
<es>

@90
<en>{Mei}\n"Both of you, thank you for creating me. I will be happy."
<es>

@91
<en>Her head was still down. I took a bow next to her too.
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will make her happy, I promise. Thank you very much."
<es>

@95
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, then...excuse us."
<es>

@103
<en>{Miya}\n"Phew, I was kind of nervous."
<es>

@106
<en>{Principal}\n"Indeed. It's been a while since I've laughed and smiled. How many decades has it been?"
<es>

@107
<en>{Miya}\n"I feel like I just saw my daughter off at her wedding."
<es>

@110
<en>{Principal}\n"Except one day, that will happen to you for real."
<es>

@113
<en>{Miya}\n"Yes... I sure hope so."
<es>

@114
<en>{Principal}\n"To be honest, I didn't care one bit about the person named Ibuki Mei. She just happened to be a perfect test subject."
<es>

@117
<en>{Miya}\n"I'm sure that's how it started. That's how you were."
<es>

@120
<en>{Miya}\n"But you sure took very good care of Mei-chan. You kept her close to you and loved her."
<es>

@123
<en>{Principal}\n"That's only because she came out as such a beautiful girl. I was so ashamed of my vulgarity."
<es>

@126
<en>{Miya}\n"Mei-chan sure was beautiful. She was basically a clone of Ibuki Mei, so how could she be so different?"
<es>

@129
<en>{Principal}\n"Who knows... perhaps a different soul of a higher-order took up residence in that body."
<es>

@132
<en>{Miya}\n"What do you mean by higher order?"
<es>

@135
<en>{Principal}\n"No, I'm only joking. But somehow, I feel like I've met her somewhere a long time ago......"
<es>

@136
<en>{Miya}\n"A long time ago?"
<es>

@139
<en>{Principal}\n"No, I really am just kidding."
<es>

@145
<en>I opened the door quietly and looked in.
<es>

@146
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't see anybody."
<es>

@149
<en>{Mei}\n"It's a summer break."
<es>

@150
<en>Mei said she wanted to see the classroom out of the blue, so we stopped on the way.
<es>

@151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It feels so different when there's nobody in it."
<es>

@152
<en>{Mei}\n"It does."
<es>

@154
<en>I sat at my desk. It had been over a month since I sat there. I couldn't feel comfortable because it felt like it belonged to someone else.
<es>

@157
<en>{Mei}\n"This was Hinata-san's seat, right?"
<es>

@158
<en>Mei sat down at the desk next to mine. It was such a refreshing feeling, almost like it was the first day of school.
<es>

@159
<en>{Mei}\n"If I was the same age as you, we could have taken the same classes together."
<es>

@160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's OK. Since you were my teacher, we were able to look at each other every day."
<es>

@163
<en>{Mei}\n"Do you think so? I'd rather we were looking together in the same direction than facing each other."
<es>

@164
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you?"
<es>

@167
<en>{Mei}\n"Because if we were to walk together, we can't walk facing each other, can we?"
<es>

@168
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, you're right, but......if we were to hug, we can't do it facing the same direction, right?"
<es>

@171
<en>{Mei}\n"Ohh, there you go with your naughty thoughts again."
<es>

@172
<en>She sounded a little sulky. But, her shoulder touched mine. We were very close.
<es>

@175
<en>{Mei}\n"Mmm........."
<es>

@176
<en>Mei stuck out her rosy lips, and I place mine on top of them. It was the first time we kissed in the classroom.
<es>

@177
<en>{Mei}\n"Ahh......mmm........."
<es>

@178
<en>Our lips parted. With that one kiss, Mei's eyes began to water.
<es>

@179
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......Can I kiss you again?"
<es>

@180
<en>{Mei}\n"Yeah......"
<es>

@181
<en>Mei nods. We wanted to embrace each other whenever we had a chance. That's how we felt.
<es>

@182
<en>Neither one of us even mentioned it, but we both knew this might be the last time we would ever be in the same classroom together.
<es>

@183
<en>Our time together might not last until the new semester.
<es>
