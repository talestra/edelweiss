@7
<en>The next day, I went into the village with no real destination in mind.
<es>

@8
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder if there are any part-time jobs available? Not like I'd make that much in one day anyways."
<es>

@9
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Hey, young man! What's wrong? You look like you're in poor shape."
<es>

@10
<en>The man at the grocery store said hello to me.
<es>

@11
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do I really look that way?"
<es>

@12
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Yeah. If you look so darn dejected, then Lady Luck'll run right away from you."
<es>

@13
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? Even Lady Luck?"
<es>

@14
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Yep, she'll tuck her tail and skedaddle. What's wrong, you got money troubles?"
<es>

@15
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Actually, kind of."
<es>

@16
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Then all the worse! You've gotta put on a prosperous face or your business'll go south."
<es>

@17
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? I see."
<es>

@18
<en>He's right. Nothing good'll come from looking misfortunate. I have to at least act prosperous.
<es>

@19
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Alright! Pops, money! Give me some money!"
<es>

@20
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"What? Now you're robbing me? Hey, Dear! Bring out my cleaver!!"
<es>

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, I'm joking, just kidding! Don't kill me!"
<es>

@22
<en>An old lady came out from around back with a huge cleaver in her hands scaring me.
<es>

@23
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Ahaha, I'm just messing with you! So, how much do you need?"
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well...100,000 yen."
<es>

@25
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"That's a lot of money. Bill collectors on your tail or something?"
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not really, I just need the money. Do you know of any jobs I can do? Any kind of work would be fine, even if it's a little harsh."
<es>

@27
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Well...we all got enough people working around here. Even during the summer, we don't get too many tourists coming to this island."
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right..."
<es>

@29
<en>If only college girls would come visit this island, then it'd be a bit more active. It was so quiet, even during summer break.
<es>

@30
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I guess I'll check down at the harbor. They say to hop on a boat if you can't repay your debts. Fishing's the best way to make money."
<es>

@31
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Nope. Never heard that before in my life, but I don't think there'll be much work to find down there either, especially during low tide."
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see. Thanks anyways!"
<es>

@33
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Hey, take this watermelon."
<es>

@34
<en>Using the cleaver, he cut the watermelon in half. Its pleasant smell filled the air.
<es>

@35
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"The watermelons on this island taste amazing. They're big and sweet."
<es>

@36
<en>Yeah, it did look juicy and delicious. I bit into before it started attracting any bugs.
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow! So sweet! You did this with alchemy too?"
<es>

@38
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Yup. Alchemy's some amazing stuff."
<es>

@39
<en>If you really can turn lead into gold with alchemy, then it should be pretty easy to make 100,000 yen.
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess I just have to focus on one thing at a time. Thanks, pops!"
<es>

@41
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Good luck!"
<es>

@44
<en>The harbor was like a ghost town. No one was around.
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not a chance, huh?"
<es>

@46
<en>I looked down from edge of the cliff, which was dizzily high.
<es>

@47
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Looks pretty scary. You'd die instantly if you fell from here..."
<es>

@51
<en>{Mei}\n"Boo!!"
<es>

@52
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hhh!!?"
<es>

@54
<en>I jumped up in surprise and suddenly found there was no ground beneath my feet.
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wah! Wah! Waaah!!"
<es>

@58
<en>{Mei}\n"Watch out!"
<es>

@61
<en>Mei-sensei caught my body and pulled me back up off the ledge. I made it back to solid ground.
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I-I thought was going to die... Please don't surprise me like that in a place like this..."
<es>

@66
<en>{Mei}\n"Sorry. I was just kidding."
<es>

@67
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please pick a better time and place!"
<es>

@68
<en>{Mei}\n"Right, I'm really sorry. By the way, we're 500m above sea level, so if you did fall, you'd be a goner for sure."
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If you were aware of that, then be careful! Hahh..."
<es>

@70
<en>I was trembling.
<es>

@73
<en>{Mei}\n"But you're partly to blame for standing there like that, Haruma-kun. Anyone would want to give you a shove."
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Stop thinking such dangerous thoughts!"
<es>

@77
<en>{Mei}\n"Please don't be so upset. I'm not going to do it again."
<es>

@78
<en>Mei-sensei purred like a cat. Is this a women's technique to dodge the topic?
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fine then."
<es>

@80
<en>Actually, her technique was working...
<es>

@83
<en>{Mei}\n"What are you doing here? Worried about something?"
<es>

@84
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, in fact..."
<es>

@85
<en>Mei-sensei might lend it to me if I told her, but I couldn't rely on her like that.
<es>

@86
<en>{Mei}\n"What's the matter?"
<es>

@87
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm... Is it really true that alchemy can turn lead into gold?"
<es>

@88
<en>After hesitating, I asked something else. It wasn't entirely off topic, and it wasn't much different from a question I'd ask in class so she'd likely answer.
<es>

@91
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, it's good to hear you finally asking something about alchemy. You must be getting interested in it."
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, sort of..."
<es>

@93
<en>My motives seemed a bit impure...
<es>

@96
<en>{Mei}\n"But yes... Turning lead into gold is one of the ultimate goals of alchemy, so realistically doing so is difficult."
<es>

@97
<en>{Mei}\n"And if that's your reason for studying alchemy, I'd recommend quitting while you're ahead."
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That seems wrong? Alchemy was founded to profit humanity, so why can't you use it for money?"
<es>

@99
<en>Why should you give up on alchemy if money's your goal when it's supposed to create gold? That's a bit crazy.
<es>

@100
<en>{Mei}\n"It's because the true purpose of alchemy is much greater than that."
<es>

@101
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The true purpose...?"
<es>

@102
<en>I think Haruka said the same thing once. Is alchemy valuable for something other than making gold?
<es>

@103
<en>{Mei}\n"Of course, there is a technique for producing gold that's been passed down. It's rumored that Eiden Academy was built using treasure earned through such techniques."
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Our Academy? Through alchemy?"
<es>

@105
<en>{Mei}\n"Just a rumor, though."
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They should have built a better dorm for the boys, then."
<es>

@109
<en>{Mei}\n"Again it's just a rumor."
<es>

@110
<en>The boys' dorm put aside...
<es>

@111
<en>Our school was quite aged, but judging from the decorum, a lot of gold went into building it. To me, it held the extravagant taste of nouveau riche.
<es>

@112
<en>That was made with money earned through alchemy? How damn much gold did they create?
<es>

@115
<en>{Mei}\n"What are you thinking about? Again, it's only hearsay, so don't get too attached to the idea, okay?"
<es>

@116
<en>Guess I looked too serious. Mei-sensei advised me out of genuine concern.
<es>

@117
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I understand. It would be fascinating if it was true, though, don't you think?"
<es>

@120
<en>{Mei}\n"It is, but remember, alchemy works based on the principle of equivalent exchange. In other words, you'll have to pay an equivalent price in order to get it."
<es>

@121
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A price... huh."
<es>

@122
<en>I'm not quite sure what "principle of equivalent exchange" means, but I took it to be similar to "there's no such thing as a free lunch"."
<es>

@123
<en>It's true. More often than not, easy money is too good to be true.
<es>

@124
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, alchemy's not gonna work for me here, then."
<es>

@125
<en>All I could do was this...
<es>

@126
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mei-sensei, please forgive me for once."
<es>

@129
<en>{Mei}\n"What? What is it?"
<es>

@137
<en>{Ran}\n"Hey, hey. Have you seen Kazushi? I haven't seen him all day."
<es>

@143
<en>{Pierre}\n"Nope. We've been looking for him everywhere..."
<es>

@148
<en>{Appo}\n"Maybe he's sleeping somewhere. One of his skills IS the ability to pass out wherever he feels like."
<es>

@153
<en>{Daigo}\n"But he always wakes up before mealtimes. Isn't it too late for that?"
<es>

@157
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah..."
<es>

@161
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't tell me he ran out on me?!"
<es>

@162
<en>{Daigo}\n"Hmm? Ran out on you? What?"
<es>

@165
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh, no, nothing."
<es>

@168
<en>{Daigo}\n"I don't get what's going on, but Kazushi wouldn't run."
<es>

@171
<en>{Ran}\n"What?"
<es>

@174
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi wouldn't run. So I'm pretty sure you're just worrying over nothing, Kamoike."
<es>

@175
<en>{Ran}\n"Really? How do you know?"
<es>

@179
<en>{Pierre}\n"I just know. We go way back. We know a lot of about that guy."
<es>

@185
<en>{Appo}\n"Just leave him alone, he's fine. By the way, Fuu-chan wants to talk to you, Ran-chan."
<es>

@188
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Kazuko?"
<es>

@193
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Ran, are you hiding something from us?"
<es>

@194
<en>Ran looked puzzled by the sudden question. For one thing, it was Fuusen Kazuko asking her. They spoke casually of late, but there were never close friends.
<es>

@197
<en>{Ran}\n"Hiding something from you? I know there's plenty of things I don't tell you, but we were never a pair who told each other everything either."
<es>

@200
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You and me...maybe so. But what about... Haruka-chan or Mizuki-chan? Would you tell them something important?"
<es>

@201
<en>She had less and less of a clue what Kazuko was saying. What was she talking about? What did she want out of Ran?
<es>

@202
<en>{Ran}\n"What is this? Don't beat around the bush; just get to the point."
<es>

@203
<en>Her mind was on Kazushi right now. If he was sleeping then fine, but what if he got in an accident or something?
<es>

@204
<en>On the day he first arrived, he fell from the suspension bridge...
<es>

@205
<en>{Fuusen}\n"If you don't want to tell us, I won't force you. But in exchange, shut up and take this."
<es>

@206
<en>Kazuko handed Ran a brown envelope and her nose began to twitch. It had an all-too familiar smell inside.
<es>

@209
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Why? You're giving this to me?"
<es>

@210
<en>She was already opening the envelope as she asked. No, she was already looking inside. It was a wad of bills like she thought.
<es>

@211
<en>Nearly all 1,000 yen bills, and a few 10,000 yen ones too.
<es>

@214
<en>{Ran}\n"102,800 yen...right?"
<es>

@217
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Bingo! Wow, how'd you figure out the exact amount from just a glance? What are you?"
<es>

@220
<en>{Ran}\n"So, why are you giving this to me, Kazuko? ...Huh?"
<es>

@221
<en>Then she realized a bunch of girls were gathered behind Kazuko. There were about ten of them.
<es>

@224
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Hey, Ah-chan, guys, can you give us a bit?"
<es>

@229
<en>{Appo}\n"Sure, got it. Hey! Get out of the cafeteria, men!"
<es>

@233
<en>Appo took off with the guys, leaving the girls alone.
<es>

@234
<en>As a few of the girls surrounded Ran, she felt a bit intimidated.
<es>

@237
<en>{Ran}\n"What? What's with everyone?"
<es>

@245
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's our question. I thought we were friends."
<es>

@251
<en>{Ran}\n"What? What are you talking about?"
<es>

@259
<en>{Sakura}\n"Come on! Stop acting stupid, Ran! We all know it."
<es>

@260
<en>{Rin}\n"We know Haruma-kun has been trying to raise money for you."
<es>

@266
<en>{Ran}\n"Huh... Oh... 100,000 yen..."
<es>

@267
<en>There was just over 100,000 yen inside the envelope. Ran finally remembered asking Kazushi to lend her that much money.
<es>

@268
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Why did you guys bring it to me?"
<es>

@269
<en>Why did they do this? Did it have anything to do with Kazushi's disappearance?
<es>

@270
<en>{Ran}\n"Where's Kazushi?"
<es>

@275
<en>{Fuusen}\n"What? Has Haruma-kun disappeared?"
<es>

@276
<en>It seems Kazuko doesn't know his whereabouts either, and neither did any of the other girls. Where in the world is Haruma Kazushi?
<es>

@280
<en>{Andou}\n"Haruma-kun's missing? Don't tell me he ran out on you?"
<es>

@284
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, Kazushi wouldn't do that..."
<es>

@288
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's right. Kazushi-kun will take responsibility for it."
<es>

@292
<en>{Ran}\n"Umm, responsibility for what? What is this money for?"
<es>

@293
<en>"There's something going on behind my back..."\nRan was beginning to feel nervous.
<es>

@297
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Everyone donated some. It's 100,000 yen and a bit more. Is that enough?"
<es>

@298
<en>{Ran}\n"Enough? Enough for what?"
<es>

@299
<en>Ran had no clue what was going on. Why were the girls suddenly raising the money she'd asked to borrow from Kazushi?
<es>

@300
<en>This was making for a very oppressive atmosphere.
<es>

@304
<en>{Sakura}\n"So? Did you find a good doctor? I don't suggest using the clinic here on the island."
<es>

@307
<en>{Ran}\n"What? A doctor?"
<es>

@311
<en>{Rin}\n"I can ask a friend of mine to arrange a boat for you if you need one. And don't worry, he won't tell anyone."
<es>

@312
<en>{Ran}\n"Who needs a doctor? I don't?"
<es>

@316
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You don't need to hide it. We all know."
<es>

@319
<en>{Ran}\n"Maybe you do, but I've got no idea what you guys are talking about!"
<es>

@320
<en>Ran and the other girls stared at each other in silence.
<es>

@325
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hey, this sounds strange...doesn't it?"
<es>

@330
<en>{Rin}\n"Yes... she doesn't seem to be lying, either."
<es>

@337
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Maybe Ran's not really pregnant..."
<es>

@338
<en>Ran was astonished by what she just heard - and they weren't kidding.
<es>

@346
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Pregnant? Who the hell's baby am I supposed to be pregnant with?!"
<es>

@351
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Well... Haruma-kun's, right? Haruma-kun got you knocked up, and..."
<es>

@354
<en>{Ran}\n"W-why would I be pregnant with Kazushi's baby? Where'd you get that kind of crazy idea from?"
<es>

@355
<en>Ran was beet red. How in the world did she end up pregnant with Kazushi's kid?
<es>

@359
<en>{Mizuki}\n"See? I told you! I knew this whole thing sounded fishy."
<es>

@362
<en>{Fuusen}\n".................."
<es>

@366
<en>{Rin}\n"What am I going to do? I already made my special red bean rice for dinner tonight..."
<es>

@371
<en>{Ran}\n"Red bean rice? Rin, listen..."
<es>

@372
<en>Ran became even more flushed. It was rare to see her face that red.
<es>

@376
<en>{Sakura}\n"Well, we just can eat the rice for dinner. It wasn't a celebration anyways."
<es>

@381
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh, you're right... Even if she were pregnant, at the hospital the baby would be... right..."
<es>

@385
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Looks like that was false too. Well, in the end it's all good."
<es>

@389
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's not good! Kazuko, you're the one who said it in the first place!"
<es>

@392
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Well, it's because Kazushi was trying like crazy to raise that kind of money out of nowhere... What else would you think?"
<es>

@393
<en>Everyone sighed with relief. They thought Ran had become pregnant and Kazushi was trying to raise the money for an abortion.
<es>

@398
<en>{Ran}\n"How'd you come up with that idea? You all just jumped the gun."
<es>

@403
<en>{Haruka}\n"Because..."
<es>

@407
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Because you and Haruma-kun have been so close to each other lately."
<es>

@410
<en>{Ran}\n"Me and Kazushi? ...Is that how we looked?"
<es>

@414
<en>{Sakura}\n"By all means. Everyone thinks the same thing."
<es>

@418
<en>{Rin}\n"You started hanging out with us recently too, so we all figured that if you were in love that explained everything."
<es>

@422
<en>{Ran}\n"In love with someone?"
<es>

@423
<en>She became flushed again while everyone chuckled at her.
<es>

@426
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi's a nice guy, and I like him, but..."
<es>

@427
<en>But love didn't quite sound right. There wasn't any special relationship between them.
<es>

@428
<en>{Ran}\n"But Kazushi's gone now."
<es>

@429
<en>The guys said he wouldn't run away, but she had no clue.
<es>

@433
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Where did Kazushi go then?"
<es>

@437
<en>{Haruka}\n"All the food from lunch will be gone soon."
<es>

@442
<en>{Mei}\n"What's up, everyone?"
<es>

@443
<en>Mei-sensei approached the girls huddling together with a concerned look.
<es>

@444
<en>{Mei}\n"Anything wrong?"
<es>

@449
<en>{Fuusen}\n"No, there's nothing wrong. She's not pregnant."
<es>

@452
<en>{Mei}\n"What? Pregnant? What happened?"
<es>

@453
<en>Mei-sensei became really worried.
<es>

@457
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sensei, we haven't seen Haruma-kun around. Have you heard anything?"
<es>

@460
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, Haruma-kun."
<es>

@461
<en>Everyone felt she knew something about him from her tone.
<es>

@465
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Where is Haruma-kun?"
<es>

@468
<en>{Mei}\n"Umm, I told him no, you know? But Haruma-kun seemed to have his own reasons and insisted, so..."
<es>

@472
<en>{Ran}\n"Umm, I don't get it at all? Where is Kazushi?"
<es>

@475
<en>{Mei}\n"Umm... He went home."
<es>

@478
<en>{Ran}\n"..................What!?"
<es>

@486
<en>It was raining tonight.
<es>

@489
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow, it's really pouring down."
<es>

@490
<en>The rain woke Ran up and she went outside alone. Far below, she could see the sea churning beneath her.
<es>

@491
<en>{Ran}\n"The ocean's going wild."
<es>

@492
<en>You couldn't come back by boat in this. Kazushi probably wouldn't be back tonight.
<es>

@495
<en>{Ran}\n"Will he ever be coming back?"
<es>

@496
<en>Ran felt worried as she watched the turbulent waves.\n"I never thought Kazushi would leave the island. I shouldn't have said such a thing..."
<es>

@497
<en>{Ran}\n"He might enjoy his home."
<es>

@498
<en>She went home during her first New Year's break as a freshman. She felt so comfortable there that she didn't want to return to the island.
<es>

<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi might not be returning..."
<es>

@500
<en>"Why do I keep thinking so negatively? Was I always this pessimistic?" she thought.
<es>

@503
<en>{Ran}\n"What's wrong with me?"
<es>

@504
<en>She didn't feel like herself, and she couldn't calm down. It was the first time she had ever felt so restless.
<es>

@505
<en>It's just a guy who's been around for a while and isn't here anymore. That's it.
<es>

@508
<en>{Ran}\n"Geez...what that hell am I thinking and doing here?"
<es>

@509
<en>She knew standing here and getting soaked wouldn't help anything, but she couldn't move.
<es>

@510
<en>{Appo}\n"What're you doing here?"
<es>

@513
<en>Ran was startled to hear Appo's voice. She never expected to run into anyone outside at midnight.
<es>

@519
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You don't have to be that surprised, Ran."
<es>

@520
<en>Appo and Kazuko were holding each other's arms under one umbrella.
<es>

@523
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You're soaked. Is it your hobby to get soaking wet while watching the sea or something?"
<es>

@527
<en>{Ran}\n"Sort of. I feel like doing this once a year."
<es>

@530
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Alright. I won't say anything else, but be careful or you'll catch a cold even though it's summer."
<es>

@531
<en>Kazuko's tone was a bit curt, but Ran went beyond surprise at her concern and felt bashful. Kazuko really had changed lately.
<es>

@532
<en>...ever since she started seeing Appo.
<es>

@535
<en>{Ran}\n"Thanks for your concern. I'm going back now."
<es>

@536
<en>There was no point staying here any longer. It was almost time for lights out anyways.
<es>

@541
<en>{Appo}\n"Oh, yeah, we were heading to Fuu-chan's room. I probably won't be back until tomorrow afternoon."
<es>

@542
<en>Appo said as if talking to himself.
<es>

@543
<en>Ran thought he was bragging... but then realized it.
<es>

@548
<en>{Fuusen}\n"So that means there won't be anybody in your room, right? I don't think Haruma-kun will be back tonight..."
<es>

@549
<en>Kazuko's right. If Appo wasn't coming back to the room, then there would be no one in Kazushi's room.
<es>

@552
<en>{Appo}\n"Let's hurry up and get to yours!"
<es>

@555
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Hee-hee... I wonder how many times you'll send me to heaven tonight?"
<es>

@558
<en>Ran shuddered with disgust at their conversation, but reminded herself that they were a couple and it's totally OK for them to talk about stuff like that.
<es>

@559
<en>Then again, Ran didn't even want to imagine what they were planning to do.
<es>

@562
<en>{Fuusen}\n"You're not going back to the dorm, Ran?"
<es>

@567
<en>{Ran}\n"You go on ahead. I'll be back later."
<es>

@570
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Okay. See you then."
<es>

@573
<en>{Ran}\n"See you. You two have a good night."
<es>

@578
<en>{Ran}\n"It reeks..."
<es>

@579
<en>It was sweaty, and there's an unwashed smell of boys everywhere. This must be what a typical man's room was like.
<es>

@580
<en>It was quite a mess.
<es>

@581
<en>{Ran}\n"How can they sleep in here? Boys are really tough."
<es>

@582
<en>Ran searched for something to wipe herself off with and found a drawer with Kazushi's clothes. When she opened it she found a bath towel.
<es>

@583
<en>She borrowed it and wiped herself off.
<es>

@584
<en>{Ran}\n"I'll borrow his clothes, too..."
<es>

@585
<en>She took her wet clothes off and put on Kazushi's school shirt. She felt much better with a dry set of clothes on.
<es>

@586
<en>{Ran}\n *Ahhhhhhhhhhh*
<es>

@587
<en>Ran sat down by the window with the lights off. She didn't want to risk anyone peeking in and finding her.
<es>

@588
<en>She saw unmade beds laid out next to her.
<es>

@589
<en>{Ran}\n"Which one is...?"
<es>

@590
<en>Kazushi's?
<es>

@591
<en>{Ran}\n".................."
<es>

@593
<en>Ran gingerly smelled both of the mattresses.
<es>

@594
<en>{Ran}\n *sniff sniff*
<es>

@595
<en>{Ran}\n"What the hell am I doing? I'm acting like a dog..."
<es>

@596
<en>Maybe she was, because she could tell which one is Kazushi's by the scent.
<es>

@597
<en>{Ran}\n"How could I tell?"
<es>

@598
<en>She didn't know. She'd never paid attention to his scent before, but she knew at first sniff.
<es>

@599
<en>{Ran}\n"Okay, maybe just a little bit."
<es>

@601
<en>She laid down on Kazushi's bed, putting her forehead on his pillow and breathing in his scent.
<es>

@602
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow..."
<es>

@603
<en>She sighed deeply, and really felt like she was being a woman.
<es>

@604
<en>{Ran}\n"Uh... I'm getting horny..."
<es>

@605
<en>She was starting to have fun. She was having fun knowing that she was getting turned on. She buried her face in his pillow and held it close.
<es>

@607
<en>{Ran}\n"Hahaha. I'm totally acting like a pervert."
<es>

@609
<en>She flapped her legs around on his futon as she held the pillow close. As she took a deep breath of his scent her head became dizzy.
<es>

@610
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmm... Shortage of oxygen..."
<es>

@611
<en>She toned herself down, and as she closed her eyes, her consciousness began to fade. She could feel herself growing relaxed.
<es>

@612
<en>And as she relaxed she grew sleepy.
<es>

@613
<en>Wearing Kazushi's clothes and towel and sleeping in his futon, she felt like she was enveloped in his presence.
<es>

@614
<en>{Ran}\n"Uh... I'm so sleepy..."
<es>

@616
<en>If she fell asleep, she'd have a nice night's rest. She couldn't win against that temptation, and Ran steadily drifted off to sleep.
<es>

@617
<en>{Ran}\n"Uhh..."
<es>

@618
<en>It was quiet outside now. The rain must have stopped. The quiet, dim room was just like an aquarium at night.
<es>

@619
<en>{Ran}\n"I really am falling asle..."
<es>

@620
<en>"I wonder if anything good is going to happen when I wake up tomorrow."\nThinking that, Ran went into a deep, deep slumber.
<es>
