@7
<en>Next day. I just went to town.
<es>

@8
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder if there is any part-time job available, although I may not be able to make much in a day."
<es>

@9
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Hey, what's up? You look so depressed!"
<es>

@10
<en>Grocery store worker says hello to me.
<es>

@11
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do I look, really?"
<es>

@12
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Yeah. If you look damn so dejected, all the good luck will run away from you."
<es>

@13
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, shit! Really? Mammon too?"
<es>

@14
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Of course. What's up? You want money?"
<es>

@15
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes."
<es>

@16
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Then you had better not look so down. It makes things worse!"
<es>

@17
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, shit! Really?"
<es>

@18
<en>He is right. I try not to look down.
<es>

@19
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay! Hey, give me some money, will you?"
<es>

@20
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"What? Are you a burglar or something? Hey, bring me a gun!!"
<es>

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No! Just kidding. Please don't kill me!"
<es>

@22
<en>Someone comes out with a big knife in her hand.
<es>

@23
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Hahaha. I know I was kidding myself. How much do you want?"
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well...100.000 yen."
<es>

@25
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"That's a lot of money. Are you in debt or something?"
<es>

@26
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not really. I just need that money. Do you know any job I can work? Any kind of work will do. Even a little tough one I don't mind..."
<es>

@27
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Well...we all got enough people working around here. Even during the summer, we don't get to see many tourists coming to this island."
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I know..."
<es>

@29
<en>How come we don't have visitors like a bunch of girls to this place? This town is damn so quiet.
<es>

@30
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I will check to see if there is any job opportunity at the harbor. People say if you want money, go fishing. You know?"
<es>

@31
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"No. Never heard of it, but I don' think there is much work to do there either, especially during low tide."
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will see... Thanks anyway."
<es>

@33
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Hey, take this watermelon."
<es>

@34
<en>With the big knife, he cut the watermelon in half. Its pleasant smell gets around.
<es>

@35
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"This watermelon tastes very good. It's big and sweet."
<es>

@36
<en>Yes, it does look very sweet. I gobble up the fruit.
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow! So sweet! You did this with alchemy too?"
<es>

@38
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Yeah. Alchemy is just amazing."
<es>

@39
<en>If you can really turn lead into gold with alchemy, it should be damn easy to make 100.000 yen.
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But I guess I just have to work one thing at a time."
<es>

@41
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Good luck!"
<es>

@44
<en>The harbor is quiet. No one is around.
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not chance, huh?"
<es>

@46
<en>I looked down from the headland, which is dizzily high.
<es>

@47
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It looks pretty scary. You would be dead instantly if you fell from here..."
<es>

@51
<en>{Mei}\n"Wah!!"
<es>

@52
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!!?"
<es>

@54
<en>I jumped up in surprise, and almost made a false step.
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wah...Wah...Uh!!"
<es>

@58
<en>{Mei}\n"Watch out!"
<es>

@61
<en>Ms. Ibuki catches my body and pulls me up to the ground. I now landed okay.
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whew, I thought I'd die! Don't startle me, Ms. Ibuki!"
<es>

@66
<en>{Mei}\n"Sorry. I was just kidding."
<es>

@67
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't be. Not here, please."
<es>

@68
<en>{Mei}\n"You are right. It's just so that you know it's 500 meters high from here. And if you fall, you are not gonna make it."
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You didn't think I would not know that?"
<es>

@70
<en>I am still trembling.
<es>

@73
<en>{Mei}\n"Part of it is your fault. Because you were standing alone at the place like here. It'd make anyone want to push you over, you know?"
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are out of your mind, Ms. Ibuki."
<es>

@77
<en>{Mei}\n"Don't be so upset, please. I won't do that again."
<es>

@78
<en>Ms. Ibuki purrs like a cat. Is this a women's technique to dodge the topic?
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Never mind..."
<es>

@80
<en>Actually, this technique is working.
<es>

@83
<en>{Mei}\n"What are you doing here? Worried about something?"
<es>

@84
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, in fact..."
<es>

@85
<en>Should I tell her the truth? Can I rely on my teacher?
<es>

@86
<en>{Mei}\n"What's the matter?"
<es>

@87
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is it really true that alchemy can turn lead into gold?"
<es>

@88
<en>I asked her something different - well, not totally different. This is more of a class room question.
<es>

@91
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, it's good to know you ask something about alchemy. You must be getting interested in it."
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, sort of..."
<es>

@93
<en>With inappropriate motivation...maybe?
<es>

@96
<en>{Mei}\n"Turning lead into gold is the ultimate purpose of alchemy. But that is nearly impossible to achieve."
<es>

@97
<en>{Mei}\n"And if that is your purpose to study alchemy, I would say you are wasting your time."
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ms, Ibuki, it sounds a bit strange to me. Because It's alchemy, after all. Why is it that an idea of making money should not be a motivation?"
<es>

@99
<en>It sounds odd because originally alchemy is about changing lead into gold. So why did she say we should not have that kind of motivation?
<es>

@100
<en>{Mei}\n"It's because the true purpose of alchemy is a lot greater than that."
<es>

@101
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The true purpose...?"
<es>

@102
<en>Haruka said the same thing. Is there any greater purpose than making gold?
<es>

@103
<en>{Mei}\n"Of course, there is the gold-producing technique passed on over generations. In fact, I heard our school was built because of huge treasure made by alchemy."
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The school? By alchemy?"
<es>

@105
<en>{Mei}\n"Just a rumor, though."
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They should have made a better male dorm, then."
<es>

@109
<en>{Mei}\n"Again it's just a rumor."
<es>

@110
<en>The male dorm put aside...
<es>

@111
<en>The school looks old, but does have so many luxurious decorations everywhere. They must have spent a lot of money to build that school.
<es>

@112
<en>And all the money was made by alchemy? How much was all together?
<es>

@115
<en>{Mei}\n"What are you thinking? Again, that is only hearsay. So don't get into this, okay?"
<es>

@116
<en>It seems I looked so serious. Ms. Ibuki made sure I would not get hooked on that rumor.
<es>

@117
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I understand. If this is true, however, it's fascinating, don't you think?"
<es>

@120
<en>{Mei}\n"But alchemy works only based on the principle of equivalency exchanges. In other words, you will end up paying for the high price, you know?"
<es>

@121
<en>{Kazushi}\n"High price..."
<es>

@122
<en>I'm not quite sure of what the principle of equivalency exchanges means, but it sounds more like "there is no free lunch".
<es>

@123
<en>Making money without any hard work...It's just too good to be true.
<es>

@124
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, alchemy is not gonna work for me then."
<es>

@125
<en>All I can do is this...
<es>

@126
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ms. Ibuki, please forgive me for once."
<es>

@129
<en>{Mei}\n"What? What is it?"
<es>

@137
<en>{Ran}\n"Did you see Kazushi? I don't see him."
<es>

@143
<en>{Pierre}\n"No. We are also looking for him everywhere."
<es>

@148
<en>{Appo-}\n"Maybe, he is sleeping somewhere. He can sleep anyplace, which is one of his skills."
<es>

@153
<en>{Daigo}\n"But he always wakes up right before the meal. Isn't it too late?"
<es>

@157
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah..."
<es>

@161
<en>{Ran}\n"No, shit! He ran away?"
<es>

@162
<en>{Daigo}\n"Hmm? Ran way? What do you mean?"
<es>

@165
<en>{Ran}\n"Nothing..."
<es>

@168
<en>{Daigo}\n"He is not running away."
<es>

@171
<en>{Ran}\n"What?"
<es>

@174
<en>{Daigo}\n"He is not gonna just run away."
<es>

@175
<en>{Ran}\n"How do you know?"
<es>

@179
<en>{Pierre}\n"I just know. We go way back. We know a lot of about that guy."
<es>

@185
<en>{Appo-}\n"Just leave him also. He is fine. By the way, Fusen wanted to talk to you, Ran."
<es>

@188
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Kazuko?"
<es>

@193
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Ran, are you hiding something from us?"
<es>

@194
<en>Ran looks puzzled by the sudden question. Kazuko is a friend, but not very close to me. So why...?
<es>

@197
<en>{Ran}\n"Hiding from you? There are many things I don't tell you just because you and I are not that close to begin with. You know?"
<es>

@200
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"You and me...maybe so. How about you and Haruka and Mizuki? Do you tell them everything?"
<es>

@201
<en>I have no idea what Kazuko is talking about. What is this all about? What does she want from me?
<es>

@202
<en>{Ran}\n"What is this? Don't beat around the bush, Kazuko. Get to the point."
<es>

@203
<en>I'm now worried about Kazushi. I hope he is not involved in any accident.
<es>

@204
<en>One the first day of his arrival, he fell from the suspension bridge.
<es>

@205
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"If you don't want to tell me, that is okay. But I want you to take this."
<es>

@206
<en>Kazuko gave me a brown envelop. It smells something I love. I have a pretty sharp nose.
<es>

@209
<en>{Ran}\n"Why are you doing this?"
<es>

@210
<en>I already saw inside the envelope. It's money inside.
<es>

@211
<en>Quite a lot...
<es>

@214
<en>{Ran}\n"102.800 yen?"
<es>

@217
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Bingo! Wow! How did you figure out the exact amount so fast? Who are you?"
<es>

@220
<en>{Ran}\n"Are you giving me this, Kazuko? And why?"
<es>

@221
<en>Then I realized there were other students standing behind Kazuko. There are ten of then.
<es>

@224
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Hey, guys scoot!"
<es>

@229
<en>{Appo-}\n"Hey, guys. Let's get out of the cafeteria!"
<es>

@233
<en>Appo took all the guys out of the room, leaving the girls alone.
<es>

@234
<en>As a few girls surround Ran, she feels a bit intimidated,
<es>

@237
<en>{Ran}\n"What's going on?"
<es>

@245
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's our question. I thought we were friends."
<es>

@251
<en>{Ran}\n"What? What are you talking about?"
<es>

@259
<en>{Sakura}\n"Come on! Stop acting stupid, Ran! We all know it."
<es>

@260
<en>{Rin}\n"We know Kazushi has been trying to raise money for you."
<es>

@266
<en>{Ran}\n"Uh....Oh...100.000 yen..."
<es>

@267
<en>There is 100.000 yen inside the envelope. I now remember asking Kazushi to lend her the amount of money.
<es>

@268
<en>{Ran}\n"Why did you guys give me this, then?"
<es>

@269
<en>Why do they do this? Anything has to do with Kazushi's disappearance?
<es>

@270
<en>{Ran}\n"Where is Kazushi?"
<es>

@275
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"What? Kazushi is gone somewhere?"
<es>

@276
<en>It seems Kazuko doesn't know his whereabouts either. And neither do other girls. Where in the world is Kazushi?
<es>

@280
<en>{Rei}\n"What? You can't find Kazushi? Did he run away?"
<es>

@284
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, Kazushi wouldn't do that..."
<es>

@288
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's right. Kazushi will take responsibility for it."
<es>

@292
<en>{Ran}\n"What is it? Responsibility? What is this money for?"
<es>

@293
<en>There is something going on behind my back. Ran is beginning to feel anxious.
<es>

@297
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Everyone donated some. It's 100.000 yen and a bit more. Is that enough?"
<es>

@298
<en>{Ran}\n"Enough? Enough for what?"
<es>

@299
<en>I have no clues of what's happening. Why did they give this much money I initially asked Kazushi?
<es>

@300
<en>Beside, this is a very heavy atmosphere.
<es>

@304
<en>{Sakura}\n"So, did you find a good doctor? I don't suggest you use the clinic in the island?"
<es>

@307
<en>{Ran}\n"What? A doctor?"
<es>

@311
<en>{Rin}\n"If you need a boat, I can ask my friend to get you a boat. And don't worry he won't tell anyone."
<es>

@312
<en>{Ran}\n"Who needs a doctor? I'm fine..."
<es>

@316
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"You don't need to hide. We all know it."
<es>

@319
<en>{Ran}\n"Maybe, you do. But I have no idea what you guys are talking about."
<es>

@320
<en>Ran and the other girls stare at each other.
<es>

@325
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hey, it sounds very strange...doesn't it?"
<es>

@330
<en>{Rin}\n"Yes...She doesn't seem to be telling a lie."
<es>

@337
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Maybe, Ran is not really pregnant."
<es>

@338
<en>What? Ran is astonished by what she just heard. And they are not kidding.
<es>

@346
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Pregnant? Me? Pregnant? With whose baby?"
<es>

@351
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"You are not pregnant with Kazushi's? Kazushi knocked you up...didn't he?"
<es>

@354
<en>{Ran}\n"Why do I have to get pregnant with Kazushi's baby? Where did you get that kind of crazy idea?"
<es>

@355
<en>Ran becomes flushed. What is going on?
<es>

@359
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I told you! I knew this whole thing was so fishy."
<es>

@362
<en>{Hu-sen}\n".................."
<es>

@366
<en>{Rin}\n"What am I gonna do? I already made special red beans rice for Ran's baby shower..."
<es>

@371
<en>{Ran}\n"Red beans rice? For my baby shower...?"
<es>

@372
<en>Ran becomes even more flushed, which is pretty unusual.
<es>

@376
<en>{Sakura}\n"Well, we just can eat the rice for dinner. No big deal."
<es>

@381
<en>{Rin}\n"That's right. Please enjoy my cook."
<es>

@385
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"So now we don't have to worry about the hospital or things like that, huh?"
<es>

@389
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazuko, you are the one who started out saying this!"
<es>

@392
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Well, because suddenly Kazushi was trying hard to raise that kind of money...what else would you think?"
<es>

@393
<en>Everyone sighs with relief. They thought Ran became pregnant and Kazushi tried to collect the money for it.
<es>

@398
<en>{Ran}\n"How did you get the idea? You all just jumped the gun."
<es>

@403
<en>{Haruka}\n"Because..."
<es>

@407
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Because you and Kazushi have been so close to each other lately."
<es>

@410
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi and me...?"
<es>

@414
<en>{Sakura}\n"By all means. Everyone thinks the same thing."
<es>

@418
<en>{Rin}\n"You hang out with us more often nowadays. So we thought maybe because you love someone."
<es>

@422
<en>{Ran}\n"Love someone?"
<es>

@423
<en>I, again, become flushed while everyone is chuckling at me.
<es>

@426
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi is a nice guy and like him, but..."
<es>

@427
<en>But love is not the word I use to describe my relationship with him.
<es>

@428
<en>{Ran}\n"Where is Kazushi, anyway?"
<es>

@429
<en>The guys say he doesn't run away.
<es>

@433
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Where did Kazushi go then?"
<es>

@437
<en>{Haruka}\n"The food will soon be gone."
<es>

@442
<en>{Mei}\n"What's up, everyone?"
<es>

@443
<en>With a concerned look, Mei approaches the girls huddling together.
<es>

@444
<en>{Mei}\n"Anything wrong?"
<es>

@449
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"No. Nothing is wrong. She is not pregnant."
<es>

@452
<en>{Mei}\n"What? Pregnant? What happened?"
<es>

@453
<en>Mei becomes really worried.
<es>

@457
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ms. Ibuki, have you seen Kazushi?"
<es>

@460
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, Kazushi."
<es>

@461
<en>Everyone felt she knew something about him.
<es>

@465
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"So you have seen him? Do you know where he is now?"
<es>

@468
<en>{Mei}\n"I didn't agree...but he insisted, you know?"
<es>

@472
<en>{Ran}\n"What? Where is Kazushi now, Ms. Ibuki?"
<es>

@475
<en>{Mei}\n"Uh...he left the island and went home."
<es>

@478
<en>{Ran}\n"..................What!?"
<es>

@486
<en>It is raining at night.
<es>

@489
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow, it's pouring down rain."
<es>

@490
<en>The rain woke Ran up. She went outside alone and saw the sea heaving up.
<es>

@491
<en>{Ran}\n"Water is sweeping across the ocean."
<es>

@492
<en>The sea is too rough for the boat to return. I don't think Kazushi will be coming back tonight.
<es>

@495
<en>{Ran}\n"Will he ever be coming back?"
<es>

@496
<en>Watching the turbulent waves, Ran feels worried. I never thought Kazushi would leave the island. I should not have said such a thing...
<es>

@497
<en>{Ran}\n"He might enjoy his home."
<es>

@498
<en>It was the first winter break in my freshman year that I went home. I felt so comfortable at home that I didn't want to return the island.
<es>

@499
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi may not be returning..."
<es>

@500
<en>Why am I thinking so negatively?
<es>

@503
<en>{Ran}\n"What's wrong with me?"
<es>

@504
<en>I feel like this is not me. I have never had this feeling before.
<es>

@505
<en>It's just a person who has always been around is not here any more. That's it.
<es>

@508
<en>{Ran}\n"Gee...what that hell am I thinking and doing here?"
<es>

@509
<en>I am getting wet. But I don't know why I cannot move.
<es>

@510
<en>{Appo-}\n"Ran, what are you doing here?"
<es>

@513
<en>Ran got startled to hear Appo's voice. She never expected to meet anyone at midnight.
<es>

@519
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"You didn't have to be that surprised, Ran."
<es>

@520
<en>Under one umbrella, Appo and Kazuko are holding each other's arms.
<es>

@523
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Is watching the sea in soaking wet your habit or something?"
<es>

@527
<en>{Ran}\n"Sort of. I feel like doing this once a year."

<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Okay, I won't say any more. But be careful or you will catch a cold."
<es>

@531
<en>Kazuko said it bluntly, but Ran felt her concerns. Kazuko has definitely changed.
<es>

@532
<en>Since she has seen Appo.
<es>

@535
<en>{Ran}\n"Thanks for your concern. I will go back now."
<es>

@536
<en>There is no point being here any more. It's time to go back anyway.
<es>

@541
<en>{Appo-}\n"I am now going to Kazuko's room, and won't be back until tomorrow afternoon."
<es>

@542
<en>Appo said so loudly and fondly.
<es>

@543
<en>I hear you...what? Wait a minute...
<es>

@548
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"So that means no one is going to be in your room, huh? I don't think Kazushi will be back tonight."
<es>

@549
<en>Kazuko is right. There is going to be no one in their room tonight.
<es>

@552
<en>{Appo-}\n"Let's hurry up and go to your room, Kazuko!"
<es>

@555
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Hehe...I wonder how many times you can take me to heaven tonight..."
<es>

@558
<en>Ran shudders at their conversation, but reminds herself that they are couple and it's totally okay to talk stuff like that.
<es>

@559
<en>But then, Ran doesn't even want to picture what they are planning to do.
<es>

@562
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Ran, you are not going back to the dorm?"
<es>

@567
<en>{Ran}\n"You go ahead. I will go later."
<es>

@570
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Okay. See you then."
<es>

@573
<en>{Ran}\n"See you. You two have a good night."
<es>

@578
<en>{Ran}\n"It smells..."
<es>

@579
<en>It's sweaty and manly smell everywhere. This must be a typical men's room.
<es>

@580
<en>And it is quite messy.
<es>

@581
<en>{Ran}\n"How can they sleep in here?"
<es>

@582
<en>Ran looks for a bath towel, and finds it in a drawer.
<es>

@583
<en>She begins to wipe her body with it.
<es>

@584
<en>{Ran}\n"Let me borrow his clothes too."
<es>

@585
<en>She takes her wet cloth off and put Kazushi's school uniform shirt on. It feels warm and comfortable.
<es>

@586
<en>{Ran}\n"Ran sighs deeply."
<es>

@587
<en>Ran sits right by the window with the lights off. She doesn't want anyone to see her in the room.
<es>

@588
<en>Next to me, I see the futon mattresses.
<es>

@589
<en>{Ran}\n"Which one is...?"
<es>

@590
<en>Kazushi's?
<es>

@591
<en>{Ran}\n".................."
<es>

@593
<en>Ran gingerly smells at the both mattresses.
<es>

@594
<en>{Ran}\n"Ran sniffs."
<es>

@595
<en>{Ran}\n"What the hell am I doing? I am like a dog."
<es>

@596
<en>Maybe, I am. Because I can tell which one is Kazushi's by sniffing.
<es>

@597
<en>{Ran}\n"How could I tell?"
<es>

@598
<en>I don't even know how I did. I've never been so conscious about someone else's smell.
<es>

@599
<en>{Ran}\n"Okay, maybe just a little bit."
<es>

@601
<en>I lie down on Kazushi's futon and smell even more of him.
<es>

@602
<en>{Ran}\n"Wow..."
<es>

@603
<en>I sigh deeply. I really feel that I am being a woman.
<es>

@604
<en>{Ran}\n"Uh...I'm getting horny..."
<es>

@605
<en>It's getting fun. In fact, getting horny is fun. I bury my face in his pillow and embrace it tight.
<es>

@607
<en>{Ran}\n"Hahaha. I am acting really like a pervert."
<es>

@609
<en>Holding the pillow, I flap my legs up and down on the futon. I inhale deeply and feel a bit dizzy.
<es>

@610
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmm...Shortage of oxygen..."
<es>

@611
<en>Then I close my eyes, feeling my consciousness going away. I find myself relaxed.
<es>

@612
<en>Relaxation invites sleepiness.
<es>

@613
<en>With Kazushi's cloth and towel on, I am being in his futon. I feel like being wrapped by him.
<es>

@614
<en>{Ran}\n"Uh...I'm so sleepy..."
<es>

@616
<en>It's so comfortable. I am giving away to the temptation to sleep. I'm falling into a deep sleep.
<es>

@617
<en>{Ran}\n"Ugh..."
<es>

@618
<en>It is very quiet outside, and it stopped raining. This dim room is like a night aquarium.
<es>

@619
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm going, going..."
<es>

@620
<en>I wonder anything good is going to happen when I wake up tomorrow. Thinking that, Ran is gone into a deep sleep.
<es>
