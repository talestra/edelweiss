<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ofcourse you can.\nAnything for you, anytime!"
<es>

@11
<en>I had to say it in a funny way.\nI guess I was afraid of her telling me not to be too personal with her.
<es>

@12
<en>......that's when I realized I'm starting to like her seriously.
<es>

@15
<en>{Mei}\n"I might take it seriously if that's O.K with you."
<es>

@16
<en>She game me back her usual smile.\nI was relieved and at the same time I couldn't help getting greedy.
<es>

@17
<en>I wanna get closer to her.
<es>

@18
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Absolutely!\nYou can call me anytime!\nEven if it's midnight!"
<es>

@21
<en>{Mei}\n"Anytime?\nDoes it include early morning?\nI guess you forgot what time you woke up today."
<es>

@22
<en>Opps!!
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That was a million years ago.\nI'm different now."
<es>

@26
<en>{Mei}\n"You are?\n......thet say boys can change in three days.\nYou are really dependable."
<es>

@27
<en>She gives a smile even for my excuses.\nOutside the room was so beautiful we could only sigh.
<es>

@29
<en>It was getting darker but she is so close to me I could clearly see her. But her exsistence was so vague and in a sense it seemed like we were in fantasy.
<es>

@31
<en>Her beautiful flame is lit by the sun light.\nIt was a heavenly view.
<es>

@32
<en>I couldn't help staring at her.\nI could hear my own heart pounding.
<es>

@33
<en>What is wrong with me?\nI've never felt like this before being with her.
<es>

@34
<en>Is this love what I'm feeling?
<es>

@35
<en>{Mei}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@36
<en>She caught me staring at her.\nI don't know what to say to her.
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm......"
<es>

@38
<en>She's so beautiful, I can't think of anything to say.\nI've always known she's beautiful, but I never knew she's this beautiful.
<es>

@39
<en>I want keep watching her like this......\nMy feelings for her keeps growing.
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Kazushi sighing)
<es>

@41
<en>I couldn't help sighing the moment I realized my feelings for her.
<es>

@42
<en>I truly like this lady.\nNot as a teacher, as a woman.
<es>

@45
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi?\nAre you all right?"
<es>

@46
<en>She looks into me.
<es>

@47
<en>Her attractive eyes are looking into me.
<es>

@50
<en>{Mei}\n"Are you all right?\nAre you feeling sick?\n......"
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm fine."
<es>

@53
<en>I couldn't see her in the eyes.\nI'm too aware of my feelings for her.
<es>

@54
<en>This is great.\nThe person I'm so attracted is right in front of me.
<es>

@57
<en>{Mei}\n"Are you sure you're O.K?"
<es>

@58
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's nothing!\nI'm perfectly fine!"
<es>

@61
<en>{Mei}\n"Did you get heat stroke?\nYour face is all red."
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's actually because of......"
<es>

@63
<en>What should I say?\nShould I tell her my honest feelings for her?\nI don't wanna make a sudden move and get rejected.
<es>

@64
<en>I'm her student.\nShe will use that as an excuse to reject me.\nI should think before I make my moves.
<es>

@65
<en>Maybe I should ask my guys.\nPierre is an expert on these stuff and Appo- has a girlfriend.
<es>

@66
<en>That's a good idea. Eventhough Ms, Ibuki is one million times more beautiful then Hu-sen, Appo- would still give a good advice from his experience.
<es>

@67
<en>At least it would be much better then making my moves without any plans.
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I like you!"
<es>

@72
<en>{Mei}\n"What?"
<es>

@73
<en>{Kazushi}\n(What did I do!?)
<es>

@74
<en>I surprised myself.\nI did exactly opposite of what I was thinking!!
<es>

@75
<en>How stupid of me to say that out of blue!
<es>

@76
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi?\nI don't think I heard you well......"
<es>

@77
<en>I'm sure it's more like she couldn't understand me rather than she couldn't hear me well.
<es>

@78
<en>Maybe I can still fool this situation?\nI can still take back my words......\nHere it goes......
<es>

@80
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm in love with you!\nPlease go out with me!!"
<es>

@83
<en>Opps!\nI said it again!\nI said it as clear as it could be!
<es>

@84
<en>{Mei}\n"......you love me?"
<es>

@85
<en>She gets paniked as she understood what I said.\nThis might be a good sign.\nThe fact she's in panic.
<es>

@88
<en>{Mei}\n"......ummm"
<es>

@89
<en>But soon, she disguised herself with a calm smile.
<es>

@92
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, I'm flattered.\nI like you, too."
<es>

@93
<en>It was exactly how a teacher should respond to a student in this kind of a situation.\nBut that's not what I want.
<es>

@94
<en>I don't want her to pull us back to the reality.
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm serious."
<es>

@98
<en>It gets so much easier on the second time.
<es>

@99
<en>She probably never looked at me the same way as I look at her.\nI got nothing to lose anyways.
<es>

@102
<en>{Mei}\n"You are serious......\nyou mean you wanna be in a relationship with me?"
<es>

@103
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ofcourse I am.\nThat's what I meant."
<es>

@106
<en>{Mei}\n"I see......\nbut you are my student."
<es>

@107
<en>I didn't want to hear that popular answer.\nDoes it matter that much?
<es>

@108
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am serious.\nI love you as a woman."
<es>

@109
<en>This time, I looked into her eyes and said it.\nShe let out a big sigh.
<es>

@112
<en>{Mei}\n"You make it sound so easy."
<es>

@113
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It is easy.\nAll there is left is to tell me how you feel about me."
<es>

@116
<en>{Mei}\n"How I feel about you......"
<es>

@117
<en>She tries to speak,\nbut words don't come out from her mouth.
<es>

@120
<en>{Mei}\n"......what about age difference?\nI am older than you......"
<es>

@121
<en>{Mei}\n"There are so many pretty girls around your own age.\nWhy me?"
<es>

@122
<en>Instead of answering my question,\nshe threw back a question to me.
<es>

@123
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's because I'm in love with you.\nIf you love someone, age doesmn't matter, does it?"
<es>

@126
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't know......"
<es>

@127
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ofcourse it doesn't.\nThere are plenty of couples whose ages are more apart than ours."
<es>

@128
<en>{Mei}\n"I know that......\nbut it's not just about age difference......\nit's also about who we are."
<es>

@129
<en>She looks at me as if she needs an advice from me.
<es>

@132
<en>{Mei}\n"I like you, too.\nIsn't it good enough?"
<es>

@133
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You just like me as a student.\nThat's not what I want.\nI want to be your number one."
<es>

@136
<en>{Mei}\n"My number one......"
<es>

@137
<en>Her eyes are wondering around looking through the windows.\nThe sky has turned red from the sunset.
<es>

@138
<en>She looks as innocent as a tiny girl.
<es>

@139
<en>She shook her head as if she's reached a conclusion.
<es>

@142
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sorry.\nI don't think I can do that."
<es>

@143
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......"
<es>

@144
<en>It was as if I got hit on my head really hard.\nShe appologized to me.\n......does this mean I got rejected?
<es>

@145
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......can't do it?\nIs it because I'm just a boy who happened to be your student......?"
<es>

@148
<en>{Mei}\n"No, it's not.\nIt's not you. I just can't figure out ......"
<es>

@149
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can't figure out......?"
<es>

@152
<en>{Mei}\n"I've never felt the feeling of 'love' before."
<es>

@153
<en>She continues to appologize.\nShe's never felt 'love' before......
<es>

@154
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......you never fell in love before?"
<es>

@155
<en>She shook her head slowly.
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Never?"
<es>

@159
<en>{Mei}\n"I can't remember."
<es>

@160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can't remember?"
<es>

@161
<en>What does she mean she can't remember?
<es>

@162
<en>......oh yeah......
<es>

@165
<en>{Mei}\n"As far as I remember, I've never fell in love with anyone after start teaching here."
<es>

@166
<en>I can understand that. There is no young man in this island.
<es>

@167
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How about before you start teaching......?"
<es>

@168
<en>She is a graduate here.\nAfter graduating, she went out from this island for a college.
<es>

@169
<en>College is where people find love.\n--and it's exactly where her memory is missing......
<es>

@170
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I remember you telling me you lost your memory of the past."
<es>

@171
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes......"
<es>

@172
<en>That's right.\nShe doesn't remember anything of the time before she starts teaching in this island.
<es>

@175
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't remember of me in a relationship nor even falling in love with somebody. I don't remember anything."
<es>

@176
<en>{Mei}\n"Maybe that is reason.\nThe reason I can't understand what it's like to love somebody......"
<es>

@177
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's how you feel......?"
<es>

@178
<en>I feel like being cheated.\nOne doesn't understand what it's like to love somebody to love somebody.
<es>

@181
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sorry.\nI can't be in a special relationship with you."
<es>

@182
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah......"
<es>

@183
<en>Same result in the end.\nI fell on the floor.
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......I need to get out of this island......\nI'm gonna be out for a long trio......"
<es>

@187
<en>{Mei}\n"......before you leave, make sure you turn in the permission to leave this island, O.K? You need to infrom the office where you are going."
<es>

@188
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll be heading north......I lost meaning of living......"
<es>

@191
<en>{Mei}\n"......don't be so exaggerated."
<es>

@192
<en>She sounds like she's shocked by my childish behavior.\nShe sounds like as if it's not a big deal.\nMaybe she realy doesn't understand what love is.
<es>

@195
<en>{Mei}\n"Do you really have to be so depressed?\nYou will find someone else very soon."
<es>

@196
<en>Now I'm convinced.\nShe doesn't understand it at all.
<es>

@197
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It has to be you.\nThere is no one else out there to replace you."
<es>

@200
<en>{Mei}\n"You are over reacting."
<es>

@201
<en>I don't think she will ever get it.\nThere is no hope for her to understand this.
<es>

@202
<en>Since she can't understand how it's like to be in love, none of what I said would reach her heart.
<es>

@203
<en>Would I get rejected even without a good reason?
<es>

@204
<en>I'm not going to let this happen.\nI'm not going to end my summer this way.
<es>

@205
<en>Because my summer's just started.
<es>

@206
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not going to give up."
<es>

@209
<en>I stood up with pride. I'm standing in front of her face to face. She's looking back at me as if she's looking at something curious.
<es>

@210
<en>{Mei}\n"Didn't you hear me?\nI can't have a special relationship with you."
<es>

@211
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that because I'm your student?"
<es>

@214
<en>{Mei}\n"That is right.\nI have to treat every single one of my students equally."
<es>

@215
<en>{Mei}\n"Including you."
<es>

@216
<en>She can't go out with me because I'm her student.--it means there is still hope!\nI'll take it that way!
<es>

@217
<en>It's not like she doesn't want me!
<es>

@218
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I have an idea.\nCan you judge me by looking at me as a man instead of your student at least for during summer break?"
<es>

@221
<en>{Mei}\n"During summer break?"
<es>

@222
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, just for during summer break.\nI take my time off from being a student and you take your time off from being my teacher."
<es>

@223
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It is summer break!"
<es>

@226
<en>{Mei}\n"Because it is summer break?"
<es>

@227
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's a break. Why don't we take time off from being what we were!"
<es>

@230
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't know......"
<es>

@231
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You have to take time off when you are in vacation!"
<es>

@234
<en>{Mei}\n"......I see your point......"
<es>

@235
<en>She is thinking.\nI'm almost there!
<es>

@236
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please! Just for the summer break!\nIf I fail to change your mind at the end of the summer break, I promise I'll go back to being your student!"
<es>

@237
<en>I am desperate.\nI need to change the conclusion she once had.\nThat will be game over.
<es>

@238
<en>I don't want it to be end. My summer has just started. I want to make her at least understand how I feel toward her.
<es>

@239
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please!!\nI promise I'll study, too!"
<es>

@240
<en>I'm starting to sound like a spoiled child.\nBut I don't care.\nAt this point, I will do whatever it takes.
<es>

@241
<en>I keep staring at her with my soul.\nShe looks down.
<es>

@244
<en>{Mei}\n(Ms, Ibuki burst into laughter)
<es>

@245
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@246
<en>She's looking down shaking her shoulder.\nShe's having trouble holding the laughter.
<es>

@247
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you laughing?\nHow could you?"
<es>

@248
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sorry......\nyou are so desperate and so cute."
<es>

@249
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Cute......"
<es>

@250
<en>It's delicate to judge.\nI wish she'd said I looked cool. Then it was much easier to judge how she felt.
<es>

@253
<en>{Mei}\n"Let's see......"
<es>

@254
<en>She's letting out a big sigh.\nStill smiling.
<es>

@257
<en>{Mei}\n"All right.\nOnly for this summer break time, O.K?"
<es>

@258
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What......?"
<es>

@259
<en>It happened so fast I couldn't believe it.
<es>

@260
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's fine with you?"
<es>

@261
<en>{Mei}\n"I didn't agree to go out with you.\nI agreed to take time off from being your teacher."
<es>

@262
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's all I'm asking!!\nDuring the summer break, we are a man and a woman!"
<es>

@265
<en>{Mei}\n"That quite doesn't sound like what I agreed on.\nI feel more like you are a younger friend who happens to be my neighbor."
<es>

@266
<en>{Kazushi}\n"At this point, whatever is fine!"
<es>

@267
<en>I came back to this far from pretty much getting rejected.\nI should be happy with the situation I got right now.
<es>

@268
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yessssss!!"
<es>

@271
<en>{Mei}\n"You really are over reacting."
<es>

@272
<en>She smiles at me like a little girl.\nI want this her smile all to myself.
<es>

@273
<en>I know it's selfish of me to think that way, but that's my honest feeling.
<es>

@274
<en>It's been a long time since I was in love.\nI have a feeling this summer is going to be one hot summer.
<es>
