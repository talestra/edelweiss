<en>{Kazushi}\n"No problem. I'll come flying any time you need me!"
<es>

@11
<en>I said, a bit jokingly. I was afraid of what would happen if she suddenly rejected me.\nHuh? Why am I afraid?
<es>

@12
<en>......that's when I realized I was seriously starting to like her.
<es>

@15
<en>{Mei}\n"Hee-hee. Be careful, I may take that offer seriously."
<es>

@16
<en>She flashed her usual smile back at me. I was relieved, but at the same time I couldn't help being greedy.
<es>

@17
<en>I wanted to get closer to her.
<es>

@18
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Absolutely!\nYou can call me anytime!\nEven if it's midnight!"
<es>

@21
<en>{Mei}\n"Any time?\nDoes that include early morning? I'm guessing you forgot what time you woke up this afternoon."
<es>

@22
<en>...oops!
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That was the past me. Forget the past, I've already turned over a new leaf."
<es>

@26
<en>{Mei}\n"You have? Give a man three days... or so it goes, I guess. You boys are so dependable."
<es>

@28
<en>Even as I gave her desperate excuses, she gave me a gentle smile that glowed madder red in the light of sunset. I could almost sigh at this twilight scene which looked right out of a painting.
<es>

@29
<en>As the faint light faded in the distance, hardly reaching us, I could barely make her out at this distance. Her figure was growing vague, projected before me like a wondrous dream.
<es>

@31
<en>Her beautiful silhouette was outlined by the setting sun, bringing out a mysterious aspect to her figure. The scene made my heart ache.
<es>

@32
<en>She looked so beautiful I didn't know what to do. I couldn't take my eyes off her. My heart was pounding.
<es>

@33
<en>What's wrong with me? I've never felt like this with her before.
<es>

@34
<en>Is what I'm feeling love?
<es>

@35
<en>{Mei}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@36
<en>She noticed how I kept staring at her, and looked at me curiously with a gentle smile. I froze, not knowing what to say to her.
<es>

@37
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm......"
<es>

@38
<en>She truly looked absolutely beautiful, and I was at a loss for words. I knew she was beautiful, but had she always been this otherworldly?
<es>

@39
<en>My longing to stay here watching her like this... grew stronger and stronger.
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n*Sigh*
<es>

@41
<en>I caught myself sighing. I realized my feelings for her were growing ever stronger and out of my control.
<es>

@42
<en>I really like this lady. Not just as a teacher, but as a woman.
<es>

@45
<en>{Mei}\n"Haruma-kun?\nAre you all right?"
<es>

@46
<en>She gazed at me.
<es>

@47
<en>Her attractive eyes were looking into me.
<es>

@50
<en>{Mei}\n"Are you all right? Do you feel sluggish? It's not heatstroke, is it..."
<es>

@51
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm fine."
<es>

@53
<en>I averted my eyes. Once I found these feelings, I couldn't look her in the eye.
<es>

@54
<en>After all, this was amazing. The person I loved was right before my eyes. I could reach out and touch her.
<es>

@57
<en>{Mei}\n"Are you sure you're OK? You're acting strange?"
<es>

@58
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's nothing!\nI'm perfectly fine!"
<es>

@61
<en>{Mei}\n"Did you get heat stroke? Your face is all red."
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's actually because of......"
<es>

@63
<en>What should I say? Should I tell her how I feel? No, if I said that all of a sudden, it's quite likely she'd reject me.
<es>

@65
<en>After all, she's a teacher and I'm her student. I have no doubt she'll turn me down on those grounds, and it'll be over. I need to think this over carefully and plan my approach.
<es>

@67
<en>Maybe I should ask the guys. Pierre's an expert on these sorts of things, and Appo has a girlfriend.
<es>

@68
<en>That's a good idea. Even though Mei-sensei's a million times more beautiful than her, Fuusen is still a girl. As a man with experience, I'm sure he'll have good advice.
<es>

@69
<en>It'll be at least a little better than going in without a plan and failing. Alright, I'll do that.
<es>

@71
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I like you!"
<es>

@74
<en>{Mei}\n"What?"
<es>

@75
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Shit! What did I just do!?)
<es>

@76
<en>I surprised myself. How did I manage to do the exact opposite of what I was planning?!
<es>

@77
<en>How stupid of me to say that out of the blue!
<es>

@78
<en>{Mei}\n"Haruma-kun? I don't think I heard you correctly..."
<es>

@79
<en>Sensei didn't hide her confusion when she asked me as I scratched at my head. I thought she didn't understand more than didn't hear.
<es>

@80
<en>Maybe I can still cover things up and fix this situation?\nI can ignore what I said earlier...\nHere goes...
<es>

@82
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm in love with you! Please go out with me!!"
<es>

@85
<en>Oops! I did it again! I said it as clear as clear could be.
<es>

@86
<en>{Mei}\n"Huh? ...y-you love... me?"
<es>

@87
<en>Mei-sensei became panicked as the weight of what I said sank in. This might be a good sign - the fact that she doesn't know how to react.
<es>

@90
<en>{Mei}\n"......Ah, umm... ahem."
<es>

@91
<en>But soon, she disguised herself with a calm smile.
<es>

@94
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, I'm flattered. I like you, too."
<es>

@95
<en>It was exactly how a teacher should respond to her student in this kind of situation, but it wasn't what I wanted to hear.
<es>

@96
<en>Even if it was spur of the moment, now that I'd confessed I didn't want her to pull us back to being teacher and student.
<es>

@97
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm serious. I love you, Mei-sensei."
<es>

@100
<en>Once I'd already confessed, I could feel my courage welling up. There was no turning back for me now.
<es>

@101
<en>I knew she'd probably never thought of me in this way before. I was starting from zero. I had nothing to lose.
<es>

@104
<en>{Mei}\n"You are serious......\nYou mean you want to be in a relationship with me?"
<es>

@105
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course I am. That's what I meant, or I wouldn't have said it again."
<es>

@108
<en>{Mei}\n"I see. That's true...\nBut you're my student."
<es>

@109
<en>I didn't want to hear that cliched answer.\nDoes it really matter that much?
<es>

@110
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am serious. I love you as a woman."
<es>

@111
<en>I looked her in the eyes and said it once more. She blinked in confusion, and then let out a big sigh.
<es>

@114
<en>{Mei}\n"You make it sound so easy."
<es>

@115
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It is easy. I love you. All that's left is for you to say how you feel about me."
<es>

@118
<en>{Mei}\n"How I feel about you......"
<es>

@119
<en>She tried to speak, but the words wouldn't come from her mouth.
<es>

@122
<en>{Mei}\n"...what about the age difference? I'm a lot older than you are."
<es>

@123
<en>{Mei}\n"There are so many pretty girls here that are your age. Why me?"
<es>

@124
<en>Instead of answering my question, she threw back a question to me. But my answer was already set.
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's because I'm in love with you. If you love someone, age doesn't matter, does it?"
<es>

@128
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't know......"
<es>

@129
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course it doesn't. There are plenty of couples whose ages are far more distant than ours."
<es>

@130
<en>{Mei}\n"I know that...... But it's not just about age difference. I have my position as your teacher to consider."
<es>

@131
<en>She looked at me as if she needed me to tell her what to say.
<es>

@134
<en>{Mei}\n"I like you too. Isn't that good enough?"
<es>

@135
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You only like me as a student. That's not what I want. I want to be the number one guy for you."
<es>

@138
<en>{Mei}\n"My number one......"
<es>

@139
<en>Her eyes were wandering around, staring out through the windows. The sky was a blazing vermillion from the sunset.
<es>

@140
<en>As she gazed at that blazing sky, her silhouette looked like a little girl who had yet to understand the world, leaving a wondrous impression.
<es>

@141
<en>She furrowed her brows and shook her head sullenly.
<es>

@144
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sorry.\nI don't think I can do that."
<es>

@145
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......"
<es>

@146
<en>It hit me harder than Yagami-sensei's toughest blows.\nMei-sensei just apologized to me.\nDoes this mean I've been rejected?
<es>

@147
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...you can't do it? I know we've only just met, and that I'm your student, and I may be an undependable kid, but..."
<es>

@150
<en>{Mei}\n"No, it's not.\nIt's not you. I just can't figure out......"
<es>

@151
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can't figure out......?"
<es>

@154
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't think I've ever once felt 'love' before."
<es>

@155
<en>She continued apologizing.\nShe's never felt love before...
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...you've never been in love before?"
<es>

@157
<en>She shook her head slowly.
<es>

@158
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Never?"
<es>

@161
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't know."
<es>

@162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't know?"
<es>

@163
<en>I didn't expect that. What does she mean she doesn't know?
<es>

@164
<en>......oh yeah......
<es>

@167
<en>{Mei}\n"At the very least, I've never felt love since I became a teacher here. It was an all girls school, and there weren't any young men on the island either."
<es>

@168
<en>I could understand that. The only other men here were in their 40s or 50s.
<es>

@169
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But before you started teaching..."
<es>

@170
<en>She graduated from Eiden Academy. After that, she had to go to college for her teacher's license. So she had to have left this island.
<es>

@171
<en>Even if she didn't live on campus, lots of people meet up in college. Yet to Mei-sensei that time...
<es>

@172
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...has all been forgotten, right?"
<es>

@173
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes......"
<es>

@174
<en>That's right. She doesn't remember anything of the time from before she started teaching on this island.
<es>

@177
<en>{Mei}\n"I don't remember anything about whether or not I've been in a relationship or ever fallen in love with somebody. I don't remember anything."
<es>

@178
<en>{Mei}\n"Maybe that's why. Maybe that's the reason why I can't understand what it's like to be in love with somebody."
<es>

@179
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's how you feel......?"
<es>

@180
<en>I felt like I'd been cheated. Is love even something you have to understand?
<es>

@183
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sorry. I can't be in a special relationship with you."
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah......"
<es>

@185
<en>The result was the same: I was rejected in no time. *orz*
<es>

@186
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm finished... I'm going on a journey...... with a Seishun 18 ticket..."
<es>

@189
<en>{Mei}\n"Oh, you still need to file for permission to go on a long excursion, even though it's summer break. You'll also need to give them a destination and a reason."
<es>

@190
<en>{Kazushi}\n"North...... Lost the will to live after having my heart broken..."
<es>

@193
<en>{Mei}\n"The will to live? ...Stop being so dramatic."
<es>

@194
<en>She sounded shocked by my childish behavior.\nShe sounded like this wasn't a big deal.\nMaybe she really didn't understand what love was.
<es>

@197
<en>{Mei}\n"Do you really have to be so depressed? There are plenty of pretty young girls here. I'm sure you'll find someone else very soon."
<es>

@198
<en>Now I'm convinced.\nShe doesn't understand it at all.
<es>

@199
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It can't be anyone else. It has to be you. There is no one else out there to replace you."
<es>

@202
<en>{Mei}\n"Now you're overreacting."
<es>

@203
<en>I don't think she'll ever get it. There's no hope that she'll understand how I feel.
<es>

@204
<en>Since she can't understand (or remember) how it feels to be in love, she can't understand how serious my confession is.
<es>

@205
<en>Am I going to be rejected without even a decent reason?
<es>

@206
<en>I'm not going to let this happen. I'm not going to end my summer this way.
<es>

@207
<en>Because my summer's just started.
<es>

@208
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not going to give up."
<es>

@211
<en>I stood up with pride and renewed vigor. I stood off with her, face to face. She looked back at me as though I were a curious creature in the zoo.
<es>

@212
<en>{Mei}\n"Didn't you hear me?\nI can't have a special relationship with you."
<es>

@213
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that because I'm your student?"
<es>

@216
<en>{Mei}\n"That's right. I have to treat all of my students equally."
<es>

@217
<en>{Mei}\n"Including you."
<es>

@218
<en>She can't go out with me because I'm her student. That means there's still hope! ...at least that's the way I'll have to take it.
<es>

@219
<en>It's not like she doesn't want me!
<es>

@220
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then I have an idea. For the duration of summer break alone, can you look at me as a man instead of your student, and then decide?"
<es>

@223
<en>{Mei}\n"Just for summer break?"
<es>

@224
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, just for the summer break. I'm taking my time off from being a student, so why don't you take time off from being a teacher too?"
<es>

@225
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You know, summer break."
<es>

@228
<en>{Mei}\n"Because it's summer break?"
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's summer break, so take a break from being a teacher!"
<es>

@232
<en>{Mei}\n"But just because it's summer break doesn't..."
<es>

@233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You have to take time off from who you are when you're on vacation!"
<es>

@236
<en>{Mei}\n"Yes...... I see your point......"
<es>

@237
<en>She's thinking it over. I'm almost there!
<es>

@238
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please! Just for the summer break! If I fail to change your mind at the end of the summer break, I promise I'll go back to being your student!"
<es>

@239
<en>I'm beyond desperate. I need to change the conclusion she's reached - that would mean game over.
<es>

@240
<en>I don't want to hit a bad end. My summer's just started, and I want to make her at least understand how I feel towards her.
<es>

@241
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please!! I promise I'll study, too!"
<es>

@242
<en>I'm starting to sound like a spoiled child, but I don't care. At this point, I'll do whatever it takes.
<es>

@243
<en>I keep staring at her with all my heart. She finally lowered her long eyelashes.
<es>

@246
<en>{Mei}\n"Pfft..."
<es>

@247
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@248
<en>Her whole body was shaking as she kept looking down. She was having trouble containing her laughter.
<es>

@249
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you laughing?\nHow could you?"
<es>

@250
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm sorry...\nYou just sounded so desperate. It was cute."
<es>

@251
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Cute......"
<es>

@252
<en>It was tough to work that one out. Cool would've been better.
<es>

@255
<en>{Mei}\n"Let's see......"
<es>

@256
<en>She's letting out a big sigh.\nStill smiling.
<es>

@259
<en>{Mei}\n"Well, all right. But only for summer break. That means only until the end of summer break, OK?"
<es>

@260
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What......?"
<es>

@261
<en>It happened so fast I couldn't believe it.
<es>

@262
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's fine with you?"
<es>

@263
<en>{Mei}\n"I'm not agreeing go out with you. I'm only agreeing to take time off from being your teacher."
<es>

@264
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's all I'm asking!! For the duration of summer break, we are a man and a woman!"
<es>

@267
<en>{Mei}\n"That quite doesn't sound like what I'm agreeing to. I feel more like you're a younger friend who happens to be my neighbor."
<es>

@268
<en>{Kazushi}\n"At this point, anything's fine!"
<es>

@269
<en>I made it back this far from being flat out rejected. I should be happy with the situation I'm in right now. My head's still attached by a thread!
<es>

@270
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yessssss!!"
<es>

@273
<en>{Mei}\n"You really are overreacting."
<es>

@274
<en>She smiled at me like a little girl. I wanted to have that smile all to myself.
<es>

@275
<en>I know it was selfish of me to think that way, but that was my honest feeling.
<es>

@276
<en>It's been a long time since I last found myself in love.\nI have a feeling this summer is going to be a hot one.
<es>
