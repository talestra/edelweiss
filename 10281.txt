<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where are we......?"
<es>

@8
<en>I was actually still in my dream.\nI woke up in my dream.
<es>

@9
<en>I've experienced this before when I was still little.\nFirst thing I did was to observe what was around me.
<es>

@10
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I've been to this flower garden before."
<es>

@11
<en>I knew exactly where I was in my dream.\nIt's principal's flower garden.\nI'm still inside the island even in my dream.
<es>

@12
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I should've brought Haruka with me."
<es>

@13
<en>I thought about the better situation as if I'm creating someone else's dream.\nAnd it's partially true.
<es>

@14
<en>I am the main character with the third person point of view in this dream. And this is not rare when you have a dream with yourself in it.
<es>

@16
<en>(Sound of foot steps)
<es>

@17
<en>I heard someone getting closer to me.
<es>

@21
<en>{Haruka}\n"Did you wait long for me, Teacher?"
<es>

@22
<en>It's Haruka.\nI thought about having her in my dream just a few seconds ago.
<es>

@23
<en>It's my kind of a dream.\nMy wish comes true very easily.\nBut why did she call me "teacher"?
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not at all. I just got here, too."
<es>

@25
<en>I responded.\nI couldn't recognize my own voice, because it's so much lower than it actually is in real life.
<es>

@26
<en>It sounded like I got older by 10, 20 years.
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where have you been?"
<es>

@28
<en>{Haruka}\n"I went to the top of this mountain to see a nice view.\nYou should've come with me."
<es>

@29
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can take me there next time.\nI'm sure we have a lots of time."
<es>

@32
<en>She gave me a big smile.
<es>

@33
<en>{Haruka}\n"Yes. That's true."
<es>

@34
<en>She came next to me and took a good look of what's around us.
<es>

@37
<en>{Haruka}\n"This place is truly magnificent.\nAnd I'm honored to work with you here."
<es>

@38
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, that's what I needed to say to you.\nIt was fortunate for me that this land belongs to your family."
<es>

@39
<en>{Kazushi}\n"And I can't appreciate enough for inviting me over to this island."
<es>

@40
<en>I bowed to Haruka. It seems like I'm truly appreciating for what's happening. I also feel something more than just an appreciation in my heart.
<es>

@43
<en>{Haruka}\n"You don't have to bow......\nplease raise your head."
<es>

@44
<en>Haruka blushes her cheek.\nIt is sure Haruka, but something is different.
<es>

@45
<en>I don't know what makes me think she is different.
<es>

@46
<en>{Kazushi}\n"When I think about what's coming up in my future here, I can't help getting excited like a child and I'm embarrassed sometimes."
<es>

@49
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's O.K\nbesides, you are still young."
<es>

@50
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not as young as you think I am.\nAnd that's why I'm going to devote myself into reserching my studies here."
<es>

@51
<en>I have no idea what have we been talking to each other.
<es>

@52
<en>It seems like both Haruka and I have different roles in this dream.\nAnd I haven't figured out anything yet.
<es>

@53
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm thinking about building our institute on top of that mountain over there."
<es>

@54
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That would be wonderful."
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But......\nin that case, we would be needing a huge fund, wouldn't we?"
<es>

@56
<en>{Haruka}\n"Please let me worry about that.\nI want you to just focus on your project."
<es>

@57
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I hope I'm not bringing you trouble. I should not take an advantage of your offer."
<es>

@60
<en>{Haruka}\n"Please let me be a part of it.\nI want to help you as much as I can."
<es>

@63
<en>{Haruka}\n"And you are not bringing me any trouble.\nI'm thinking about establishing a school next to your institute."
<es>

@64
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's a wonderful idea.\nI'm sure you will raise many good successors from this island."
<es>

@65
<en>{Haruka}\n"I hope so, too.\nAnd I need your help to achieve it."
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My commitment is yours.\nI promise you I'll do my best."
<es>

@69
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'll follow your lead."
<es>

@70
<en>We shook hands.
<es>

@71
<en>It was much more than just a shake hand.
<es>

@72
<en>I like her very much.\nAnd she likes me, too.
<es>

@73
<en>We are lovers even in a dream.\nI'm so glad.
<es>

@76
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hey, Kazushi."
<es>

@77
<en>?\nAll of a sudden, she calls me like how she'd always call me.
<es>

@78
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi......hey...Kazushi..."
<es>

@79
<en>......something is wrong.
<es>

@84
<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi."
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"?......where am I ......?"
<es>

@86
<en>I finally truly woke up.
<es>

@91
<en>{Haruka}\n"Are you up?\nGood morning."
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good morning."
<es>

@93
<en>The first thing I saw today was Haruka's face. It's going to be a good day.
<es>

@94
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What time is it?"
<es>

@95
<en>I got up.\nA blanket fell off from my body.
<es>

@98
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ah!?"
<es>

@99
<en>She looked away.\nI was naked.
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry!"
<es>

@101
<en>I'm having a hard on, too.
<es>

@104
<en>{Haruka}\n"You are full of energy from a morning."
<es>

@105
<en>She is still looking away.\nI think she saw everything.
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm indeed full of energy, but it gets like this everymorning."
<es>

@107
<en>It's so embarrassing to explain to her how it is for guys every morning. She seemed quite impressed listening to my explanation.
<es>

@110
<en>{Haruka}\n"I think you should get some clothes on."
<es>

@111
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's true.\n......I wonder where I put my......"
<es>

@113
<en>The clothes from last night was neatly folded right by the bed.\nHaruka must did it for me.
<es>

@114
<en>A small thing like this touches my heart.
<es>

@115
<en>I dressed up in the clothes she folded for me feeling I'm in heaven.
<es>

@116
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks for waiting."
<es>

@119
<en>She finally turned around to see me.\nI'm still embarrassed to see straight in her eyes.\nIt all happened just yesterday so I can't help it.
<es>

@120
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm......hey."
<es>

@121
<en>I noticed something different.\nIt seems like she was using a fire pot.
<es>

@122
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Were you working on alchemy?"
<es>

@125
<en>{Haruka}\n"Umm......I kinda made this."
<es>

@126
<en>She showed me some kind of liquid.
<es>

@127
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You made that?"
<es>

@128
<en>{Haruka}\n"Uh huh."
<es>

@129
<en>She nods her head.\nAfter a series of failure, she must have finally come up with something successful.
<es>

@132
<en>{Haruka}\n"When I woke up this morning, I felt so fresh.\nAnd I thought maybe I can do it this time......"
<es>

@133
<en>So she tried it......and it happened.\nWhen you get out from a slump, it's usually very simple.
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So what did you make?"
<es>

@137
<en>{Haruka}\n"This one,\nI'm very confident."
<es>

@138
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......?"
<es>

@139
<en>Haruka shows me a smile with full of confidence.
<es>

@145
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh! My! God!!!!!!"
<es>

@146
<en>Wind is passing by us.\nI mean, we are the wind.
<es>

@147
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This is unbelievable!\nWe are truly flying!"
<es>

@148
<en>We are flying on a desk.\nWe failed last time with a pair of wings. Today, we are flying on a non-flying object.
<es>

@149
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Isn't this more like a magic than alchemy!?"
<es>

@150
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't know!\nOne thing I know is that I feel like I can do anything now!"
<es>

@151
<en>She gained back all the confidence she lost.\nHer smile tells me that she is full of confidence.
<es>

@152
<en>{Haruka}\n"This is all because of you!"
<es>

@153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!?\nWhy!?"
<es>

@154
<en>{Haruka}\n"I feel your love has made me stronger!\nWhatever I failed to do in the past, I feel like I can do it now!"
<es>

@155
<en>{Haruka}\n"I feel like I was given a new life!"
<es>

@156
<en>Watching her regained fresh strength makes me stronger, too.
<es>

@157
<en>Her smile is all I need.\nShe makes me feel that way.
<es>

@158
<en>{Haruka}\n"You should try too!"
<es>

@159
<en>She backs up and yields her position to me.
<es>

@160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do I supposed to do......?"
<es>

@161
<en>I don't know how to operate this.\nThere is no handle or a brake.
<es>

@162
<en>{Haruka}\n"Where do you want to go?\nWe can go anywhere we want!"
<es>

@163
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The place I like......\nlet's see......"
<es>

@164
<en>I looked up to the sky.\nSun is shining and so are white clouds.
<es>

@165
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Even higher......"
<es>

@166
<en>(Flying desk accelerates)
<es>

@167
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Opps!!"
<es>

@168
<en>The desk boosted up in a hurry.\nI guess all I have to do is to think where I wanna go.
<es>

@169
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This thing is amazing!"
<es>

@170
<en>{Haruka}\n"I told you, you will love alchemy!!"
<es>

@171
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's unbelievable!!"
<es>

@172
<en>I felt like we could go to the end of the world.
<es>

@173
<en>With Haruka, I feel like I can even go to the end of the world.
<es>

@174
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Should we just get away from it all?!!"
<es>

@175
<en>She's always wanted to go out from this island one day.\nMaybe I can make her dream come true today.
<es>

@176
<en>{Haruka}\n"You think we can?"
<es>

@177
<en>She suddenly looks worried.\nShe must feel anxiety going out from this island.
<es>

@178
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry! I'll be with you!"
<es>

@179
<en>I hold her close.
<es>

@180
<en>{Haruka}\n"......that's right.\nI'm not scared as long as you are with me."
<es>

@181
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right! We will keep going straight.\nWe will even go beyound the horizon......"
<es>

@182
<en>The desk accelerated for a second before it dropped its speed.
<es>

@183
<en>(The flying desk decelerates)
<es>

@184
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Opps!?"
<es>

@185
<en>It's slowing down drasticly.\nWe are going down.
<es>

@186
<en>{Haruka}\n"Maybe we are not supposed to be flying out this far!\nWe need to make a u-turn!!"
<es>

@187
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We are going back!?"
<es>

@188
<en>We made a quick u-turn.\nBy the time the desk regained its speed, we were about to hit the surface of the ocean.
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, it gained back its speed."
<es>

@190
<en>{Haruka}\n"I see what just happened."
<es>

@191
<en>She seems to have found out something and looks all depressed.
<es>

@192
<en>{Haruka}\n"This desk probably receives energy from the island and use it as fuel to fly."
<es>

@194
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah, I never thought about this desk not carrying any fuel tanks. That was stupid of us to think we could fly forever without fuel."
<es>

@196
<en>Now that would be a magic, not alchemy.
<es>

@197
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh, well."
<es>

@198
<en>She was somewhat dry about this.
<es>

@199
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't seem so depressed."
<es>

@200
<en>{Haruka}\n"I know, but I don't know why.\nI feel like even if I can't achieve it today, I can achieve it in the future."
<es>

@201
<en>{Haruka}\n"We've come this far today.\nI definitely feel something about me is different from yesterday."
<es>

@202
<en>{Haruka}\n"And I have you."
<es>

@203
<en>She gives me a big smile.\nIt makes me blushed.
<es>

@204
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You are right.\nWe have plenty time."
<es>

@205
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's right.\nThere are so many things I left unachieved even inside this island."
<es>

@206
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We still have a lot to go."
<es>

@207
<en>We are still on the starting line.\nThere is no need for us to hurry.
<es>

@208
<en>{Haruka}\n"Let's just take our time to enjoy this sky walking for today!"
<es>

@217
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hey guys!\nEat as much as you want, O.K?!!"
<es>

@218
<en>Haruka gained her energy back completely.\nToday, she happened to be in charge of meals.
<es>

@223
<en>{Appo-}\n"What is this red rice?"
<es>

@229
<en>{Daigo}\n"You don't know people eat red rice when there is something to celebrate in our culture?"
<es>

@230
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......?"
<es>

@231
<en>Something to celebrate......there was.
<es>

@236
<en>{Pierre}\n"Is this about soomeone here turned to a woman from a girl?"
<es>

@239
<en>Pierre says a joke girls would get disgusted as usual.
<es>

@240
<en>Only this time, he guessed it, right......
<es>

@243
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ou, ou......it still hurts......"
<es>

@244
<en>Haruka is giving a very obvious hint.
<es>

@249
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Congratulations, Kazushi."
<es>

@250
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? I don't know what you're talking about."
<es>

@251
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Com'on. You don't have to hide anything from us.\nRight, baby?"
<es>

@256
<en>{Appo-}\n"Kazushi, you finally became a man......\nI can't believe it's with Haruka......"
<es>

@257
<en>Is he watching Haruka and getting all turned on?
<es>

@258
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Baby, you look like you have extra energy you need to get rid of.\nCome see me tonight."
<es>

@261
<en>{Appo-}\n"Yes............"
<es>

@262
<en>Looks like he will be working hard till late night tonight.
<es>

@265
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well......"
<es>

@266
<en>It seems like Haruka's red rice has informed about us to a lots of people around us.
<es>

@270
<en>{Sakura}\n"My innocent Haruka is gone......"
<es>

@276
<en>{Rin}\n"I see.\nHaruka became a woman.\nI have to ask her how it was later on."
<es>

@277
<en>I'm not so sure if it's a good thing that everyone knows about us now.
<es>

@282
<en>{Haruka}\n"There are still plenty left.\nDon't you hesitate to ask for a refill, because we are celebrating!"
<es>

@283
<en>If it makes Haruka happy, it's all right with me.
<es>

@287
<en>{Mei}\n"Kazushi, you know you need to come see me at student counselling room."
<es>

@288
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh no......"
<es>

@289
<en>I guess it wasn't all right.
<es>

@295
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes!!"
<es>

@296
<en>It seems like I'm getting excited.\nIt's that dream again.
<es>

@297
<en>It's so rare to see a dream continued from the previous dream.
<es>

@300
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's been very successful so far.\nWe've been able to shorten procedures, too."
<es>

@301
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This flower must be the secret."
<es>

@302
<en>It's the white flower.\nThe white flower blooming on the day I first met Haruka.
<es>

@303
<en>{Haruka}\n"I wonder what kind of flower this is.\nIt seems like what ever experiment we have keeps succeeding when we use this flower as catalysis."
<es>

@304
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I like to think this flower as the power of this island."
<es>

@307
<en>{Haruka}\n"Power of this island?"
<es>

@308
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This flower has the power of this island.\nThough that's only a theory of mine......"
<es>

@309
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It could be that these flowers are receiving power from the land. And maybe the key we are serching for could be in the soil."
<es>

@310
<en>{Haruka}\n"Underneath the land?"
<es>

@311
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......there might be something underneath the surface. There is a legend that a star has fallen on this island a long time ago."
<es>

@312
<en>{Haruka}\n"A star? A meteor?"
<es>

@313
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It could be.\nAccording to the legend, that star has become these flowers."
<es>

@316
<en>{Haruka}\n"Well, these flowers do kinda look like a star. People back then are so romantic."
<es>

@317
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not nessasary just a romantic story.\nI've actually found a strong evidence to support the story."
<es>

@320
<en>{Haruka}\n"An evidence? Is it a crater?"
<es>

@321
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not big enough to be called a crater.\nEven if it was a meteor, it could be like a rock size."
<es>

@322
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's worth to dig and serch for the meteor underneath here."
<es>

@323
<en>......are we going to search for it?
<es>

@324
<en>{Haruka}\n"And you think that meteor has the secret."
<es>

@325
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think it's worth making a reserch on it once we find it."
<es>

@326
<en>{Haruka}\n"We have to prepare for this search."
<es>

@327
<en>Don't......
<es>

@328
<en>I don't know why, but that's what came up in my mind first.\nBut I can't talk to them.
<es>

@329
<en>Me in my dream doesn't speak what's in my mind......\nAll I know is that they can't go searching for the meteor......
<es>

@330
<en>I'm scared to see the rest of this dream.\nI don't know why though.
<es>

@333
<en>{Haruka}\n"We'll get ready for this in a hurry."
<es>

@334
<en>Don't......
<es>

@335
<en>I don't wanna see what's coming up next.\nI don't want to......\nbut I can't close my eyes.
<es>

@336
<en>They are in danger......
<es>

@338
<en>{Haruka}\n"Wake up, Kazushi!"
<es>

@341
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!!"
<es>

@342
<en>I jumped up from the bed.
<es>

@346
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh!?"
<es>

@347
<en>Surprised looking Haruka's face was right in front of me.
<es>

@348
<en>{Haruka}\n"What's wrong?\nDid you have a nightmare or something?"
<es>

@349
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm......am I still in my dream?"
<es>

@352
<en>{Haruka}\n"Are you sleep talking?"
<es>

@353
<en>I guess I'm up now.\nI'm so glad I didn't have to watch the rest of my dream.
<es>

@354
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey......?"
<es>

@355
<en>Why am I feeling safe?\nIt's like I know something bad is going to happen in the end and I'm afraid to witness it.
<es>

@356
<en>It can't be.
<es>

@357
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm......?"

<en>{Haruka}\n"Kazushi? Are you all right?"
<es>

@365
<en>{Haruka}\n"That's a funny dream."
<es>

@366
<en>I told her about the nightmare I had.
<es>

@367
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't you think it's a weired dream?\nI wonder why I had such a dream......"
<es>

@368
<en>It makes sense Haruka is in my dream.\nBecause she is all I've been thinking lately.
<es>

@371
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's weired.\nI wonder why you actually knew all that?\nDid I tell you any of that?"
<es>

@372
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean?"
<es>

@373
<en>The point she was wondering was little different from mine.
<es>

@374
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What did you say?"
<es>

@377
<en>{Haruka}\n"The dream you just had is exactly about my grand parents."
<es>

@378
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The principal?"
<es>

@379
<en>{Haruka}\n"It's exactly same as how it was when they first got here."
<es>

@380
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really......?"
<es>

@381
<en>{Haruka}\n"The situation is identical. You are filling my grand pa's role."
<es>

@382
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Your grand pa?"
<es>

@385
<en>{Haruka}\n"My grand pa was alchemist."
<es>

@386
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Was he?\nI'm your grand pa......I see."
<es>

@387
<en>No wonder his voice didn't sound like mine.\nThat was her grand pa's voice.
<es>

@388
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Was your grand pa a lot older than the principal?"
<es>

@391
<en>{Haruka}\n"He was her teacher.\nMaybe older by 10, 15 years?"
<es>

@392
<en>I would say Haruka in the dream was around 20, that makes him about 30 or 35.\nThey seemed right around there.
<es>

@393
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But it's still funny."
<es>

@395
<en>It makes all sense, however,\nthe funny thing is,\nwhy would I know all that?
<es>

@396
<en>Everything I saw in my dream should come out from my own experience.
<es>

@397
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's just coincidence, right?"
<es>

@398
<en>I'm getting scared.
<es>

@401
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't know.\nIt sounds like more than just a dream.\nIt has too many things in common."
<es>

@402
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But why me?\nWhy am I seeing this?"
<es>

@403
<en>I have no means to know how it was when the principal first got to this island.
<es>

@406
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't know, eighter.\nUsually, people have dreams from their own everyday experiences."
<es>

@407
<en>Most of the times, people have dreams when they have something to worry about. When you are in love, you have a dream of the person you love.
<es>

@408
<en>Right now, I would most likely to dream about Haruka.\nEven on this one, it started off me talking to Haruka.
<es>

@409
<en>That is why, at first, I thought I was just having a dream about Haruka.
<es>

@410
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey,\ndid Principal look like you when she was yonger?"
<es>

@411
<en>I think somebody told me that before......
<es>

@414
<en>{Haruka}\n"People always have told me that.\nI've seen her younger in the pictures, but people tell me I look even more like her in real."
<es>

@415
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see......"
<es>

@416
<en>So that was her in the dream.\nAnd I was her husband.\nNow it all make sense.
<es>

@417
<en>I'm even more confused.
<es>

@420
<en>{Haruka}\n"You said you were able to tell you were having a dream. It's so funny how you are having a dream while you are having a dream."
<es>

@421
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know.\nIt actually happened to me pretty often when I was little."
<es>

@424
<en>{Haruka}\n"It did?\nAnd you were able to tell you were having a dream, too?"
<es>

@425
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yep, it happened pretty often to me.\nIt never happened to you before?"
<es>

@428
<en>{Haruka}\n"It never happened to me.\nI don't think it happens to anyone."
<es>

@429
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You think so?"
<es>

@430
<en>I think it happened to me many times.\nI don't remember what kind of dreams I had though.
<es>

@434
<en>{Haruka}\n"Knowing you are in the dream is the first step to learn mystic world. Ancient indians trained themselves to percept themselves when they are in the dream."
<es>

@436
<en>{Haruka}\n"Great alchmists in the past have trained the same thing, too."
<es>

@437
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@438
<en>That doesn't impress me.
<es>

@441
<en>{Haruka}\n"This is just my theory, but I think it is my grand ma in your dream.\nAnd you are my grand pa."
<es>

@442
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think so.\nI don't even know them."
<es>

@445
<en>{Haruka}\n"I don't know, either.\nBut I know what happens in the end of the dream ......"
<es>

@446
<en>She shuts her mouth looking all sad.\nShe must know what happens in the end.
<es>

@447
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What happens in the end?"
<es>

@448
<en>{Haruka}\n"Umm......"
<es>

@449
<en>Haruka looks down sadly.
<es>

@457
<en>{Hisae}\n"Here, we are."
<es>

@458
<en>Haruka----I mean, it's the principal, took me to a cave. She says the meteorite would most likely be found somewhere in here.
<es>

@459
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I will go inside and look for the meteorite.\nHisae, you wait here."
<es>

@460
<en>{Hisae}\n"No, I will go in with you."
<es>

@461
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It might be dangerous.\nWe don't know how it is in there."
<es>

@462
<en>{Hisae}\n"I promise I won't be on your way.\nYou promised me we will always be together."
<es>

@463
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But......"
<es>

@466
<en>{Hisae}\n"Let's go in."
<es>

@468
<en>She starts walking toward inside of the cave as if she is going on a picnic.
<es>

@469
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......I guess, it's too late to stop her now."
<es>

@470
<en>I seem to have given up on making her wait outside.
<es>

@471
<en>Little we know there was actually a danger inside at this point......
<es>

@472
<en>I mean Haruka's grand pa-Seibe- didn't know it at this point.
<es>

@473
<en>However......
<es>

@477
<en>We kept going deeper inside the cave for good half an hour relying only on a lamp.
<es>

@483
<en>{Hisae}\n"What is that......?"
<es>

@484
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I can feel strong power coming out from it.\nThat must be the meteorite."
<es>

@485
<en>{Hisae}\n"I feel strong power, too......"
<es>

@486
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"We'll bring it back with us and find out details of the rock. It's existence is very intriguing."
<es>

@487
<en>{Hisae}\n"I agree. Let's bring it back with us."
<es>

@491
<en>The principal tries to pick up the rock.\nBut it doesn't move.\nIt seems like it's buried into the ground.
<es>

@492
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"You shouldn't force it.\nLet's come back here with a tool."
<es>

@495
<en>{Hisae}\n"It's so tempting.\nThe rock we've been looking for is right in front of our eyes."
<es>

@496
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Don't worry, we will come back here."
<es>

@499
<en>{Hisae}\n"I can't help becoming so impatient.\nIsn't there another way?"
<es>

@501
<en>She looks around to see if there is anything she can use to pull it our. She seems not being able to accept leaving here.
<es>

@502
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Hisae, it's not safe to walk around here.\nAll we have is this small lamp and you can't see your footsteps over there."
<es>

@505
<en>{Hisae}\n"I'm fine......"
<es>

@508
<en>{Hisae}\n"Oh no......!?"
<es>

@511
<en>She tried to scream, but falling rocks covers her scream.
<es>

@512
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Hisae!?"
<es>

@513
<en>She disappeared in an instant.
<es>

@516
<en>{Hisae}\n"Help......"
<es>

@517
<en>I heard her cry from underneath.\nI ran up to where her voice came from.\nIt was behind a huge rock where a lamp can't light up.
<es>

@518
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Hisae!!"
<es>

@519
<en>I saw a dark huge hole.\nShe was hanging on top of the hole.
<es>

@520
<en>{Hisae}\n"Seibe......"
<es>

@521
<en>She was barely holding on to the edge of the hole.\nShe was safe.
<es>

@522
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"......thank god.\nStay still. I will pull you up in a second."
<es>

@523
<en>I reached out to grab her. ......I mean, he did. He grabbed her arm and pulled her up with his everything.
<es>

@524
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Come on......almost there......"
<es>

@525
<en>Her entire upper body is out now.\nShe hugs me.\nI finally pulled her up completely.
<es>

@529
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"......it's all right now."
<es>

@532
<en>{Hisae}\n"Thank you for helping me.\nI almost gave up.\nI didn' know how strong you are till now."
<es>

@533
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I'm strong enough to protect the one I love."
<es>

@536
<en>{Hisae}\n"......the one you love......"
<es>

@537
<en>She blushes her cheeks.\nIt reminds me of Haruka.
<es>

@538
<en>However, she's not Haruka.\nThe excitement I'm feeling now belongs to Seibe.
<es>

@539
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Anyway, we should leave here for a safer place."
<es>

@542
<en>{Hisae}\n"I agree."
<es>

@543
<en>I stood up as I hold her hand.\nThat's when something fell from the ceiling.
<es>

@544
<en>{Hisae}\n"What was that......?"
<es>

@545
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"Watch out!!"
<es>

@547
<en>I pushed her away quickly.\nA huge rock fell down on me.
<es>

@551
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"No!!"
<es>

@555
<en>It's dark. I don't see anything.
<es>

@556
<en>{Hisae}\n"Seibe!"
<es>

@557
<en>I hear the principal's voice.\nI seem to be still alive.
<es>

@561
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I'm glad I'm still alive."
<es>

@562
<en>{Hisae}\n"Seibe......!!"
<es>

@565
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I think we are locked in here.\nLet me try moving this rock......!?"
<es>

@566
<en>I felt a sharp pain when I tried to stand up.\nI couldn't stand up on my own.
<es>

@567
<en>{Hisae}\n"What's wrong? Are you all right?"
<es>

@568
<en>She is worried.
<es>

@569
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I think I just broke my leg.\nBut I'm fine."
<es>

@570
<en>{Hisae}\n"A broken leg!? Oh no......"
<es>

@571
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"I just need to stay still.\nBut we need to get out of here."
<es>

@572
<en>{Hisae}\n"You stay still!\nI will get us out of here."
<es>

@573
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"But how......?"
<es>

@574
<en>This rock is too big for a woman to move aside.
<es>

@575
<en>{Hisae}\n"I will go get help!\nYou wait for me here!"
<es>

@579
<en>She dashed away.\nIt's so quiet in here.
<es>

@580
<en>It is absolutely dark here.\nThe only thing I can hear is my own breathing.
<es>

@581
<en>There is still a sharp pain on my leg.\nI'm starting to feel fear.
<es>

@582
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"She said she will go get help......"
<es>

@583
<en>I know she won't be able to.\nThere is only me and her on this island.\nWe came to a no man's land.
<es>

@584
<en>It was still some time later people start to live in this island.
<es>

@585
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"There is no hope......"
<es>

@586
<en>I know she doesn't know how to pilot the ship.\nThe key is here.
<es>

@587
<en>I, I mean Seibe, already knew he was going to die.
<es>

@593
<en>As I expected, she came back alone. It's been quite a while since she went out to get some help. She probably couldn't give up finding somebody.
<es>

@595
<en>{Hisae}\n"I'm sorry......"
<es>

@596
<en>She feels responsible for not being able to find someone.
<es>

@597
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"It's not your fault.\nIt was just an accident."
<es>

@598
<en>{Hisae}\n"But you got injured trying to rescue me......"
<es>

@599
<en>{Mr.Seibe}\n"We would both have been locked in.\nWe should be glad at least you are saved."
<es>

@600

<es>

@606

@625
<en>I couldn't tell how much time has passed by.\nSeibe can barely speak.\nNo water, no food.
<es>

@626
<en>It's same for the principal.\nShe's been smacking the rock day and night.
<es>

@627
<en>She must be worn out.

@629

<es>

@630
