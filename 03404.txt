<en>{Kazushi}\n *YAWN*
<es>

@8
<en>That was a big yawn. It even made me cry.
<es>

@9
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder why I'm wide awake at night and can barely keep my eyes open during the day."
<es>

@10
<en>I became effectively nocturnal after summer break started.
<es>

@11
<en>We all partied until morning last night, but now everyone was asleep while I was left awake.
<es>

@12
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I'm full now. Maybe I should try getting some sleep."
<es>

@13
<en>I have to be careful not to sleep too much.
<es>

@14
<en>If I nap for too long, I won't be able to sleep again at night.
<es>

@17
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@18
<en>I heard someone's footsteps running towards me. It sounded like there was trouble, so I sat up.
<es>

@24
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh! Harucchi!"
<es>

@25
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Have you seen Natsume-chan around here?"
<es>

@26
<en>It was Mizuki and Sakura. They seemed to be in a hurry.
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No.\nHas she run away somewhere?"
<es>

@30
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's because Sakura forced herself on her."
<es>

@33
<en>{Sakura}\n"She was so cute. I couldn't help it."
<es>

@36
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I know, but......"
<es>

@37
<en>Sakura had hearts for eyes, and I wondered what the problem was. Either way, it didn't seem like it was serious.
<es>

@38
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So, what did you do to her this time?"
<es>

@41
<en>{Sakura}\n"You make it sound like I'm a bad girl. I didn't do anything wrong. I just tried to make her wear some pretty clothes."
<es>

@42
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You used her as a dress-up doll?"
<es>

@45
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Anyways, if you see Natsume-chan, grab a hold of her for us, will you?"
<es>

@46
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Got it."
<es>

@47
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Let's try this way."
<es>

@50
<en>{Sakura}\n"We need to find her soon or there'll be trouble. If she wanders around and runs into some pervert in that outfit, she'll be in danger."
<es>

@55
<en>They left in a hurry.
<es>

@56
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What was that all about?"
<es>

@57
<en>I wonder what they did to her.
<es>

@58
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well......"
<es>

@59
<en>I wasn't doing much of anything anyways. Maybe I should help.
<es>
