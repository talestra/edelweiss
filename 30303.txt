<en>A sturdy key broke off.
<es>

@10
<en>{Ran}\n"No one is here?"
<es>

@11
<en>Ran quickly looks both sides and opens the door.
<es>

@12
<en>{Ran}\n"Let's go."
<es>

@13
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay."
<es>

@18
<en>Being in the laboratory on the weekend feels a bit strange.
<es>

@21
<en>{Ran}\n"Here we are! No one saw us, right?"
<es>

@23
<en>Ran puts down her stuff and exhales slowly.
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess so. Why do we have to sneak in here? Don't we get permission to use this room?"
<es>

@27
<en>{Ran}\n"No, we don't. They said no"
<es>

@28
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? No? Why not?"
<es>

@29
<en>We are just trying to do homework here. It's very strange for them not to allow us to use the room.
<es>

@32
<en>{Ran}\n"They were worried so much that Ms. Ibuki even wanted to help us do the experiment. I guess they don't trust us much."
<es>

@33
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ms. Ibuki wanted to help us? Why not?"
<es>

@34
<en>Her help would be great. It would be a lot better than doing everything by ourselves.
<es>

@37
<en>{Ran}\n"What are you talking about? We cannot show it to Ms. Ibuki!"
<es>

@38
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?"
<es>

@39
<en>Are you going to do something we cannot show to Ms. Ibuki?
<es>

@42
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes. That's why I stole the lab key. If they catch me, you and I - both of us - are gonna be in trouble, okay?"
<es>

@43
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?!"
<es>

@44
<en>This is getting out of hand. It sounds more than just doing homework.
<es>

@47
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't be scared. You got the balls, right? Take your stuff down there, will you?"
<es>

@48
<en>She is right. It is too late to complain now. I lay down the stuff we bought at Mr.Miya's store.
<es>

@49
<en>{Ran}\n"This place is going to be our home for a while."
<es>

@50
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can we really do this without permission? Besides, you and me will be sleeping in the same room..., right?"
<es>

@51
<en>Just a thought turns me on.
<es>

@52
<en>{Ran}\n"What are you talking about now? We have already gone all the way in our relationship. Sleeping together is not a big deal any more."
<es>

@53
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah...you're right."
<es>

@54
<en>She is so down-to-earth. I wonder all the women become like that after sex? Don't they want be in a little more romantic mood or something?
<es>

@57
<en>{Ran}\n"We got to be careful not to be caught."
<es>

@58
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah."
<es>

@59
<en>A lot of problems have happened to me. So I really have a funny feeling about this.
<es>

@60
<en>{Ran}\n"We are fine. No one comes here during the break. In this studio, we have everything we need to get by every day."
<es>

@61
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All we have to is just to do it."
<es>

@62
<en>{Ran}\n"That's right. Let's give it a shot."
<es>

@63
<en>Our life in the lab has just started.
<es>

@67
<en>We sorted things out until afternoon. We set fire on a quite big furnace equipped in the room.
<es>

@68
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Now this looks like a serious experiment."
<es>

@71
<en>{Ran}\n"Of course, it is. You got to make it look good first. "If you build it, they will come."You know?"
<es>

@72
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Looks come first, right? I remember when I first tried to do snowboarding, what I first did was I bought the whole set of snowboarding items."
<es>

@73
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But I only used them once. That's it. I regretted so much."
<es>

@77
<en>{Ran}\n"Haha. A bad example. Let me guess. You tried to express the girls with it, but it didn't work. Then you quit, right?"
<es>

@78
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How do you know that? You saw it?"
<es>

@80
<en>I went snowboarding last winter with other guys, which was a disaster. I accidentally stopped a ski lift because I fell off from the chair.
<es>

@81
<en>Then I got stuck upon the hill because I accidentally got into the lane for the experienced only.
<es>

@82
<en>Also, I got lost in the mountain and got rescued later on. Some gay guy tried to make a pass at us (especially Appo). It was a total fiasco.
<es>

@85
<en>{Ran}\n"I know exactly what you are thinking. By the way, why don't we eat something now?"
<es>

@86
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The whole set of snowboarding items I got was damn expensive, you know?"
<es>

@88
<en>I realized that the slopes make all the girls look cure, but not all the boys. I learned that a hard way.
<es>

@89
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, you want two eggs?"
<es>

@90
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Eggs?"
<es>

@91
<en>Ran is asking me from the kitchen. There is a nice smell wafting from the room next door.
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm? Are you cooking something?"
<es>

@93
<en>There is a kitchen in the room next door. As Ran said earlier, there are facilities available for people to stay overnight .
<es>

@94
<en>Ran is cooking with a fry pan in her hand.
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can you really cook?"
<es>

@98
<en>{Ran}\n"This is not a feast or anything. But I want you to taste something good."
<es>

@99
<en>Impressive! I didn't' know Ran is such a domestic person.
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's a nice looking view."
<es>

@101
<en>This is what they call "an image gap". She looks damn cute n the kitchen holding a pan.
<es>

@102
<en>What if I hug her now?
<es>

@106
<en>{Ran}\n"Ahh. Not now. Later..."
<es>

@108
<en>I wonder if she says sweat things like that...
<es>

@111
<en>{Ran}\n"He looks absent-minded. Now is the time to put this in."
<es>

@112
<en>Ran puts something in.
<es>

@113
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@114
<en>I just saw Ran doing something odd.
<es>

@115
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, did you just put something in there?"
<es>

@118
<en>{Ran}\n"What? No. Look, you are gonna become supper strong when you eat this."
<es>

@119
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah! I can't wait for your homemade dishes!"
<es>

@120
<en>{Ran}\n"I am almost done. Just wait for a second."
<es>

@121
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow. What a great smell!!"
<es>

@122
<en>This invites my appetite for sure. It must have been a special favor she just put in. I bet it tastes gorgeous!
<es>

@127
<en>Nothing happened at the beginning.
<es>

@128
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This tastes really good, Ran."
<es>

@131
<en>{Ran}\n"Good! Eat more, Kazushi."
<es>

@132
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right! I will take some more then!"
<es>

@133
<en>Ran's home cooking tastes just great. It's unique and homely.
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know people sometimes say "Alchemy is like cooking."
<es>

@137
<en>{Ran}\n"I have heard of that."
<es>

@138
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If so, you must be good at alchemy, Ran, because you are a good cook."
<es>

@139
<en>{Ran}\n"No, I don't think so. There is a fundamental difference between cooking and alchemy."
<es>

@140
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whatever. I don't even know how similar and different they are anyway."
<es>

@143
<en>{Ran}\n"When it comes to alchemy, you are a lot better than me, Kazushi. I'm counting on you for this experiment."
<es>

@144
<en>We just enjoy the food and talking until...
<es>

@147
<en>...the time I begin to feel something wacky.
<es>

@148
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's getting hot here..."
<es>

@149
<en>I feel extremely hot. My sight becomes very blurred and twisted.
<es>

@152
<en>{Ran}\n"Me too. I feel also..."
<es>

@153
<en>Her face is becoming red. She must be feeling hot too.
<es>

@154
<en>{Ran}\n"My heart is pounding so fast."
<es>

@155
<en>Ran breathes heavily. Is she having a difficulty to breathe? At the same time, she throws her watery, glittering eyes at me. .
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, is something weird going on here?"
<es>

@159
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmm...Yeah...Very wired...But why is this happening to me too?"
<es>

@160
<en>What is she talking about?
<es>

@161
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What did she mean by that?"
<es>

@162
<en>She sounds like she already knew something would happen to me. No, that is not what I meant, Kazushi...
<es>

@163
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, no?....Hmm?"
<es>

@164
<en>Hey, something is really wired. Yes, something is wired.
<es>

@167
<en>{Ran}\n"What?"
<es>

@168
<en>What is this? I can hear what Kazushi is thinking in his head. Wait, that's my line! I, too, can hear Ran's voice in my head...
<es>

@169
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What the hell is this?"
<es>

@170
<en>{Ran}\n"No idea. I just put a high-potency drug in your dish."
<es>

@171
<en>{Kazushi}\n"High-potency drug?"
<es>

@172
<en>No wonder I feel like burning. Why did you put that kind of stuff?
<es>

@173
<en>{Ran}\n"I just borrowed this from the school drug storage. But why is it that I have been affected as well?"
<es>

@174
<en>Ran takes a look at the drug container and reads its description.
<es>

@177
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh! Shit! This also works through its smell."
<es>

@178
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The smell? This sweaty smell?"
<es>

@179
<en>Evidently, the smell of the drug is not only inviting appetite but also...
<es>

@180
<en>{Ran}\n"Hmm...what is this erotic feeling I got?"
<es>

@181
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Erotic feeling?... It sounds too graphic."
<es>

@182
<en>Ran is wiggling her private part. Oops, my dick is fuckin' big already.
<es>

@183
<en>{Ran}\n"That's pretty graphic too, Kazushi. It makes me feel more...."
<es>

@184
<en>Ran looks down at her legs. I see something shiny run down in the inner side of her thigh.
<es>

@185
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is that?"
<es>

@188
<en>{Ran}\n"I'm so wet..."
<es>

@189
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?! You are wet!!"
<es>

@190
<en>She is so wet that her love juice is dripping down.
<es>

@191
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow..."
<es>

@192
<en>{Ran}\n"You too, Kazushi..."
<es>

@193
<en>With her watery eyes, Ran stares at the bulge in my crotch.
<es>

@194
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!!"
<es>

@195
<en>My groin stands up high like a wood stick being inside my pants.
<es>

@196
<en>I didn't' t even notice this myself until now.
<es>

@199
<en>{Ran}\n"Kazushi, you look stuffy."
<es>

@200
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You too, Ran."
<es>

@201
<en>Both of us are like burning with fever.
<es>

@202
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can we do it?"
<es>

@203
<en>I press Ran on me and she buries her face into my chest.
<es>

@206
<en>{Ran}\n"Wait!"
<es>

@207
<en>What?
<es>

@208
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is this? I'm about to explode."
<es>

@211
<en>{Ran}\n"How much do you have now?"
<es>

@212
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you taking money for this?"
<es>

@213
<en>{Ran}\n"Of course! A hedge between keeps friendship green."
<es>

@214
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A hedge is money?"
<es>

@215
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't you want to do it now? If you don't, I don't care...."
<es>

@216
<en>Incompatible with her words, Ran's body trembles. Her body is pretty honest.
<es>

@217
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Your body says otherwise. You wanna do it so bad, don't you?"
<es>

@220
<en>{Ran}\n"That's right! Hurry up and give me some money!!"
<es>

@221
<en>She is desperately demanding money. I can no longer fight back my feeling. I want to fuck right away!!
<es>

@222
<en>I got no choice. I fumble in my pockets for the wallet.
<es>

@223
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shit! I left my wallet in my room!"
<es>

@226
<en>{Ran}\n"Stupid....!!"
<es>

@227
<en>Ran blows her top.
<es>

@228
<en>{Ran}\n"How could you leave your wallet in your room?! You would get yourself killed if you didn't have any money!!"
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Getting myself killed?"
<es>

@232
<en>{Ran}\n"Don't you have some in your pocket?"
<es>

@233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@235
<en>I turn my pocket inside out.
<es>

@236
<en>Something drops..
<es>

@237
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahh!"
<es>

@238
<en>{Ran}\n"Yes!? How much?"
<es>

@239
<en>{Kazushi}\n"50 yen!!"
<es>

@240
<en>{Ran}\n"Fine. Put that in here now!!"
<es>
