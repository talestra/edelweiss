<en>{Ran}\n"You've nothing to be sorry about. I didn't think you had the money anyways."

@18
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But you asked for money. Are you sure you're not having any sort of problems?"

<en>Ran returned to normal. It was more like her to have a steely smile than to be worried about something.

<en>I still have no idea what this was all about.
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh well......"
