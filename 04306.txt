<es>

@25
<en>{Appo-}\n"It's easy. First you make a pass at them in the woods behind their dorm. And you go to their room and make a pass at them again. And you take them to the little open area by the pool and make a pass at them again."
<es>

@26
<en>{Appo-}\n"You can also use shower room when it's empty. And after lunch, you go into the woods behind the gym and make a pass at them again."
<es>

<es>

@39
<en>{Appo-}\n"Because when a girl is in your room looking at your old album, it's a sign of acceptance. To me, you're already in your foreplay."
