<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan? Are you here?"
<es>

@9
<en>I called out, loudly, to try and find her. As it was the middle of summer vacation, the campus was as quiet as it could be.
<es>

@16
<en>I walked around, listening to my own footsteps. It was cool inside the building, even without air conditioning, and it was nice.
<es>

@17
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe I should take a nap here."
<es>

@18
<en>It was pleasantly cool, and would make the best spot.
<es>

@19
<en>{Cat}\n"Meow..."
<es>

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@22
<en>I heard the sound of a cat. There was a cat inside the building.
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder where it could be? Meow? Meow?"
<es>

@24
<en>I called out in cat. Not that I actually knew it.
<es>

@25
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mee? Meow?"
<es>

@26
<en>{Cat}\n"Meow. Meow."
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, it worked."
<es>

@28
<en>The cat answered. So, there was a cat somewhere.
<es>

@29
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Meow? Meow, meow."
<es>

@30
<en>{Cat}\n"Mee. Mee. Mee."
<es>

@31
<en>I followed the cat's cries. It sounded like it was coming from one of the freshman classrooms.
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Meow? Meow?"
<es>

@33
<en>{Cat?}\n"Zzz."
<es>

@34
<en>"Zzzz"? That doesn't sound like a cat. What kind of cat makes a sound like that?
<es>

@35
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Quietly, quietly..."
<es>

@37
<en>I slowly opened the door, trying not to surprise the cat.
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where are you? Meow? Meow?"
<es>

@41
<en>{Cat}\n"Meow."
<es>

@42
<en>The cry came from under the desk by the window. I tip-toed to get close to the desk.
<es>

@43
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Meow?"
<es>

@44
<en>I tried to look under the desk as I called out to it.
<es>

@48
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@49
<en>There was a huge cat sleeping there, curled up and surrounded by some regular cats.
<es>

@50
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There you are, Natsume-chan! But what are you wearing..."
<es>

@51
<en>Is she cosplaying? I remembered Sakura saying something about dressing her up, but I didn't know this was what she were talking about.
<es>

@52
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sakura forced you to wear this, huh?"
<es>

@53
<en>Maybe that's why Natsume-chan ran away and hid inside the school building. And then she fell asleep while hiding.
<es>

@54
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But..."
<es>

@55
<en>{Cat}\n"Meow."
<es>

@56
<en>Look at all these cats around her. Is she the type that cats love? Or did the cat ears draw them in?
<es>

@58
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@59
<en>Natsume-chan was frowning, and her eyebrows tensed due to a cat sleeping on her chest.\nOn the other hand, she looks cute when she's mad...
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh-oh, I may be about to set foot down a path that mustn't be tread."
<es>

@61
<en>This kind of play can get addicting. Well, it's not play, but...
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...Guess I'll wake her up."
<es>

@63
<en>I couldn't let her sleep like this for long.
<es>

@64
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan, Natsume-chan. It's morning."
<es>

@65
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan, Natsume-chan."
<es>

@67
<en>{Natsume}\n"Uuuhh... uuh?"
<es>

@68
<en>Her long eyelashes were moving. She might almost be capable of waking up.
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan! If you don't wake up soon, Sakura's going to come get you!"
<es>

@70
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@71
<en>She moaned, and slowly opened her heavy eyelids.
<es>

@73
<en>{Natsume}\n"Auu... Haruma?"
<es>

@74
<en>She looked at me, still half asleep.
<es>

@75
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's Haruma. Don't sleep here, sleep in back in your room."
<es>

@76
<en>{Natsume}\n"Uuuhhh..."
<es>

@77
<en>She moaned, and sounded like she was in a bad mood. Was it because she just woke up? Either way, she rubbed her sleepy eyes.
<es>

@78
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mmmm..."
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, hey. Don't rub your eyes too much. Are your hands clean? You could get sick if you rubbed your eyes with dirty hands."
<es>

@80
<en>I tried to stop her from rubbing her eyes, but she gave me a dirty look despite still being sleepy.
<es>

@81
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm... You always get in my way."
<es>

@82
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, that's not true. Come on. Wake up."
<es>

@84
<en>{Natsume}\n"Zzz..."
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't go back to sleep."
<es>

@86
<en>She was just like my spoiled little sister.\nI can't leave her alone for anything...
<es>

@88
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm... Haruma, you woke me up today. It's the opposite of last time."
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean? Opposite?"
<es>

@90
<en>{Natsume}\n"You didn't kiss me today, right?"
<es>

@91
<en>Natsume-chan made a weird comment, and wiped her lips. I thought I saw blood on her hand, but it was just my imagination.
<es>

@92
<en>...but why blood? Isn't that a bit too weird, even for my imagination?
<es>

@93
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What kiss are you talking about? I didn't kiss you while you were sleeping!"
<es>

@94
<en>{Natsume}\n"How dare you! Well, I guess twice isn't very different from once."
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I haven't kissed you once before."
<es>

@96
<en>Because I've never kissed ANYONE in my life before. Not that I'm proud of it.
<es>

@97
<en>{Natsume}\n"Anyway, I'm glad you're here, Haruma. Go get my clothes. I can't go out like this."
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. I guess."
<es>

@99
<en>If she went out like this, she might get kidnapped by some crazy maniac.
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, wait here."
<es>

@101
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'll be going back to sleep until then."
<es>

@102
<en>She's going back to sleep? I'd better hurry.
<es>

@113
<en>{Sakura}\n"Aww, she changed. What a waste."
<es>

@116
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, a little bit."
<es>

@117
<en>I had to ask Sakura and Mizuki to fetch Natsume-chan's clothes for me. I felt awkward going into the girls' dorm.
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She sure did look awfully good in it, though. It's too bad."
<es>

@121
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wow, here he is, the lolicon."
<es>

@124
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, are you?"
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am not a lolicon! Don't make such horrible comments."
<es>

@128
<en>{Natsume}\n"No wonder your gaze always sticks to me like a slug."
<es>

@131
<en>{Mizuki}\n"R-really... I thought you were at least a good guy at heart."
<es>

@132
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am a nice guy!"
<es>

@133
<en>{Sakura}\n"Let's all bully him as a class next semester. On the first day of school, we'll leave a vase with a chrysanthemum on his desk, and we'll all ignore Harucchi."
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No! Please don't do that!!"
<es>

@135
<en>It made me shiver just thinking about such a bleak life.
<es>

@138
<en>{Natsume}\n"You're a meanie, Umeko. Don't come near me anymore."
<es>

@143
<en>{Sakura}\n"Ah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Onee-chan's a kind girl. I'll bring more cute clothes for you to wear, okay?"
<es>

@146
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't need them. I won't wear them anymore."
<es>

@147
<en>Natsume-chan was in quite a foul mood. I'm not taking Sakura's side, but they did look good on her.
<es>

@148
<en>......I'm not a lolicon, okay?
<es>

@151
<en>{Mizuki}\n"See? Natsume-chan's upset because you forced her to wear that, Sakura!"
<es>

@154
<en>{Sakura}\n"Then maybe we can try a hot nurse next time."
<es>

@155
<en>{Natsume}\n"No 'then'. No 'then'."
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not about whether she looks good in it or not. By the way, just who and where did you get those outfits?"
<es>

@159
<en>{Sakura}\n"I have a secret route. Do you want to know about it, Harucchi?"
<es>

@160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"N-no, thank you."
<es>

@161
<en>I don't have anyone to wear this stuff for me. ...wait, that's not the problem here.
<es>

@164
<en>{Natsume}\n"Anyway, don't come near me anymore, Umeko. No closer than two meters, got it?"
<es>

@167
<en>{Sakura}\n"What? Seriously?"
<es>

@170
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You brought this upon yourself. You'd better say you're sorry."
<es>

@175
<en>{Sakura}\n"OK, fine. Just don't hate me."
<es>

@176
<en>Sakura tried to hug Natsume-chan, but she slipped away and hid behind Mizuki's back.
<es>

@183
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Just stop that. That girl's so scary, isn't she?"
<es>

@186
<en>{Natsume}\n"..."
<es>

@187
<en>She was nodding. I guess Natsume-chan's scared of Sakura.
<es>

@190
<en>{Sakura}\n"But speaking of scary people, Harucchi's worse if you ask me. After all, he's your natural enemy."
<es>

@191
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why would I be her natural enemy?"
<es>

@194
<en>{Sakura}\n"Because you're a lolicon. That's totally dangerous. Has he attacked you?"
<es>

@195
<en>She said it jokingly, but Natsume-chan nodded her agreement seriously.
<es>

@198
<en>{Natsume}\n"He didn't today, though."
<es>

@203
<en>{Sakura & Mizuki}\n"What? Today??"
<es>

@204
<en>{Kazushi}\n"W-what do you mean, today? I haven't done anything like that."
<es>

@205
<en>{Natsume}\n"You did."
<es>

@206
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What did I do?"
<es>

@209
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What did he do to you? What did this man do to you?!"
<es>

@212
<en>{Natsume}\n"He acted like he was asleep, and when I got close to him, he kissed me."
<es>

@213
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, hey, hey!"
<es>

@218
<en>{Sakura}\n"Y-y-you fiend!!"
<es>

@219
<en>Why does she sound so happy? But that's not the problem, either.
<es>

@220
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Natsume-chan, I'm telling you, I don't know anything about that!!"
<es>

@223
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes, you do."
<es>

@226
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, you disappoint me. Pretending to sleep and attacking a girl isn't fair!"
<es>

@227
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No! This is all a big misunderstanding! I didn't do anything like that!"
<es>

@230
<en>{Natsume}\n"Well, it's fine. I just think of it the same way I would if a stray dog bit me."
<es>

@231
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A stray dog... But, I'm telling you, I didn't do that!"
<es>

@234
<en>{Sakura}\n"Crying away in bed won't help you! We should let the law handle this!"
<es>

@235
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait, the law? Hold on a second..."
<es>

@238
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Shut up, you bastard! Go home!"
<es>

@241
<en>{Sakura}\n"Death penalty! Death penalty!"
<es>

@242
<en>It took them just a short while to turn me into such a criminal.
<es>

@245
<en>{Natsume}\n"Death penalty! Death penalty!"
<es>

@246
<en>Natsume-chan's voice sounded happy.
<es>

@247
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan, are you having fun with this?"
<es>

@250
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shut up, you bastard!"
<es>

@251
<en>She sure looked like she was having fun, so she must've been. Well, it's fine as long as she's happy.
<es>

@252
<en>Is it?
<es>

@263
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I never thought you'd do anything like that."
<es>

@266
<en>{Sakura}\n"Harucchi's actually a nice guy, in spite of how he looks."
<es>

@267
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean? How do I look?"
<es>

@270
<en>{Sakura}\n"A depressed young man?"
<es>

@271
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, that's the truth..."
<es>

@272
<en>But I guess we cleared up that misunderstanding, so at least that's a start.
<es>

@275
<en>{Natsume}\n"Why are you two causing such a fuss? It doesn't matter to you what Haruma does to me, does it?"
<es>

@278
<en>{Sakura}\n"Of course it matters. We can't just leave it alone."
<es>

@281
<en>{Mizuki}\n"We can't allow Kazushi to create more victims."
<es>

@282
<en>Mmm...Mizuki must still hold some kind of grudge against me. Ah well, it's inevitable.
<es>

@285
<en>{Natsume}\n"I think everyone's too worked up over Haruma."
<es>

@286
<en>Natsume-chan was so cool about it compared to those two.
<es>

@289
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But, wouldn't you hate it if he did something to you?"
<es>

@290
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm telling you, I'm not like that!"
<es>

@293
<en>{Natsume}\n"Not really. I can't let the likes of Haruma get me upset at everything."
<es>

@294
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean, 'the likes of'?"
<es>

@295
<en>Sakura and Mizuki exchanged confused looks with each other.
<es>

@298
<en>{Sakura}\n"So..."
<es>

@299
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's OK with you if Kazushi does something to you?"
<es>

@300
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't care."
<es>

@303
<en>{Sakura}\n"Then, what about me?"
<es>

@304
<en>Sakura looked all excited, but Natsume-chan took offence.
<es>

@307
<en>{Natsume}\n"......Don't even make that joke, or I'll make you cry."
<es>

@310
<en>{Sakura}\n"Gaaaaaaah..."
<es>

@311
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Stop that. Hey, Sakura!"
<es>

@312
<en>{Sakura}\n"Mm. This..."
<es>

@318
<en>Sakura and Mizuki were discussing something.
<es>

@323
<en>{Sakura}\n"So you think so too, Mizuki?"
<es>

@324
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Not just thinking but actually..."
<es>

@325
<en>They were whispering, so I couldn't hear everything, but they seemed to agree on something.
<es>

@326
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, what are you talking about?"
<es>

@327
<en>They were talking about something, but eventually brought us back into the conversation. Then, they looked Natsume-chan in the eyes.
<es>

@334
<en>{Sakura}\n"Natsume-chan, do you like Harucchi?"
<es>

@335
<en>......
<es>

@336
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......huh?! What are you saying all of a sudden?!"
<es>

@339
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Just leave it to us."
<es>

@340
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Leave it to you?"
<es>

@343
<en>{Sakura}\n"So, what do you think? Do you like him?"
<es>

@344
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm...? I never thought about it. Why?"
<es>

@347
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well, Kazushi said he likes you. So, what do you want to do?"
<es>

@348
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, you guys!"
<es>

@349
<en>What the hell are they talking about? They were totally ignoring my feelings, and the gears of fate were starting to turn.
<es>

@350
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, hold on. What are you talking about?"
<es>

@353
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Calm down! You'd better take responsibility, you know. Re-spon-si-bil-i-ty."
<es>

@354
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What responsibility? I haven't done anything!"
<es>

@357
<en>{Sakura}\n"How about you Natsume-chan? Do you want him to take responsibility?"
<es>

@360
<en>{Natsume}\n"Responsibility? .........Yeah."
<es>

@361
<en>Natsume-chan thought for a while, and nodded like a toy bird.
<es>

@364
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wow, fabulous! I saw the moment of blossoming love!"
<es>

@365
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, she doesn't understand what 'taking responsibility' means!"
<es>

@366
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't even understand. What kind of responsibility are we talking about?"
<es>

@371
<en>{Sakura}\n"That doesn't matter now. You guys should just start going out!"
<es>

@372
<en>A whisper from the devil. What a cunning smile she has.
<es>

@373
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you saying. It's unfair..."
<es>

@376
<en>{Sakura}\n"You'll never get a girlfriend by playing fair, Harucchi."
<es>

@377
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wha... for real?"
<es>

@378
<en>I've been trying to play fair all along, and sure enough, I don't have a girlfriend. Is that what's been wrong with me?
<es>

@381
<en>{Sakura}\n"Besides, Natsume-chan might be up for it more than you think. She's always sticking around you, Harucchi."
<es>

@386
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, so has love blossomed yet or not?"
<es>

@387
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. Not yet."
<es>

@390
<en>{Sakura}\n"It's about to blossom. Right, Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@396
<en>Sakura was calling for Natsume-chan, and...
<es>

@399
<en>{Sakura}\n"Harucchi said he likes you, so he wants you to be his girlfriend."
<es>

@402
<en>I can't believe she said that.
<es>

@403
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey!! What are you saying?"
<es>

@406
<en>{Sakura}\n"It's OK. It's OK."
<es>

@407
<en>Sakura waited for Natsume-chan's reply like it wasn't any of her concern. Natsume-chan stared at me for a while, and looked down.
<es>

@411
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm sorry."
<es>

@412
<en>She bowed politely, and stated her rejection. I felt all the energy drain out of me as soon as I heard that.
<es>

@418
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? Love didn't blossom?"
<es>

@419
<en>{Sakura}\n"Huh? Ahaha, I guess it didn't work."
<es>

@420
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't laugh!"
<es>

@421
<en>She turned me down. What is this hollow feeling?
<es>

@422
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why do I have to get rejected when I didn't even get the chance to confess... What are you going to do about this?"
<es>

@425
<en>{Sakura}\n"Well, we had the best intentions...but we didn't think she'd reject you. Honestly!"
<es>

@426
<en>I had no idea of what they were up to, but Sakura seemed to believe it would genuinely work out. Of course, nothing could ever be that easy.
<es>

@429
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, so what's wrong with Kazushi? I know he's a dumb idiot, a pervert, and lacking in the looks, but yeah, that's plenty wrong."
<es>

@430
<en>She was making a list of my flaws out loud and reached her own conclusion. That's unspeakably awful!
<es>

@437
<en>{Natsume}\n"I just can't do it."
<es>

@440
<en>{Sakura}\n"Huh? Why? Why? Do you happen to like girls, Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@441
<en>{Natsume}\n"Because I can't remain here long."
<es>

@442
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? You can't stay here long?"

<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, what does that mean?"
<es>

@448
<en>{Sakura}\n"Yeah, what do you mean? Are you going somewhere?"
<es>

@449
<en>Natsume-chan was attacked on all sides by questions, and she frowned like she was reaching her breaking point.
<es>

@452
<en>{Natsume}\n"Don't ask me everything. Think for yourself."
<es>

@453
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We're asking because we don't understand."
<es>

@459
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@460
<en>She turned her back to us and refused to answer any more questions.
<es>

@463
<en>{Sakura}\n"Is Natsume-chan going away somewhere? See, Harucchi? You need to hold onto her so that she won't leave."
<es>

@464
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I'm obviously unable to do that."
<es>

@467
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What a wuss."
<es>

@468
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not my fault. I can't make everything happen all by myself."
<es>

@469
<en>If I could try and change things I would, but Natsume-chan seemed put off by me, and I couldn't force myself upon her.
<es>

@470
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, she rejected me, after all..."
<es>

@471
<en>The fact that she didn't take me as her boyfriend was starting to affect me. She actually rejected me...
<es>

@474
<en>{Sakura}\n"Huh? Huh? Huh? Harucchi, you look pale?"
<es>

@475
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't take it. The fact that Natsume-chan rejected me is finally hitting home."
<es>

@478
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Are you OK? What are we going to do, Sakura?"
<es>

@481
<en>{Sakura}\n"Uh, I'm sorry... Then, umm, Harucchi, would you like to go out with me?"
<es>

@488
<en>{Natsume}\n"......?!?"
<es>

@494
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? Really? Sakura, did you like Kazushi?"
<es>

@495
<en>{Kazushi}\n"D-do you?"
<es>

@500
<en>{Natsume}\n"......?!?"
<es>

@506
<en>{Sakura}\n"Don't be so surprised, you guys. Well, it's not like I hate Harucchi. I like him on the level of 'he works in the worst case scenario'."
<es>

@507
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm your worst case scenario..."
<es>

@508
<en>So she doesn't really like me. Is she just feeling sorry for me? I'm probably even more worthless than I thought...
<es>

@511
<en>{Sakura}\n"But well... it's okay. It might be fun to have a random summer fling like that."
<es>

@512
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're a loose woman, Sakura. You should take better care of yourself."
<es>

@517
<en>{Natsume}\n"..."
<es>

@518
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? Natsume-chan thinks so, too."
<es>

@524
<en>{Sakura}\n"Agh, enough, quit griping. I have made my decision! I'm going to go out with Harucchi!"
<es>

@525
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You've made your decision?"
<es>

@528
<en>{Sakura}\n"I'm starting to think this is the best idea ever! Let's have fun, Harucchi!"
<es>

@529
<en>She decided to be my girlfriend on her own, and now clung to my arm.
<es>

@532
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Does this mean love's blossomed?"
<es>

@533
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, no, no."
<es>

@536
<en>{Sakura}\n"Harucchi! Yeah, I'm getting used to it. It might be a great idea for real!"
<es>

@537
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you serious?"
<es>

@541
<en>Am I actually going to get to date Sakura? What am I going to do?!
<es>

@546
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh...?"
<es>

@547
<en>Something made a really loud noise next to me.
<es>

@552
<en>{Sakura}\n"Fumiii?"
<es>

@553
<en>Sakura was like a marionette with the strings cut. The whites of her eyes were showing.
<es>

@560
<en>{Mizuki}\n"N-Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@561
<en>Natsume-chan had a frying pan in her hand. Where did she get that?
<es>

@562
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? Did you get her with that? Sakura, are you okay?"
<es>

@563
<en>{Sakura}\n"Fumiii..."
<es>

@564
<en>Maybe not.
<es>

@565
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sakura? Hey, Sakura? This is bad."
<es>

@566
<en>{Natsume}\n"Umeko, don't come within 3 meters of Haruma or me."
<es>

@567
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think she can hear you..."
<es>

@568
<en>{Sakura}\n"Fumii..."
<es>

@573
<en>We took her to the nurse's office, and put her to bed.
<es>

@574
<en>She wasn't injured too badly, and they gave her some pills and rubbed some ointment made from a special herb mixture on there.
<es>

@577
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Don't worry, this stuff's the best. I used it when I cut my legs swimming near some rocks. It only took that night to heal up."
<es>

@578
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK, so she should be fine, then."
<es>

@580
<en>{Sakura}\n"Zzz...zzz..."
<es>

@581
<en>Sakura had calmed down, and was sleeping well. Natsume-chan was looking over Sakura in her bed.
<es>

@585
<en>{Natsume}\n"..."
<es>

@586
<en>She started drawing a giant moustache on Sakura with a marker.
<es>

@587
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey! You can't draw on people's faces, especially when they're asleep."
<es>

@588
<en>{Natsume}\n"Why not? It's a nice mustache."
<es>

@589
<en>Indeed, Sakura already had quite a dandyish moustache.
<es>

@590
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can't do that even if it does look nice. Sakura's out cold because of you - do you really understand what you did?"
<es>

@593
<en>{Natsume}\n"......Yeah."
<es>

@594
<en>It looked like she was capable of feeling guilt after all.
<es>

@595
<en>{Natsume}\n"I had a small part in it."
<es>

@596
<en>Only a small part?
<es>

@597
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can't hit someone with a frying pan from behind again, OK?"
<es>

@598
<en>{Natsume}\n"I won't do it again. I just got a little upset."
<es>

@599
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can't do that even if you get upset. Promise?"
<es>

@600
<en>It seemed childish, but I made her pinky swear.
<es>

@603
<en>{Natsume}\n"I got it. Don't rub it in."
<es>

@608
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Looks like Natsume-chan understands. I'm sure Sakura's happy in her grave."
<es>

@609
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's alive. It's kind of like a wake, surrounding her like this."
<es>

@612
<en>{Sakura}\n"Zzz... zzz..."
<es>

@613
<en>She sure slept well. Natsume-chan sat on the chair next to Sakura's bed, and looked down at her face.
<es>

@616
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'll stay with her, so you all can go."
<es>

@617
<en>She was willing to stay until Sakura wakes up. She must've been feeling guilty.
<es>

@618
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll stay here too."
<es>

@619
<en>I grabbed a chair, and sat next to Natsume-chan.
<es>

@623
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well... should I be going?"
<es>

@624
<en>Mizuki was still standing up and trying to decide if she should sit down as well. She looked restless, and her eyes darted around the room.
<es>

@625
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't mind us. But we'll be here, so you're free to go."
<es>

@629
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@633
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Are you sure? Then I guess I'll leave it up to you guys..."
<es>

@636
<en>She forced herself to smile, and bolted from the nurse's office. What on Earth was she thinking?
<es>

@639
<en>{Natsume}\n"........."
<es>

@640
<en>Natsume-chan kept looking at Sakura's sleeping face, but I felt like she was thinking about me.
<es>

@641
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh. Should I leave as well?"
<es>

@642
<en>I remembered that she just rejected me a few minutes earlier - I'd forgotten about it in all the chaos.
<es>

@643
<en>Why would I remember that now that we were alone?
<es>

@644
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll leave if I'm in the way..."
<es>

@647
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@648
<en>But instead, Natsume-chan shook her head. I guess it's OK for me to stay.
<es>

@649
<en>{Natsume}\n"I never thought you were in the way."
<es>

@650
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah? Well, if you insist, though you did reject me just now."
<es>

@653
<en>{Natsume}\n"I didn't reject you."
<es>

@654
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? But..."
<es>

@655
<en>What she said was "I'm sorry", but isn't that a rejection?
<es>

@658
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm just a shadow. That's why I can't answer. I said sorry for not being able to answer."
<es>

@659
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uhh..."
<es>

@660
<en>She apologized for being unable to answer? I don't understand...
<es>

@661
<en>But I guess that means she didn't reject me, after all. But shadow?
<es>

@662
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean by shadow?"
<es>

@665
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't know. Don't ask me everything. Think for yourself."
<es>

@666
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am, but this is confusing."
<es>

@667
<en>A shadow, huh? What does she mean? Like shadows and light?
<es>

@668
<en>If Natsume-chan is a shadow, then where's the light?
<es>

@671
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@672
<en>But Natsume-chan seemed unwilling to answer me. She just looked mad, and kept staring at Sakura's face.
<es>

@674
<en>At that moment, I felt like Natsume-chan could vanish in an instant. Her existence felt thin and weak.
<es>

@675
<en>Come to think of it, the way she appeared from nowhere was unreal. It's like her existence wasn't rooted to this world.
<es>

@676
<en>She might vanish if you look away...
<es>

@677
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then I'll think about it myself. I should be able to work out the answer if I really think about it, right?"
<es>

@678
<en>That's why I wanted a stronger connection with her. I wanted to be connected to her as much as possible. If thinking will connect us, then I'll think away.
<es>

@681
<en>{Natsume}\n"You should understand without thinking. You already know."
<es>

@682
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Really?"
<es>

@683
<en>Now I understood even less. I already knew?
<es>

@685
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wahh! Give me back my saddle!"
<es>

@686
<en>Sakura's voice startled my thoughts away. I thought she was awake, but she was just talking in her sleep.
<es>

@687
<en>{Sakura}\n"We can't reach the goal without a saddle..."
<es>

@688
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What goal?"
<es>

@691
<en>{Natsume}\n"Umeko's an idiot, even in her sleep."
<es>

@692
<en>We both watched as Sakura continued to sleep. What should I do? How can I approach Natsume-chan...
<es>

@693
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I stay by your side, Natsume-chan? If you don't mind, then can I continue staying by your side?"
<es>

@696
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't mind."
<es>

@697
<en>That was a plain answer, but it made me feel relaxed. So, we could still hang out like we used to.
<es>

@698
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK. Then let's do it."
<es>

@699
<en>{Natsume}\n"OK."
<es>

@700
<en>It seemed like a lot of things had happened, but we were back to the start. No progress and no retreat.
<es>

@701
<en>However, it felt different from just standing still.
<es>

@702
<en>We took two steps forward and two steps back, but we still took those steps. Maybe I was closer to her by at least a little bit.
<es>

@703
<en>But things became more confusing as I got closer.
<es>

@707
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@708
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I told you not to draw a moustache on her."
<es>

@715
<en>{Sakura}\n"No, the dead dog said not to go here."
<es>

@716
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That was a dangerous episode. What happened to the saddle? Did she reach the goal?"
<es>

@719
<en>{Sakura}\n"Huh? What are you talking about?"
<es>

@720
<en>Didn't she remember that dream? Well, it's nice that she's back in reality.
<es>

@722
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I told you, human life is very important. Never make light of it again, okay?"
<es>

@723
<en>I preached to Natsume-chan, who was sitting next to me.
<es>

@726
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mmm, mmm...yeah..."
<es>

@728
<en>She wasn't really listening. She was having trouble eating her buttered corn.
<es>

@729
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're pretty bad with chopsticks."
<es>

@732
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shut up."
<es>

@737
<en>{Rin}\n"Aren't those chopsticks too long for you, Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@744
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, yeah. Those are the cafeteria chopsticks. Don't you have some of your own?"
<es>

@748
<en>She was using the chopsticks supplied by the cafeteria.
<es>

@749
<en>All the boys didn't mind using them, but the girls always carried around their own personal chopsticks.
<es>

@750
<en>I guess they hated the thought of using the same chopsticks as the boys, even if they got washed after every meal.
<es>

@751
<en>Apparently all the girls bought their own before we arrived.
<es>

@752
<en>None of the guys cared about it at all, so we used the school's chopsticks, but Natsume-chan didn't have her own, either.
<es>

@757
<en>{Haruka}\n"Those may be too long for you. Do you want to go buy some chopsticks of your own tomorrow? I can show you the town as well."
<es>

@760
<en>{Sakura}\n"Why don't you ask Harucchi to show you around, then? You'd like that better, right Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@765
<en>{Natsume}\n"...I'll do that. Haruma, take me."
<es>

@766
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you alright with me?"
<es>

@767
<en>{Natsume}\n"......Yeah."
<es>

@768
<en>I guess I don't have a reason to say no.
<es>

@769
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok! Let's go tomorrow."
<es>

@770
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@774
<en>{Haruka}\n"Then I'll lend you my bike. You'll have to push it up the hill when you come back, but it's super fast going down!"
<es>

@778
<en>{Natsume}\n"I can't ride a bike."
<es>

@779
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? Then you can ride on the back. Let's borrow the bike!"
<es>

@782
<en>{Natsume}\n"! ...!"
<es>

@783
<en>She was nodding like crazy. She seemed to be curious about it, so I felt like looking forward to hit.
<es>

@789
<en>We hit the hill with great momentum.
<es>

@790
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We're going fast, so hang on tight!"
<es>

@791
<en>{Natsume}\n"Y-yeah..."
<es>

@792
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wow?"
<es>

@793
<en>I leaned forward to gather speed. I was still pedaling as hard as I could.
<es>

@794
<en>The bike was going faster and faster.
<es>

@795
<en>{Natsume}\n"W-wooow!!"
<es>

@796
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, hang on tight!"
<es>

@797
<en>She'd only put her hands on my shoulders, so I told her to hang on tight.
<es>

@798
<en>It felt like a small, warm creature was sitting against my back. It was a comforting feeling.
<es>

@799
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok! Let's go faster!"
<es>

@800
<en>{Natsume}\n"E-even faster?"
<es>

@801
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Even faster!"
<es>

@804
<en>I pedaled some more. We were going so fast, it was hard to tell if we were going downhill or we were flat out falling.
<es>

@805
<en>The landscaping on both sides passed by us at unbelievable speed.
<es>

@806
<en>{Natsume}\n"Woooooow, wooooow?"
<es>

@807
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's like a roller-coaster, huh?"
<es>

@808
<en>{Natsume}\n"......!"
<es>

@809
<en>She tightened her grip. I felt it as a token of her trust, and it made me feel good.
<es>

@810
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This feels great!! Why don't you practice riding a bike, Natsume-chan?"
<es>

@811
<en>{Natsume}\n"...No. I'll ask you."
<es>

@812
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Come on, it's so much fun to ride one on your own!"
<es>

@813
<en>{Natsume}\n"No. You're my driver."
<es>

@814
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm your driver? I guess that's fine with me, but it's pretty unusual that you've never ridden a bike."
<es>

@815
<en>{Natsume}\n"My mom didn't ride one. No one taught me."
<es>

@816
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How about your dad?"
<es>

@817
<en>Wasn't that a father's responsibility?
<es>

@818
<en>{Natsume}\n"Papa..."
<es>

@819
<en>As soon as I asked her about her father, she stopped talking. It was a gloomy silence.
<es>

@820
<en>Was that something I shouldn't have asked?
<es>

@821
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, ask me anytime you want to ride a bike. I'll give you a ride."
<es>

@822
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ok, I'll do that."
<es>

@823
<en>I guess she had her reasons. It would make me happy if she talked to me about whatever problems she had someday.
<es>

@824
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow!"
<es>

@825
<en>At that moment, we saw the sparkling ocean in front of us.
<es>

@826
<en>The blue ocean was reflecting the sun, and it looked like the ocean was sprinkling countless jewels all over the place.
<es>

@827
<en>I felt like we were diving into the ocean as we zoomed downhill towards it.
<es>

@828
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume-chan! Look, in front!"
<es>

@829
<en>Natsume-chan poked her head around my shoulder. She opened her eyes into the blowing wind, and looked at the view beneath us.
<es>

@830
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ah, the ocean... or the sky?"
<es>

@831
<en>As we went downhill, we were greeted by the blue sky and the ocean. It was hard to tell where the ocean ended and the sky began.
<es>

@832
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's like we're flying."
<es>

@833
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah!!"
<es>

@834
<en>I felt like my body was being torn to pieces as the wind blew hard on us.
<es>

@835
<en>I felt like I was being torn into smaller and smaller pieces and melting into the air. It was almost like flying.
<es>

@836
<en>{Natsume}\n"Amazing! It feels incredible!"
<es>

@837
<en>Natsume-chan sounded excited. That might've been the first time I ever heard her like that.
<es>

@838
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Does it? Okay, then we're going to fly even more!!"
<es>

@839
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@842
<en>I stood up from the saddle. I stepped on the pedals as hard as I could to make it fly.
<es>

@843
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ah, that's enough. That's enough."
<es>

@844
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not yet!"
<es>

@845
<en>{Natsume}\n"Hhh... Kyaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!"
<es>

@846
<en>We became the wind.
<es>

@853
<en>{Natsume}\n"*sniff, blow...hic*"
<es>

@854
<en>I made her cry. Maybe I got too excited.
<es>

@855
<en>{Kazushi}\n"S-sorry! I didn't think you were crying."
<es>

@856
<en>{Natsume}\n"I said "Stop.""
<es>

@857

<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, death penalty."
<es>

@861
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Th-the death penalty? That's harsh."
<es>

@864
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wah... *sniff*"
<es>

@865
<en>It really got to me when she told me I should be executed as she cried.
<es>

@866
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm really sorry. I'll buy you an ice cream. Would you forgive me if I did that?"
<es>

@869
<en>{Natsume}\n"......"
<es>

@870
<en>Natsume-chan still looked upset, and continued ignoring me. I was going to have to actually buy one and give it to her. Did Miya-san sell ice cream at his shop?
<es>

@872
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya-san! Give me an ice cream!"
<es>

@873
<en>Silence.
<es>

@874
<en>No answer. Maybe he's not here.
<es>

@875
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, this sucks. We can't buy anything if he's not here."
<es>

@878
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ice cream..."
<es>

@879
<en>Now Natsume-chan was asking for an ice cream flat out. Was there any other place that sold ice cream?
<es>

@880
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh! How about that?"
<es>

@882
<en>The grocer was selling cut fruit frozen on a stick. It was about the same price as ice cream too.
<es>

@883
<en>It was a bit unusual, but the girls seemed to dig it.
<es>

@884
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? Doesn't it look good? Let's get that!"
<es>

@885
<en>I held Natsume-chan's hand and walked her to the grocery store.
<es>

@886
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Look. What do you want? Get whatever you like."
<es>

@889
<en>{Natsume}\n"......Pineapple."
<es>

@890
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, pops! A frozen pineapple, please!"
<es>

@892
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Coming right up! Oh, it's you, Kazushi. What, on a date today?"
<es>

@893
<en>The man at the grocery store looked at Natsume-chan, and made a comment. I'd been here a few times before, so we got to know each other.
<es>

@894
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, it's nothing like that."
<es>

@895
<en>I paid him, and took the frozen pineapple.
<es>

@896
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Here, Natsume-chan. Please forgive me!"
<es>

@899
<en>I begged her forgiveness, and offered her the pineapple. Natsume-chan accepted it without saying anything, and...
<es>

@902
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ok, fine."
<es>

@903
<en>She mumbled like that. That released me from her hatred, so I guess she's decided to forgive me.
<es>

@904
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"What? Are you trying to make your girlfriend feel better with this cheap stuff? What a worthless man."
<es>

@905
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry. And she's not my girlfriend."
<es>

@906
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Don't you let him trick you with this cheap stuff, lady. You have to make him buy you that melon or something like that."
<es>

@907
<en>The man pointed at a huge, expensive melon in an ornate wooden box. It cost 15,000 yen.
<es>

@908
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Geh?! I can't buy that. And you're definitely overcharging for it!"
<es>

@909
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"What are you talking about? See, Miss? I'm sure you want to eat that sweet melon, don't you?"
<es>

@910
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Mm? What?"
<es>

@913
<en>Suddenly, the man stopped talking. He was tilting his head and looking at Natsume-chan.
<es>

@914
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@915
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Well, uhh..."
<es>

@916
<en>{Natsume}\n"...... I'm going to look at the ocean."
<es>

@921
<en>Natsume-chan ran to the waterfront to avoid the man's rude stares.
<es>

@922
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't go too close to the edge! Be careful not to slip off the cliff!"
<es>

@923
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, what are you doing, man? She got upset again and ran away."
<es>

@924
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Sorry about that, but I thought I'd seen her before..."
<es>

@925
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? You know her?"
<es>

@926
<en>I didn't know anything about Natsume-chan at that point, including how she showed up like that, where she came from, and why she was here now...
<es>

@927
<en>And then there was her father...
<es>

@928
<en>We didn't know anything, and nobody was willing to tell us about her. Natsume-chan wasn't saying anything, and she always dodged the issue, so we weren't asking her, either.
<es>

@929
<en>But this guy might know something about her?
<es>

@930
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"Oh, yeah. There was a girl who said she was looking for her father, must've been a few years ago. She looks like that girl."
<es>

@931
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Her father?"
<es>

@932
<en>It was few years ago? But Natsume-chan's supposed to be a freshman. It must be someone who looked like her?
<es>

@933
<en>{Grocery Store Worker}\n"It was a few years back, so I'm not so sure. But your girlfriend sure is a cutie."
<es>

@934
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm telling you, it's not like that!"
<es>

@935
<en>A few years ago... I was sure he couldn't have been talking about her, but I couldn't forget his story.
<es>

@942
<en>{Appo}\n"And so you came back without buying anything at all?"
<es>

@943
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, Miya-san wasn't there."
<es>

@944
<en>I called for him a few times, but he wasn't home. He must've been out somewhere.
<es>

@945
<en>{Appo}\n"I didn't think he ever closed the store. I go all the time with Kazuko, and he's never been closed."
<es>

@946
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe it's for summer break, or maybe it's for the Bon Festival."
<es>

@949
<en>{Appo}\n"Well, maybe it's for the better. You can go by yourself to buy them, and then give 'em to her as a gift. What do you think?"
<es>

@950
<en>...every once in a while, Appo actually says something good.
<es>

@951
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, that's a great idea! Do you think Natsume-chan would like that?"
<es>

@954
<en>{Appo}\n"Definitely. All girls like surprises."
<es>

@955
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK! I'll go by myself tomorrow to get them!"
<es>

@956
<en>As I imagined Natsume-chan's happy surprise, I couldn't wait for tomorrow. I hope it comes soon.
<es>
