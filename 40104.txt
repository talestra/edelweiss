<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume! Do you want to go?"
<es>

@9
<en>I called out loud to find her. In the middle of summer vacation, the campus is as quiet as it can be.
<es>

@16
<en>I walked around listening to my own footsteps. Inside of the building was cool without air conditioning and it was nice.
<es>

@17
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe I should take a nap here."
<es>

@18
<en>It was cool and could be a best spot.
<es>

@19
<en>{Cat}\n"Meow"
<es>

@21
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@22
<en>It was a sound of a cat. There was a cat on campus?
<es>

@23
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder where it could be? Meow? Meow?"
<es>

@24
<en>I called out for a cat, imitating their sound.
<es>

@25
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mee? Meow?"
<es>

@26
<en>{Cat}\n"Meow. Meow."
<es>

@27
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, she's answering."
<es>

@28
<en>The cat answered. So, there is a cat somewhere.
<es>

@29
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Meow? Meow, meow."
<es>

@30
<en>{Cat}\n"Mee. Mee. Mee."
<es>

@31
<en>I followed the cry of the cat. It sounded like it was coming from freshman's class room.
<es>

@32
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Meow? Meow?"
<es>

@33
<en>{Cat?}\n"Zzz"
<es>

@34
<en>Zzz? That does not sound like a cat? What kind of a cat is it?
<es>

@35
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Better be quiet..."
<es>

@37
<en>I opened the door slowly, not to surprise the cat.
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where are you? Meow? Meow?"
<es>

@41
<en>{Cat}\n"Meow."
<es>

@42
<en>The cry came from under the desk by the window. I tip-toed to get close to the desk.
<es>

@43
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Meow?"
<es>

@44
<en>I cried to look under the desk.
<es>

@48
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@49
<en>There was a huge cat. She was sleeping surrounded by some real cats.
<es>

@50
<en>Natsume, there you are. But what are you doing?
<es>

@51
<en>Is this some kind of costume play? I remember that Sakura has said something about changing cloth or something. So, this was what they were talking about.
<es>

@52
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sakura made you wear this."
<es>

@53
<en>Maybe that why Natsume ran away. And she came into the school building. That's when she felt asleep hiding under the desk.
<es>

@54
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But..."
<es>

@55
<en>{Cat}\n"Meow"
<es>

@56
<en>Look at all these cats. Is she a cat person? Or maybe the cat ears she's wearing?
<es>

@58
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@59
<en>Natsume frowns her eyebrows because a cat is sleeping on her chest. But she looks cute with that kind of facial expressions.
<es>

@60
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, shit. I may be wondering into illicit path."
<es>

@61
<en>This kind of play will get to you. Well, it's not a play...but...
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Should I wake her up?"
<es>

@63
<en>I can't let her sleep like this for long.
<es>

@64
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume, Natsume! It's morning!!"
<es>

@65
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume! Natsume!!"
<es>

@67
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@68
<en>Her long eye lashes are moving. She might be waking up soon.
<es>

@69
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume! You got to wake up! Sakura is coming to get you!"
<es>

@70
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@71
<en>She moans and opened her eyes slowly.
<es>

@73
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm... Kazushi?"
<es>

@74
<en>She looked at me with sleepy eyes.
<es>

@75
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's Kazushi. Don't sleep here. Go back to your room and sleep."
<es>

@76
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@77
<en>She's moaning. She sounds like she's in bad mood. Is it because she just woke up? She is scratching her eyes.
<es>

@78
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, hey. Don't rub your eyes too much. Is your hands clean? You can get a virus if you scratch with dirty hands."
<es>

@80
<en>I try to stop her from scratching her eyes. She gave me a bad look still looking sleepy.
<es>

@81
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm... You always get in my way."
<es>

@82
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, that's not true. Come on. Wake up."
<es>

@84
<en>{Natsume}\n"Zzz..."
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't go back to sleep."
<es>

@86
<en>She is just like a spoiled little sister. I can't leave her alone.
<es>

@88
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm.. Kazushi, you woke me up today. It's the opposite of the last time."
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean? Opposite?"
<es>

@90
<en>{Natsume}\n"You better not have kissed me this time."
<es>

@91
<en>Natsume made some weird comment, and wiped her lips. I thought I saw blood on her hand, but it was an illusion.
<es>

@92
<en>Why blood? Isn't it too weird for an illusion?
<es>

@93
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What about the kiss? I didn't kiss you when you were sleeping!"
<es>

@94
<en>{Natsume}\n"How dare you. Well, I guess it doesn't make any difference if it's once or twice."
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I've never kiss you before."
<es>

@96
<en>Because I have never kissed in my life. Not that I'm proud of it.
<es>

@97
<en>{Natsume}\n"Anyway, I'm glad you are here. Could you go get my cloth? I can't go out like this."
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. I guess."
<es>

@99
<en>If she goes out like this, she might be abducted by some crazy maniac person.
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, wait here."
<es>

@101
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'll be going back to sleep until then."
<es>

@102
<en>She's going back to sleep? I better hurry.
<es>

@113
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hey, she's changed? That's too bad."
<es>

@116
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, a little bit."
<es>

@117
<en>I have asked Sakura and Mizuki to get Natsume's cloth. I felt awkward to go into the girl's dorm.
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She sure did look good with that. That's too bad."
<es>

@121
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh man! You such Lolita lover."
<es>

@124
<en>{Natsume}\n"You like that?"
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not like that! Don't make that kind of comments."
<es>

@128
<en>{Natsume}\n"That's why you look at me with that insistent look."
<es>

@131
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh my god. I thought you are a nice guy..."
<es>

@132
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am a nice guy!"
<es>

@133
<en>{Sakura}\n"We should ignore him next semester. When he comes back to school, he'll have a vase with a chrysanthemum in it on his desk, and no one will talk to him."
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No! Please don't do that!!"
<es>

@135
<en>It makes me shiver thinking about it.
<es>

@138
<en>{Natsume}\n"Sakura, you are a mean girl. Don't come close to me."
<es>

@143
<en>{Sakura}\n"I'm just joking. I'm a nice big sister. I'll bring more cute cloth for you, OK?"
<es>

@146
<en>{Natsume}\n"No. I'm not wearing it anymore."
<es>

@147
<en>Natsume seems to be upset. I'm not on Sakura's side or anything, but she did look good in that cloth...
<es>

@148
<en>I'm not Lolita lover thought.
<es>

@151
<en>{Mizuki}\n"See? Natsume's upset. Because you forced her to wear it, Sakura!"
<es>

@154
<en>{Sakura}\n"Well, then we can try nurse next time?"
<es>

@155
<en>{Natsume}\n"You are not listening."
<es>

@156
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not about if she looks good or not. By the way, how do you get all these cloth?"
<es>

@159
<en>{Sakura}\n"I have a secret route. Do you want to know about it?"
<es>

@160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. I'm not interested."
<es>

@161
<en>I don't have anyone to wear it for me. No, that's not the problem.
<es>

@164
<en>{Natsume}\n"Anyway, don't come close to me, Sakura. No more than 2 meters."
<es>

@167
<en>{Sakura}\n"What? Seriously?"
<es>

@170
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You brought that on your self. You better be sorry."
<es>

@175
<en>{Sakura}\n"OK, fine. So, don't hate me."
<es>

@176
<en>Sakura tries to hug Natsume. But she slipped away and hid behind Mizuki's back.
<es>

@183
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Stop that. She's so scary, huh?"
<es>

@186
<en>{Natsume}\n"..."
<es>

@187
<en>She is nodding. I guess Natsume is scared of Sakura.
<es>

@190
<en>{Sakura}\n"But, talk about scary person, that will be Kazushi. He is your natural enemy."
<es>

@191
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why would I be her natural enemy?"
<es>

@194
<en>{Sakura}\n"You are Lolita lover. That's scary. Didn't he attack you?"
<es>

@195
<en>She said it jokingly. But, Natsume nodded seriously.
<es>

@198
<en>{Natsume}\n"He didn't do anything today."
<es>

@203
<en>{Sakura & Mizuki}\n"What? Today??"
<es>

@204
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you talking about? I've never done anything like that!"
<es>

@205
<en>{Natsume}\n"You did."
<es>

@206
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What did I do?"
<es>

@209
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? What did he do?"
<es>

@212
<en>{Natsume}\n"He acted like he was sleeping and when I came close to him, he kissed me."
<es>

@213
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, hey, hey!"
<es>

@218
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh my god!!"
<es>

@219
<en>What are they excited about? But that's not the problem.
<es>

@220
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume, I'm telling you! I don't know anything about it!!"
<es>

@223
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yes, you did."
<es>

@226
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, what an asshole! It's not fair to attack someone acting like you are in sleep!"
<es>

@227
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No! That's is a misunderstanding! I don't do anything like that!"
<es>

@230
<en>{Natsume}\n"Well, It's fine. I will think of it as a stray dog bit me."
<es>

@231
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A stray dog... But, I'm telling you, I didn't do that!"
<es>

@234
<en>{Sakura}\n"You shouldn't cry about it! We should take it to the court and fight it!"
<es>

@235
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, a court? Hold on."
<es>

@238
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Shut up, asshole! Go home!"
<es>

@241
<en>{Sakura}\n"The death penalty!"
<es>

@242
<en>They made me such an criminal in short while.
<es>

@245
<en>{Natsume}\n"Yeah, death penalty!"
<es>

@246
<en>Natsume's voice sounded happy.
<es>

@247
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume, are you having fun with this?"
<es>

@250
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shut up, asshole!"
<es>

@251
<en>She sure looks like she's having fun. She must be having fun. Well, It's fine if she's happy.
<es>

@252
<en>Am I serious?
<es>

@263
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I thought you won't do anything like that."
<es>

@266
<en>{Sakura}\n"Kazushi is actually a nice person despite of how he looks."
<es>

@267
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean? How do I look?"
<es>

@270
<en>{Sakura}\n"A depressed young man?"
<es>

@271
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess it's not too far away from the truth."
<es>

@272
<en>But, I guess we clear that misunderstanding, and that's good.
<es>

@275
<en>{Natsume}\n"Why are you two so upset? It's not your business if Kazushi kissed me or not?"
<es>

@278
<en>{Sakura}\n"We can't let it go. And it is kind of our business."
<es>

@281
<en>{Mizuki}\n"We can't add more victims of Kazushi."
<es>

@282
<en>Mm.. Mizuki must have some grudge still. Well, it's inevitable.
<es>

@285
<en>{Natsume}\n"I think everybody is too hyped up about Kazushi."
<es>

@286
<en>Natsume is so cool about it, compare to those two.
<es>

@289
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But, wouldn't you hate it if he did something to you?"
<es>

@290
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm telling you I don't do that!"
<es>

@293
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't care. I can't let just Kazushi ruin everything, you know?"
<es>

@294
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean, just?"
<es>

@295
<en>Sakura and Mizuki are looking at each other being confused.
<es>

@298
<en>{Sakura}\n"So..."
<es>

@299
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's OK with you if Kazushi does something to you?"
<es>

@300
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't care."
<es>

@303
<en>{Sakura}\n"Then, what about me?"
<es>

@304
<en>Sakura looks very excited. Natsume is offended.
<es>

@307
<en>{Natsume}\n"... You better stop that kind of joke. I'll make you cry."
<es>

@310
<en>{Sakura}\n"...."
<es>

@311
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Stop that. Hey, Sakura!"
<es>

@312
<en>{Sakura}\n"Mm.. This..."
<es>

@318
<en>Sakura and Mizuki are talking about something.
<es>

@323
<en>{Sakura}\n"So, do you think so?"
<es>

@324
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Not just thinking but actually..."
<es>

@325
<en>They are whispering so I can't hear but they seems to agree on something.
<es>

@326
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, what are you talking about?"
<es>

@327
<en>They were talking about something, but came back after a while. Then, they looked into Natsume's eye.
<es>

@334
<en>{Sakura}\n"Natsume, do you like Kazushi?"
<es>

@335
<en>......
<es>

@336
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh!? What are you talking about!?"
<es>

@339
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hold on. Let us handle this."
<es>

@340
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean?"
<es>

@343
<en>{Sakura}\n"So, what do you think? Do you like him?"
<es>

@344
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm..? I never thought about it. Why?"
<es>

@347
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well, Kazushi said he likes you. So, what do you want to do?"
<es>

@348
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, you guys!"
<es>

@349
<en>What are they talking about? They are ignoring my feelings and the wheels of fate is starting to roll.
<es>

@350
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, hold on. What are you talking about?"
<es>

@353
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Calm down! You better take the responsibility. You know? The responsibility."
<es>

@354
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What about the responsibility? I haven't done anything."
<es>

@357
<en>{Sakura}\n"How about you Natsume? Do you want him to take the responsibility?"
<es>

@360
<en>{Natsume}\n"The responsibility? Mm.."
<es>

@361
<en>Natsume thought for a while and nodded like a toy.
<es>

@364
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wow, fabulous! I saw the moment of love!"
<es>

@365
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, she doesn't understand what the responsibility means!"
<es>

@366
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't even understand. What kind of responsibility are we talking about?"
<es>

@371
<en>{Sakura}\n"That doesn't matter now. You guys should date!"
<es>

@372
<en>A whisper of a devil. What a nice smile she has.
<es>

@373
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you saying. It's unfair..."
<es>

@376
<en>{Sakura}\n"But if you be fair, you can't have a girlfriend, ever."
<es>

@377
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you serious?"
<es>

@378
<en>I've tried to be fair all along, and I did not have a girlfriend. So that was what's wrong with me?
<es>

@381
<en>{Sakura}\n"You know? Natsume seems to like the idea. She's always hanging out with you."
<es>

@386
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, so the love exist now? Or no?"
<es>

@387
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No. Not yet."
<es>

@390
<en>{Sakura}\n"Then, it'll come soon. Huh? Natsume?"
<es>

@396
<en>Sakura is calling Natsume, and...
<es>

@399
<en>{Sakura}\n"Kazushi said he likes you so he wants you to be his girlfriend."
<es>

@402
<en>I can't believe she said that.
<es>

@403
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey!! What are you saying?"
<es>

@406
<en>{Sakura}\n"It's OK. It's OK."
<es>

@407
<en>Sakura is waiting for Natsume's answer like it wasn't any of her concern. Natsume looked at me for a while and she looked down.
<es>

@411
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'm sorry."
<es>

@412
<en>She bowed politely and said so. I felt all the energy drain out of me as soon as I saw that.
<es>

@418
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? The love didn't exist?"
<es>

@419
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh shit. I guess it didn't work."
<es>

@420
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't laugh!"
<es>

@421
<en>She denied me. What is this empty feeling?
<es>

@422
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why do I have to be embarrassed like this? I didn't even say I like her. What are you going to do about this?"
<es>

@425
<en>{Sakura}\n"Well, we wished for the best. But we didn't think she'll reject you. For real!"
<es>

@426
<en>I have no idea what they knew. But, Sakura seems to believe it would work out for real. Of course, nothing is that easy.
<es>

@429
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So, what didn't you like about Kazushi? Of course, he's not so bright, he is a pervert, he's not so handsome, or charming, but not too bad... Well, I see what you mean."
<es>

@430
<en>She was making a list out loud and came to a conclusion on her own. That is unspeakable!
<es>

@437
<en>{Natsume}\n"I just can't do that."
<es>

@440
<en>{Sakura}\n"Huh? Why? Why? Do you happen to like girls, Natsume?"
<es>

@441
<en>{Natsume}\n"I can't stay long."
<es>

@442
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Can't stay long?"
<es>

@445
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What do you mean?"
<es>

@448
<en>{Sakura}\n"What do you mean by that? Are you going somewhere?"
<es>

@449
<en>Natsume was attacked by all the questions and she frowned like it made her upset.
<es>

@452
<en>{Natsume}\n"Don't ask me everything. Why don't you use your head."
<es>

@453
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm asking you because I don't understand it."
<es>

@459
<en>{Natsume}\n".l..."
<es>

@460
<en>She turned on her back and not answering anymore.
<es>

@463
<en>{Sakura}\n"Is Natsume going somewhere? See? You need to hold on to her, so that she won't go anywhere, Kazushi?"
<es>

@464

<es>

@467
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What a wuss."
<es>

@468
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's not my fault. I can't make everything happen all by myself."
<es>

@469
<en>I could try if I can change it. But, Natsume seems to be bothered by me, and I can't force it upon her.
<es>

@470
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, so she did reject me..."
<es>

@471
<en>The fact that she didn't take me in is affecting me now. So, she did reject me...
<es>

@474
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wow. Kazushi? You look pale."
<es>

@475
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I can't take it. The fact that I'm being rejected is affecting me."
<es>

@478
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Are you OK? What are we going to do, Sakura?"
<es>

@481
<en>{Sakura}\n"What? Sorry... Well, then... Do you want to go out with me?"
<es>

@488
<en>{Natsume}\n".....??"
<es>

@494
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Is that?? Do you like Kazushi?"
<es>

@495
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you serious?"
<es>

@500
<en>{Natsume}\n"....??"
<es>

@506
<en>{Sakura}\n"Don't be so surprised, guys. Well, I don't hate Kazushi. And he barely pass my standard, but he is Ok."
<es>

@507
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I barely pass your standard?"
<es>

@508
<en>So, she doesn't really like me. Is she feeling sorry for me? I'm probably worth less than I thought.
<es>

@511
<en>{Sakura}\n"But, it's Ok. It's kind of fun to chose a summer time lover like that."
<es>

@512
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can't be serious. You should take care of yourself better."
<es>

@517
<en>{Natsume}\n"...."
<es>

@518
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? Natsume think so too."
<es>

@524
<en>{Sakura}\n"Shut up! I have decided! I'm going to date Kazushi!"
<es>

@525
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You have decided?"
<es>

@528
<en>{Sakura}\n"I'm beginning to think this is the greatest idea ever! So, Hello! Kazushi!"
<es>

@529
<en>She decided all by herself, and cling to my arm.
<es>

@532
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So, you have love now?"
<es>

@533
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, no, no."
<es>

@536
<en>{Sakura}\n"Kazushi! Yeah, I'm getting used to it. It might be a great idea for real."
<es>

@537
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you serious?"
<es>

@541
<en>Am I going to date Sakura for real? What am I going to do?
<es>

@546
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@547
<en>Something made a huge noise next to me.
<es>

@552
<en>{Sakura}\n"Huh???"
<es>

@553
<en>Sakura was like a marionette without a string. White of the eye is showing.
<es>

@560
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Natsume?"
<es>

@561
<en>Natsume had a frying pan in her hand. Where did she get this?
<es>

@562
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, no. Did you use that? Sakura? Are you Ok?"
<es>

@563
<en>{Sakura}\n"Huh???"
<es>

@564
<en>Maybe not.
<es>

@565
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sakura? Hey, Sakura? This is bad."
<es>

@566
<en>{Natsume}\n"You can't come closer than 3 meters to Kazushi and I, Sakura!"
<es>

@567
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't think she can hear that."
<es>

@568
<en>{Sakura}\n"Huh???"
<es>

@573
<en>We took her to nurse's office and put her to bed.
<es>

@574
<en>The wound was not too bad and they treated her with oral medicine and some ointment made with special herb mixture.
<es>

@577
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Don't worry, this works the best. I used it when I cut my leg in the rocks. It only took one night to heal it."
<es>

@578
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok. So, it should be fine then."
<es>

@580
<en>{Sakura}\n"Zzz"
<es>

@581
<en>Sakura is calm now and sleeping well. Natsume is looking into Sakura on the bed.
<es>

@585
<en>{Natsume}\n"..."
<es>

@586
<en>She started to draw a mustache with a pen.
<es>

@587
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey! You can't draw on people's face, especially when they are sleeping."
<es>

@588
<en>{Natsume}\n"Why? Look, this mustache is so cool."
<es>

@589
<en>Sakura had a dandy mustache already.
<es>

@590
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can't do that even if it's cool. Sakura is out of it because of you. Do you understand what you did?"
<es>

@593
<en>{Natsume}\n"...... Yeah."
<es>

@594
<en>Looks like she is feeling guilty.
<es>

@595
<en>{Natsume}\n"I took some part."
<es>

@596
<en>Some part?
<es>

@597
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can't hit someone with a frying pan from behind, ever! Ok?"
<es>

@598
<en>{Natsume}\n"I won't do that again. I just got little upset."
<es>

@599
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can't do that even if you get upset. Promise?"
<es>

@600
<en>It seems childish, but I made her swear.
<es>

@603
<en>{Natsume}\n"I got it. Don't rub it in."
<es>

@608
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So, you understand it, Natsume. Sakura must be happy in heaven."
<es>

@609
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She's alive. It's kind of like a wake, surrounding her like this."
<es>

@612
<en>{Sakura}\n"Zzz"
<es>

@613
<en>She sure sleeps well. Natsume sat on the chair next to Sakura's bed as she looked down on her face.
<es>

@616
<en>{Natsume}\n"I'll stay here so you can go."
<es>

@617
<en>She is willing to stay until Sakura wakes up. She must be feeling guilty.
<es>

@618
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll be here too."
<es>

@619
<en>I grabbed a chair and sat next to Natsume.
<es>

@623
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Well, then I should be leaving?"
<es>

@624
<en>Mizuki is still standing up and trying to decide if she should sit down as well. She looks restless and looking around.
<es>

@625
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't think anything weird. But, we'll be here, so if you want to go..."
<es>

@629
<en>{Natsume}\n"......."
<es>

@633
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Are you sure? Then I guess I'll leave it up to you guys..."
<es>

@636
<en>She put on forced smile and ran out the nurse's office. What is she thinking?
<es>

@639
<en>{Natsume}\n"........"
<es>

@640
<en>Natsume is looking at Sakura's sleeping face. But, I felt like she was thinking about me.
<es>

@641
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh. Should I leave as well?"
<es>

@642
<en>I just remembered that she rejected me just a moment ago. I forgot in all these happenings.
<es>

@643
<en>Why would I remember that now?
<es>

@644
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll leave if you want me to."
<es>

@647
<en>{Natsume}\n"....."
<es>

@648
<en>But, Natsume shook her head. I guess it's OK for me to stay.
<es>

@649
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't want you to leave."
<es>

@650
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah? If you say so. But, you rejected me while ago."
<es>

@653
<en>{Natsume}\n"I didn't reject you."
<es>

@654
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? But..."
<es>

@655
<en>She did say "I'm sorry". Isn't it rejecting?
<es>

@658
<en>{Natsume}\n"Because I'm a shadow. That's why I can't answer. I said "I'm sorry"for not being able to answer."
<es>

@659
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@660
<en>She said "I'm sorry"for not being able to answer? I don't understand.
<es>

@661
<en>But, I guess she didn't reject me after all. By the way, what is a shadow?
<es>

@662
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean by shadow?"
<es>

@665
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't know. Don't ask me everything. You should think with your head."
<es>

@666
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am, but this is confusing."
<es>

@667
<en>A shadow... What does she mean? A shadow and a light?
<es>

@668
<en>If Natsume is a shadow, then where is the light?
<es>

@671
<en>{Natsume}\n"....."
<es>

@672
<en>But, Natsume doesn't seems like she is willing to answer me. She looks mad and looking at Sakura's face.
<es>

@674
<en>That moment, I felt like Natsume is going to vanish just like that. Her existence is somewhat vague.
<es>

@675
<en>Come to think of it, the way she showed up was unrealistic. It was like her existence is not rooted in this world.
<es>

@676
<en>She might vanish if you look away...
<es>

@677
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then I'll think about it myself. I should be able to get the answer if I really think about it?"
<es>

@678
<en>I want more common ground with her. I want to know more about her. If I can get to know her better by thinking about it, then I will think as hard as I can.
<es>

@681
<en>{Natsume}\n"You don't have to think. You already know."
<es>

@682
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Really?"
<es>

@683
<en>It confuses me. I already know?
<es>

@685
<en>{Sakura}\n"Wow! Give my saddle back!"
<es>

@686
<en>Sakura's voice shut my thoughts. I thought she woke up, but it was her sleep talk.
<es>

@687
<en>{Sakura}\n"We can't finish if we don't have a saddle."
<es>

@688
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is she finishing?"
<es>

@691
<en>{Natsume}\n"Sakura's an idiot even in her sleep."
<es>

@692
<en>We looked at Sakura still in her sleep. What should I do? How should I talk to Natsume?
<es>

@693
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Can I stay close to you, Natsume? If you don't mind. Can we still hang out like we used to?"
<es>

@696
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't mind."
<es>

@697
<en>That was a plain answer, but it made me relaxed. So, we can still hang out like we used to.
<es>

@698
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok. So, it is."
<es>

@699
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ok."
<es>

@700
<en>It seems like a lot of things happen, but nothing happened as a result.
<es>

@701
<en>However, it must be different than just standing still.
<es>

@702
<en>We went forward and came back to the same place, but we did make some steps. Maybe I'm more close to her that much.
<es>

@703
<en>But, more things became confusing as I got closer.
<es>

@707
<en>{Natsume}\n"....."
<es>

@708
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't write that mustache."
<es>

@715
<en>{Sakura}\n"The dead dog said not this side."
<es>

@716
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That sound pretty bad. What about the saddle? Did she finish?"
<es>

@719
<en>{Sakura}\n"What? What are you talking about?"
<es>

@720
<en>Doesn't she remember the dream? Well, it's nice that she came back.
<es>

@722
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I told you that the life is very important. Don't do anything like that anymore. Ok?"
<es>

@723
<en>I preached to Natsume who is sitting next to me.
<es>

@726
<en>{Natsume}\n"Mm..."
<es>

@728
<en>She wasn't really listening. She can't get the butter corn with the chopsticks.
<es>

@729
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Who taught you to use the chopstick?"
<es>

@732
<en>{Natsume}\n"Shut up."
<es>

@737
<en>{Rin}\n"Isn't that chopsticks too long for you, Natsume?"
<es>

@744
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, yeah. That's a cafeteria's chopsticks. Don't you have your own?"
<es>

@748
<en>She was using a chopsticks which is provided by the cafeteria.
<es>

@749
<en>All the boys are using this chopsticks, but the girls bring their own to cafeteria.
<es>

@750
<en>I guess they hate the thought of using the same chopsticks with the boys even if they wash it every time.
<es>

@751
<en>So the girls bought their own before we came in.
<es>

@752
<en>All the guys don't care about that at all, so we use these chopsticks, but Natsume didn't have her own either.
<es>

@757
<en>{Haruka}\n"It may be too long for you. Do you want to go buy your chopsticks tomorrow? I'll show you the town as well."
<es>

@760
<en>{Sakura}\n"Why don't you ask Kazushi to take her? Wouldn't you like that better, Natsume?"
<es>

@765
<en>{Natsume}\n"I guess. Kazushi, take me."
<es>

@766
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you sure?"
<es>

@767
<en>{Natsume}\n"..... Yeah."
<es>

@768
<en>I guess I don't have a reason to say no.
<es>

@769
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok! Let's go tomorrow."
<es>

@770
<en>{Natsume}\n"....."
<es>

@774
<en>{Haruka}\n"Do you want to use my bike? You have to push it to come back, but the down hill is so fast!"
<es>

@778
<en>{Natsume}\n"I can't ride bike."
<es>

@779
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really? Then you can sit in the back. Let's borrow the bike!"
<es>

@782
<en>{Natsume}\n"! ....!"
<es>

@783
<en>She is nodding like crazy. She seems to be curious about it. I'm so looking forward to it.
<es>

@789
<en>We came into the downhill with such a force.
<es>

@790
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You better hang on!"
<es>

@791
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wow, wow."
<es>

@792
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wow?"
<es>

@793
<en>I leaned forward, and the speed is picking up. I'm still pedaling as hard as I could.
<es>

@794
<en>The bike is running faster and faster.
<es>

@795
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wow!!"
<es>

@796
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, hang on tight!"
<es>

@797
<en>She was just putting her hands on my shoulder, so I told her to hang on tight.
<es>

@798
<en>It felt like a warm small creature is sitting against my back. It was a relaxing feeling.
<es>

@799
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok! Let's go faster!"
<es>

@800
<en>{Natsume}\n"Even more?"
<es>

@801
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Even more!!"
<es>

@804
<en>I pedaled some more. We were going so fast, it was hard to tell if we were going down hill or we were falling.
<es>

@805
<en>The landscape on both sides are falling back in unbelievable speed.
<es>

@806
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wow, wow?"
<es>

@807
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's like a rollercoaster, huh?"
<es>

@808
<en>{Natsume}\n".....!"
<es>

@809
<en>She clutched her hands. I felt it as a token of her trust and made me feel good.
<es>

@810
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It feels great!! Do you want to practice, so that you can ride a bike?"
<es>

@811
<en>{Natsume}\n"....No. I'll ask you."
<es>

@812
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It'll be so much fun to ride it on your own!"
<es>

@813
<en>{Natsume}\n"No. You ride it."
<es>

@814
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm the driver? I guess it's fine with me. Isn't it unusual not to be able to ride a bike?"
<es>

@815
<en>{Natsume}\n"My mom didn't ride it. No one taught me."
<es>

@816
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How about your dad?"
<es>

@817
<en>Isn't it a father's responsibility?
<es>

@818
<en>{Natsume}\n"My dad...."
<es>

@819
<en>As soon as I asked her about her father, she stopped talking. It was a gloomy silence.
<es>

@820
<en>Is it something I shouldn't have asked?
<es>

@821
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, ask me anytime you want to ride a bike. I come to get you."
<es>

@822
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ok, I'll do that."
<es>

@823
<en>I guess something is going on. It'll make me happy if she talks to me about whatever the problem she has someday.
<es>

@824
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow."
<es>

@825
<en>At that moment, we saw a sparkling ocean in front of us.
<es>

@826
<en>The blue ocean is reflecting the sun and it looked like the ocean was sprinkling countless jewels all over the place.
<es>

@827
<en>I felt like we were diving into the ocean as we went downhill toward it.
<es>

@828
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume! Look! In front of us!"
<es>

@829
<en>Natsume moved her head and looked over my shoulder. She opened her eyes into the blowing wind and looked at the view under us.
<es>

@830
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wow, Ocean? A sky?"
<es>

@831
<en>As we went downhill, there was a blue sky and an ocean. It was hard to tell where the ocean end and the sky started.
<es>

@832
<en>{Natsume}\n"It's like flying."
<es>

@833
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah!!"
<es>

@834
<en>I felt like my body is becoming in pieces as the wind blew hard on us.
<es>

@835
<en>I felt like I was torn into small pieces and melt into the air. It was almost like flying in the air.
<es>

@836
<en>{Natsume}\n"This is great! It feels good!"
<es>

@837
<en>Natsume sounded excited. Maybe it was a first time I heard her like that.
<es>

@838
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ok! Then let's go faster!!"
<es>

@839
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wow..."
<es>

@842
<en>I stood up from the saddle. I stepped on the pedal as hard as I could to make it fly.
<es>

@843
<en>{Natsume}\n"Wait. Stop, stop."
<es>

@844
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not yet!"
<es>

@845
<en>{Natsume}\n"No! No!"
<es>

@846
<en>We became a wind.
<es>

@853
<en>{Natsume}\n"Crying"
<es>

@854
<en>I made her cry. Maybe I got too excited.
<es>

@855
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry! I didn't think you were crying."
<es>

@856
<en>{Natsume}\n"I said "Stop"."
<es>

@857
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I couldn't hear because of the wind. I did stop if I heard you."
<es>

@860
<en>{Natsume}\n"Death penalty to you, Kazushi."
<es>

@861
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Death penalty? That's harsh."
<es>

@864
<en>{Natsume}\n"Crying"
<es>

@865
<en>It got to me when she told me the death penalty with crying face.
<es>

@866
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm really sorry. I'll buy you an ice cream. Can you forgive me if I did that?"
<es>

@869
<en>{Natsume}\n"....."
<es>

@870
<en>Natsume still looks upset and ignores me. I have to actually buy an ice cream and present it to her to make her feel better. Did Miya-san sell an ice cream?
<es>

@872
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya-san! Give me an ice cream!"
<es>

@873
<en>Silence
<es>

@874
<en>No answer. Maybe he's not here.
<es>

@875
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, man. We can't buy it, if he's not here."
<es>

@878
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ice cream...."
<es>

@879
<en>Natsume is asking for an ice cream now. Is there any other place sells an ice cream?
<es>

@880
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh! How about that?"
<es>

@882
<en>I found a grocery store which sold frozen fruits on a stick. And it doesn't cost much more than an ice cream.
<es>

@883
<en>It was unusual and maybe the girls dig it.

<en>{Kazushi}\n"See? Doesn't it look good? Let's get that!"
<es>

@885
<en>I hold Natsume's hand and walked her to the grocery store.
<es>

@886
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Look. What do you want? Get whatever you like."
<es>

@889
<en>{Natsume}\n"..... Pineapple."
<es>

@890
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Excuse me! I'll get this frozen pineapple!"
<es>

@892
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Thank you! Oh, hey, Kazushi. What? Are you on a date?"
<es>

@893
<en>The man at the grocery store looks at Natsume and makes a comment. I've been here few times before, so we got to know each other.
<es>

@894
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, nothing like that."
<es>

@895
<en>I paid him and got the frozen pineapple.
<es>

@896
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Natsume, I'm really sorry!"
<es>

@899
<en>I begged her, and gave her the pineapple. Natsume received it without saying anything, and...
<es>

@902
<en>{Natsume}\n"Ok, fine."
<es>

@903
<en>She mumbled like that. That made me released. I guess she's decided to forgive me.
<es>

@904
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"What? Are you trying to make your girlfriend feel better with this cheap stuff? What a worthless man."
<es>

@905
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shut up. And she is not my girlfriend."
<es>

@906
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Don't you let him trick you with this cheap stuff. You have to make him buy you that melon or something like that."
<es>

@907
<en>The man pointed at the expensive, huge melon in a paulownia box. It cost Fifteen thousand yen.
<es>

@908
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shit!? Do you expect me to buy that? You must be over pricing it!"
<es>

@909
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"What are you talking about? See, miss? I'm sure you want to eat that sweet melon, don't you?"
<es>

@910
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Mm? What?"
<es>

@913
<en>The man shut up suddenly. He is tilting his head looking at Natsume.
<es>

@914
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What happened?"
<es>

@915
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Mm, yeah..."
<es>

@916
<en>{Natsume}\n"..... I'm going to look at the ocean."
<es>

@921
<en>Natsume ran to the ocean to avoid the stare of the man.
<es>

@922
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, don't go too close to the edge! Be careful not to slip off the cliff!"
<es>

@923
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, what are you doing, man? She got pissed again and ran away."
<es>

@924
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Sorry about that. But, I thought I've seen her before..."
<es>

@925
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? You know her?"
<es>

@926
<en>I know nothing about Natsume yet. Including how she showed up like that, where she came from, and why she is here now...
<es>

@927
<en>And about her father...
<es>

@928
<en>I don't know anything, and nobody is telling us. Natsume is not saying anything, and she seems to avoid the topic, so I'm not asking her either.
<es>

@929
<en>But, this man might know something about Natsume?
<es>

@930
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"Oh, yeah. There was a girl who said she was looking for her father, few years ago. She looks like that girl."
<es>

@931
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Her father?"
<es>

@932
<en>It was few years ago? Natsume must have been a freshman around that time. Could it be someone looking similar to her?
<es>

@933
<en>{Grocery store worker}\n"It was few years back, so I'm not so sure. But she sure is a cutie for your girlfriend."
<es>

@934
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm telling you! It's not like that."
<es>

@935
<en>A few years ago... I'm sure it's not about her, but I couldn't forget his story.
<es>

@942
<en>{Appo-}\n"And you didn't get anything at all?"
<es>

@943
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, Miya-san was not there."
<es>

@944
<en>I called out for him few times, but he wasn't at home. He must have been out somewhere.
<es>

@945
<en>{Appo-}\n"I didn't know he closed the store. I go a lot with Kazuko, but it has never been closed."
<es>

@946
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe a summer break. Or maybe the Bon break."
<es>

@949
<en>{Appo-}\n"Well, maybe it's for the better. You can go by yourself to buy it, and give it to her as a gift. What do you think?"
<es>

@950
<en>Appo- makes a good sense once in a while.
<es>

@951
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wow, that's a great idea! Do you think Natsume would like that?"
<es>

@954
<en>{Appo-}\n"I'm sure. All the girls like surprises."
<es>

@955
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK! I'll go by myself tomorrow to get it!"
<es>

@956
<en>I imagine how Natsume will look surprised and be happy. It made me happy as well. I'm so looking forward to tomorrow.
<es>
