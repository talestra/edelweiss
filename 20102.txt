<en>{Haruka}\n"Thanks, guys. We'll be fine from here."
<es>

@14
<en>{Pierre}\n"You're welcome."
<es>

@15
<en>In the end, we all walked the girls home together.
<es>

@19
<en>{Andou}\n"Good job, guys. Now go back to your dorm."
<es>

@22
<en>{Pierre}\n"I know, I know. We're going."
<es>

@26
<en>{Sakura}\n"Thanks, guys."
<es>

@30
<en>{Rin}\n"Bye-bye, everybody."
<es>

@34
<en>{Appo}\n"Good night."
<es>

@37
<en>The girls all split off and returned to their dorm.
<es>

@40
<en>Yet Mizuki alone lingered, not heading back to the dorm. She kept glancing back at me.
<es>

@45
<en>{Pierre}\n"All right. Let's go home, guys."
<es>

@46
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah."
<es>

@47
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@48
<en>Obviously she wanted to say something, but something else was holding her back. There must be something she wants to tell me.
<es>

@49
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You guys go on ahead, I'll catch up."
<es>

@53
<en>{Appo}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@54
<en>Appo and Pierre exchanged a look and chuckled with a leer.
<es>

@59
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@60
<en>{Pierre}\n"Nothing. Take your time."
<es>

@61
<en>{Appo}\n"I'm going to sleep, so be quiet when you come home."
<es>

@62
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay."
<es>

@65
<en>{Pierre}\n"See you later. Good night, Mizuki-chan."
<es>

@70
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, okay. Good night."
<es>

@71
<en>Pierre and Appo left us alone.
<es>

@72
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@73
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You want to walk for a bit?"
<es>

@74
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes."
<es>

@79
<en>Because there aren't any tall buildings or street lights on this island, and because the sea is clear and vast, you can see innumerable stars in the sky.
<es>

@80
<en>All we could see was the vastness of the heavens above. I felt like were walking amongst the stars themselves.
<es>

@81
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's amazing. I didn't know you could see so many stars here."
<es>

@84
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah. I was blown away when I first came here and saw them."
<es>

@85
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Tell me about it."
<es>

@87
<en>We looked like a real couple as we walked along the path, looking up at the night sky together.
<es>

@90
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Th-thanks, for earlier."
<es>

@91
<en>Mizuki said in an excited voice while looking up at the sky.
<es>

@92
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No problem. It's not a big deal."
<es>

@95
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I guess you must find that rumor pretty annoying though. After all, this may ruin your relationship with someone special..."
<es>

@96
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Someone special?"
<es>

@99
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah. If there's someone special in your life right now, you wouldn't want her to get the wrong idea about you, right?"
<es>

@100
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, but only if there is one..."
<es>

@101
<en>If there's someone I liked, I might be able to use the high-class technique of making her feel jealous through this rumor.
<es>

@102
<en>But I also knew that such a trick usually turned around to bite one in the rear.
<es>

@103
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Is there a girl that you're serious about right now?"
<es>

@104
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not really. At least not at the moment."
<es>

@105
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm, I thought you were always thinking of girls."
<es>

@106
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Get out! How about you, Mizuki? What's the truth?"
<es>

@109
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm not a lesbian!"
<es>

@110
<en>She looked mad. It was clear how much she hated it when people called her a lesbian.
<es>

@111
<en>She didn't have to take it so personally, though. However, the truth is, I felt kinda relieved about that.
<es>

@112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No one really thinks you like girls more than boys, including me. What I meant, was do you have someone special in your life?"
<es>

@115
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No...\nNot really. Is that bad?"
<es>

@116
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Not at all. What it means is that whatever everyone else thinks about us, it's not going to hurt anybody else, at least for now."
<es>

@119
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You're right. And everyone'll forget all about this by the end of summer."
<es>

@120
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So just let them think whatever they want to think about us."
<es>

@121
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It won't do us any harm, so why not? And for me, it's better than being called a lesbian."
<es>

@124
<en>Mizuki started in on me anyways.
<es>

@125
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Just to make sure, this is only a pretense, okay? Just pretend."
<es>

@126
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know."
<es>

@127
<en>Even so, it sounded exciting. I could feel that something thrilling would happen this summer.
<es>

@133
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Happy birthday, Daigo!!"
<es>

@135
<en>Kampai!! With my toast, everybody shouted in unison. Today is July 29th - Daigo's birthday.
<es>

@138
<en>{Daigo}\n"Th-th-th-th-thank you!!"
<es>

@143
<en>{Ran}\n"So you've now turned 48, Kudou-kun?"
<es>

@147
<en>{Pierre}\n"Yeah, right."
<es>

@152
<en>{Haruka}\n"I didn't know that... You're still in school at that age? What a passion for learning!"
<es>

@153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Haruka, don't take her seriously."
<es>

@155
<en>However, Daigo seemed so overwhelmed that he didn't even hear our conversation.
<es>

@158
<en>{Daigo}\n"Oh... Thank you. Thank you..."
<es>

@159
<en>He was crying in joy.
<es>

@164
<en>{Pierre}\n"Come on. This is just a party. Don't cry."
<es>

@165
<en>{Kazushi}\n"He's just not used to being treated kindly."
<es>

@166
<en>{Daigo}\n"I-I've never had a birthday party for myself."
<es>

@170
<en>{Haruka}\n"Oh, poor Daigo."
<es>

@174
<en>{Rin}\n"Didn't your family ever do that for you?"
<es>

@175
<en>{Daigo}\n"My-my parents both work, so they've always been too busy..."
<es>

@179
<en>{Mei}\n"Then Meike sure you have a lot of fun with everyone today."
<es>

@182
<en>{Daigo}\n"Yeah... Yeaaah!!"
<es>

@186
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh yeah, when is your birthday, Mei-chan?"
<es>

@187
<en>Pierre made a smooth move. Good job! There's so much I should learn from him.
<es>

@190
<en>{Mei}\n"You're not supposed to ask women their age."
<es>

@191
<en>Maybe not this time... The move didn't work with Mei-sensei.
<es>

@194
<en>{Pierre}\n"I was only asking your birthday, not your age."
<es>

@199
<en>{Daigo}\n"Thank you, everybody! Thank you very much! *Snort... Snort*"
<es>

@200
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whoa! Blow your nose! Here, have a tissue!"
<es>

@203
<en>{Daigo}\n"Bbbbbfffffffffffttttttt!"
<es>

@208
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, hey! Don't blow your brains out! You'll tear the tissue!"
<es>

@211
<en>{Daigo}\n"I-I-I'm so happy to be alive!!"
<es>

@212
<en>Suddenly, Daigo got up and started chugging his beer.
<es>

@215
<en>{Daigo}\n"Phaaaahh!!"
<es>

@216
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, easy. Are you okay?"
<es>

@219
<en>{Daigo}\n"I'm okay. I'm okay."
<es>

@220
<en>Daigo thumped his chest, but he was already staggering. He didn't look fine at all.
<es>

@223
<en>{Pierre}\n"It would be perfect if he got a nice girlfriend or something."
<es>

@224
<en>{Daigo}\n"Oh, that would be asking for too much, Pierre. I'm already too happy from this - and I've used up all my luck getting this far."
<es>

@228
<en>{Rin}\n"Wow, you're so humble, Kudou-kun."
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"He's not very used to a lot of happy things happening all at once, so it's left him kinda scared."
<es>

@233
<en>{Pierre}\n"I'll have to be more proactive this summer. Especially since it seems like I've fallen behind Kazushi now."
<es>

@234
<en>Pierre gave me a suggestive smile.
<es>

@235
<en>I twitched. I thought it meant he already knew about me and Mizuki.
<es>

@236
<en>And the worst part is, he also knows that we're just pretending to see each other. He's going to enjoy watching how far we can go with this.
<es>

@241
<en>{Daigo}\n"You've found bliss now too, huh, Kazushi? So it's true that you're going out with Hinata?"
<es>

@242
<en>Since he wasn't there that time, Daigo must have heard the rumour. That or he's leaping to his own conclusions.
<es>

@247
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Come on, this isn't the time or the place. We're here to celebrate Kudou-kun's birthday."
<es>

@248
<en>To help change the subject, Mizuki poured a fresh round of beer into Daigo's glass.
<es>

@253
<en>{Haruka}\n"This is so fun! Let's have another birthday party!"
<es>

@258
<en>{Ran}\n"Whose birthday comes next?"
<es>

@262
<en>{Sakura}\n"I don't think anyone has one until a fair time from now?"
<es>

@267
<en>{Pierre}\n"So Mei-chan, please tell us when your birthday is!"
<es>

@272
<en>{Mei}\n"Umm...... mine's a ways off. Sorry."
<es>

@275
<en>It didn't look like there was anyone else. I guess there aren't that many people born in summer. Oh yeah, I wonder when Mizuki's birthday is?
<es>

@276
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, Mizuki..."
<es>

@277
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm?"
<es>

@278
<en>When did Mizuki disappear? I only took my eyes off her for a second.
<es>

@279
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Have you seen Mizuki anywhere?"
<es>

@282
<en>{Rin}\n"I just saw her leaving. Maybe she went to the bathroom."
<es>

@283
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see."
<es>

@287
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hmm? I don't see Appo either."
<es>

@288
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I haven't seen him around. Wasn't he absent from the beginning?"
<es>

@289
<en>{Pierre}\n"What a heartless guy. Where did he run off to on his best friend's birthday party?"
<es>

@294
<en>{Daigo}\n"Execution! Appo gets the death penalty!!"
<es>

@295
<en>Daigo kept at it with the beer. It's just a matter of time before he passes out, so we don't really need to worry - we all need to blow off steam every once in a while.
<es>

@300
<en>{Rin}\n"Hey, look."
<es>

@301
<en>Fujisaki-san tugged on my shirt with a grin.
<es>

@302
<en>{Rin}\n"You know, Mizuki-chan may be waiting for you outside."
<es>

@303
<en>Oh no, not again. Why does Fujisaki-san have to keep bringing that back up?
<es>

@304
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why would Mizuki be? She's probably in the bathroom."
<es>

@305
<en>{Rin}\n"Come on, maybe she snuck outside because she wants to be alone with you?"
<es>

@306
<en>I don't get it.
<es>

@307
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If that's true, then how come she didn't ask me to go with her? What's the point in stepping out by yourself?"
<es>

@310
<en>{Rin}\n"You really don't get it, do you? She's testing you to see whether you'd notice and come after her if she didn't tell you."
<es>

@311
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? Testing me?"
<es>

@312
<en>{Rin}\n"If you truly love her, you ought to be looking at her all the time. Then you'd have known that she left."
<es>

@313
<en>{Rin}\n"So I bet Mizuki's waiting outside right now for you to come after her."
<es>

@314
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm still not sure."
<es>

@315
<en>After hearing that, I started to think she might be right. Is Mizuki waiting for me outside? She's more adorable than I thought.
<es>

@318
<en>{Rin}\n"So go on. You can't make her worried."
<es>

@319
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, alright. Thanks, Fujisaki-san."
<es>

@320
<en>{Rin}\n"Good luck, guys!"
<es>

@328
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? She's not here."
<es>

@329
<en>I thought she'd be waiting just outside the cafeteria, but she wasn't there. I started wandering around looking for her.
<es>

@332
<en>{Mizuki}\n"........."
<es>

@333
<en>There you are.
<es>

@334
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki."
<es>

@337
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes?!"
<es>

@338
<en>I startled her. She jumped up in surprise.
<es>

@341
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, Kazushi. It's you."
<es>

@342
<en>She looked surprised to see me. This meant she wasn't waiting for me.\n...of course she wasn't.
<es>

@343
<en>Fujisaki-san may have said that, but we're just pretending to date. There's no way Mizuki would test me.
<es>

@344
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you doing here all by yourself?"
<es>

@347
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? Oh, I just needed to get some fresh air. To sober up, you know."
<es>

@348
<en>Made sense to me - she looked rather flushed. I sat down next to her.
<es>

@351
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How about you? What are you doing here?"
<es>

@352
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Same as you. Need to sober myself up."
<es>

@353
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm..."
<es>

@354
<en>How could I say "I was looking for you because I thought you were waiting for me"?
<es>

@355
<en>It would be so embarrassing to admit it. What the hell was I expecting, anyways?
<es>

@358
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I thought you'd come looking for me."
<es>

@359
<en>Mizuki muttered something under her breath. What did I just hear?
<es>

@360
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? What did you just say?"
<es>

@363
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahahaha, no way, right? Because there's no reason whatsoever for you to have come looking for me."
<es>

@364
<en>She glanced at me while attempting to laugh. Suddenly we lapsed into an awkward silence.
<es>

@365
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Actually..."
<es>

@366
<en>Fuck! What do I say now? Should I just tell her the truth? But we aren't really...
<es>

@367
<en>{Daigo}\n"Are you happyyyyyy?"
<es>

@368
<en>We could hear Daigo screaming from the cafeteria.
<es>

@369
<en>It seemed like the party was now in full swing. I heard people shouting with excitement.
<es>

@370
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Daigo's feeling pretty high, huh? He must be so damn happy."
<es>

@373
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I guess so."
<es>

@374
<en>Her answer's not very enthusiastic. Is it because I didn't give her the right answer earlier? Maybe... Maybe not...
<es>

@375
<en>I've been thinking about Mizuki all the time since yesterday. Maybe I'm just wasting my time and energy.\n......Hey, this sounds like I really am in love?
<es>

@376
<en>{Mizuki}\n"........."
<es>

@377
<en>The awkward silence continued oppressing us.
<es>

@378
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh yeah, when's your birthday?"
<es>

@381
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What's this all of a sudden?"
<es>

@382
<en>She sounded a bit confused.
<es>

@383
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We were all just talking about everyone's birthdays at the party. So I was wondering when yours is."
<es>

@386
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, that's okay..."
<es>

@387
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What do you mean, that's okay? Just tell me."
<es>

@390
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No..."
<es>

@391
<en>She resisted stubbornly.
<es>

@392
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why? It's just your birthday..."
<es>

@393
<en>Then, at that moment--
<es>

@394
<en>{???}\n"Hoooooooooohnn!"
<es>

@397
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@398
<en>There was a groaning, creepy voice coming from the forest. It sounded like it originated in the deepest pits of hell.
<es>

@399
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What the hell was that horrible voice?"
<es>

@402
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I-I heard it from that bush over there."
<es>

@403
<en>She pointed at a bush in the corner of the schoolyard. It's pretty dark out here when the lights aren't on...
<es>

@404
<en>{???}\n"Uhoo! Oooooooh... Mmm!"
<es>

@405
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Again...!"
<es>

@406
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Is there something in there? A wild animal?"
<es>

@407
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe. Is there anything like that on this island?"
<es>

@408
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Like what?"
<es>

@409
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Like...a wolf?"
<es>

@412
<en>{Mizuki}\n"A wolf? There aren't any wolves in Japan."
<es>

@413
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@414
<en>{???}\n"Ngh... Oooooooooooh... Mmm...!!"
<es>

@415
<en>Wait, there's something wrong with this. That groan is starting to sound more human.
<es>

@416
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What is it, then? Is there somebody out there?"
<es>

@417
<en>Mizuki pulled on my shirt, clinging to it as she looked scared. Those voices weren't ordinary for humans - they were more like the death throes of a man in agony.
<es>

@418
<en>Something is happening out there.
<es>

@419
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm going to go take a look."
<es>

@422
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No. Stop! It's too dangerous!"
<es>

@423
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm fine. I've got to help if there's been an accident."
<es>

@426
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yeah, but..."
<es>

@427
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You just stay back."
<es>

@428
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, wait...!"
<es>

@429
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll be right back."
<es>

@432
<en>Leaving Mizuki alone, I walked into the bushes.
<es>

@434
<en>Rustle, rustle, rustle...
<es>

@435
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Must be over there..."
<es>

@437
<en>Some parts of the bushes were shaking with noise and motion. There was somebody in there. I slowly trod through the bushes and tried to look into them.
<es>

@438
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi..."
<es>

@439
<en>I heard Mizuki's thin voice from behind.
<es>

@440
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What the hell are you doing here?"
<es>

@443
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Because I felt scared by myself..."
<es>

@444
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Felt scared? That's not like you."
<es>

@447
<en>{Mizuki}\n"S-sorry!"
<es>

@448
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Shh! Keep your voice down!"
<es>

@451
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm... Hmm...!!"
<es>

@453
<en>I covered her mouth with my hand as we peeped through the back of the bushes. It was dead silent.
<es>

@454
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Don't say a word.)
<es>

@455
<en>I let go of my hand.
<es>

@458
<en>{Mizuki}\n(Where? Is it close?)
<es>

@459
<en>{Kazushi}\n(There's somebody in that bush.)
<es>

@462
<en>{Mizuki}\n(Re-really?)

@464
<en>We kept quiet and held our breaths for a while. I didn't see or hear anything from there. It seemed that whoever was over there also wanted to keep quiet.
<es>

@465
<en>Does that mean they know we're here?
<es>

@466
<en>{Kazushi}\n"........."
<es>

@467
<en>Over a minute passed... Then...
<es>

@468
<en>{Appo}\n"Maybe it's just my imagination..."
<es>

@469
<en>We hear a familiar voice from the bush.
<es>

@470
<en>{Kazushi}\n(Huh? Appo?)
<es>

@472
<en>{Fuusen}\n"No one is going to come to a place like this. Now come on, keep going!"
<es>

@475
<en>{Mizuki}\n(What? Kazuko?)
<es>

@476
<en>If that's Appo and her, then that voice was...
<es>

@477
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, Kazushi."
<es>

@478
<en>{Kazushi}\n"........."
<es>

@479
<en>We walked further into the bush and peeped in there.
<es>

@484
<en>There we saw the two of them going at it doggy style beneath the stars.
<es>

@485
<en>From their silhouette they looked just like a four-legged beast about the size of two people.
<es>

@486
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Hh, hhh, yesssssssss! Thrust more! Give me more of your burly lance, Ah-chan!"
<es>

@487
<en>{Mizuki}\n(Wh-what the hell are they doing in here!?)
<es>

@488
<en>After catching a glance of those two, Mizuki turned so red I thought she'd catch on fire.
<es>

@489
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Oooh! Oooooooohhh!! Oh, yes! Oh, yessss!!"
<es>

@490
<en>That pained howling was just Fuusen moaning!
<es>

@491
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Jeez, talk about misleading."
<es>

@492
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How can you be so calm? Stop them! Go and stop them!"
<es>

@493
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why? We can't just tell them to stop. They're not doing anything wrong..."
<es>

@494
<en>Though there is a problem with where.
<es>

@495
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But they can't do that out here! I know there's some kind of law against it..."
<es>

@496
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know, but..."
<es>

@497
<en>{Fuusen}\n"AHHHHH!! You're killing me! I'm going to die of pleasure!!"
<es>

@498
<en>{Mizuki}\n"H-hey..."
<es>

@499
<en>Mizuki fell more and more silent. At first she only stole glances, but soon her eyes were glued to them.
<es>

@500
<en>In the end, we just kept our mouths shut and watched them both fuck.
<es>

@501
<en>{Mizuki}\n"H-hey..."
<es>

@502
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@503
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Um... Do men's...things...usually become that big?"
<es>

@504
<en>Mizuki stared at where the two were making contact. Appo's large, greasy cock was illuminated by the moonlight.
<es>

@505
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. They do...during sex."
<es>

@506
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I-I see. ......I can't believe such a big thing can go inside..."
<es>

@507
<en>With a surprised look, Mizuki kept looking at the point of penetration.
<es>

@508
<en>{Appo}\n"Like this? Do you like it?"
<es>

@510
<en>Appo started moving faster. He shook his hips like a beast. His pounding sounds echoed all over the campus.
<es>

@511
<en>{Fuusen}\n"AH-CHAN! YES! YES! OOOOOOHH!"
<es>

@512
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, is sex usually this intense?"
<es>

@513
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh, this is pretty intense..."
<es>

@514
<en>{Mizuki}\n"........."
<es>

@515
<en>Mizuki was struck dumb. In truth, their sex wasn't what I'd call erotically exciting.
<es>

@516
<en>I didn't know what to do in this situation with Mizuki so close to me.
<es>

@517
<en>{Mizuki}\n"........."
<es>

@518
<en>While Mizuki sat on the ground, I didn't know where to turn my eyes, since the nape of her neck and a hint of her thigh peeking out of her skirt came into my sight.
<es>

@519
<en>{Fuusen}\n"I'm coming! I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm Coming!!"
<es>

@520
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hhh?!"
<es>

@521
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki. Let's go!"
<es>

@522
<en>I took her hand.
<es>

@523
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@524
<en>I left that spot pulling Mizuki's hand behind me.
<es>

@525
<en>{Fuusen}\n"E-ec! Ecs! Ecstasyyyyyyyyyyyy!"
<es>

@533
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushiiiii!"
<es>

@535
<en>Daigo jumped up and hugged me tight as I returned to the cafeteria somewhat tired.
<es>

@536
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whoa! Hey, stop it! That's disgusting!!"
<es>

@537
<en>{Daigo}\n"Where the hell have you been? Come on! Celebrate my birthday! Entertain me more! I'm so lonely."
<es>

@538
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay. Okay. Let go!"
<es>

@542
<en>{Haruka}\n"Ahahahaha! Kiss him! Kiss!"
<es>

@543
<en>The party had become rather chaotic.
<es>

@547
<en>{Mizuki}\n"........."
<es>

@548
<en>Slightly flushed, Mizuki was still looking down behind my back.
<es>

@553
<en>{Rin}\n"Mizuki, are you okay? Feeling sick?"
<es>

@554
<en>Fujisaki-san asked her in a concerned voice.
<es>

@557
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, I'm fine... I'm just a little tipsy."
<es>

@558
<en>{Rin}\n"Would you like me to bring you some water?"
<es>

@559
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes, please."
<es>

@561
<en>Fujisaki-san left us to get the water and Sakura came over.
<es>

@564
<en>{Sakura}\n"Where have you guys been?"
<es>

@565
<en>She knew we'd left the party. She was asking us in a teasing tone.
<es>

@568
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Where?"
<es>

@569
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Just outside. We needed some fresh air."
<es>

@572
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hmm..."
<es>

@573
<en>Sakura sensed something from our awkward behavior.
<es>

@577
<en>{Rin}\n"Here's your water."
<es>

@579
<en>Fujisaki-san passed Mizuki a glass of water. She picked it up and started to take a drink when...
<es>

@583
<en>{Sakura}\n"You two just had sex, didn't you?"
<es>

@587
<en>{Mizuki}\n *PFFFTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT*
<es>

@588
<en>Mizuki did a spit-take with her water, drenching Sakura.
<es>

@591
<en>{Sakura}\n"... ... ...It's cold... I'm soaking wet!"
<es>

@594
<en>{Mizuki}\n"B-but you're the one who just said such nonsense!"
<es>

@597
<en>{Sakura}\n"Because Rin told me she heard voices."
<es>

@598
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Voices? Fujisaki-san?"
<es>

@603
<en>{Rin}\n"I-I'm sorry! I was worried about you two, so I went outside. That's when I heard moaning from the bushes..."
<es>

@608
<en>{Mizuki}\n"H-hey, wait!"
<es>

@609
<en>That's Fuusen. I guess Rin chased after me, heard Fuusen's voice, panicked, and ran back into the cafeteria.
<es>

@610
<en>Thinking that voice was ours.
<es>

@614
<en>{Sakura}\n"She said you guys were wild. Honestly, I didn't know you two had gone that far. I'm sorry for calling you a lesbian, Mizuki."
<es>

@617
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? That's okay, but..."
<es>

@618
<en>Mizuki must be really confused. She's cleared of being a lesbian, but now they think she's having wild sex with me.
<es>

@622
<en>{Mizuki}\n(Hey, what should we do? Things are getting really out of hand...)
<es>

@623
<en>{Kazushi}\n(I don't know...)
<es>

@629
<en>{Sakura}\n"But you guys just started going out recently, right? That's amazing."
<es>

@630
<en>{Rin}\n"I guess one's voice comes out that much during it? Does it happen on its own?"
<es>

@634
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh... That's..."
<es>

@635
<en>Mizuki was absolutely in trouble. She wasn't good with this topic to begin with, and they were asking her things she didn't even know.
<es>

@639
<en>{Sakura}\n"How many times do you guys have sex in a week?"
<es>

@642
<en>Thump!
<es>

@647
<en>{Sakura}\n"Ouch!!"
<es>

@648
<en>She crossed the line, so I tapped Sakura on the head with my fist.
<es>

@649
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, stop it. You're bothering Mizuki."
<es>

@650
<en>I glared at Sakura, but she jokingly chuckled.
<es>

@653
<en>{Sakura}\n"That's remarkably manly for you, Harucchi. Trying to protect your girl?"
<es>

@654
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...sort of.\nLook, I'll be keeping my eye on her, so don't bother Mizuki."
<es>

@658
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh? Hey, Kazushi?"
<es>

@663
<en>{Rin}\n"Wow! Like a knight in shining armor! Boyfriends are so nice."
<es>

@664
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm sure you will get yourself a cool guy soon. So excuse us."
<es>

@665
<en>{Rin}\n"Okay. Sorry for disturbing you two. Enjoy yourselves."
<es>

@669
<en>{Sakura}\n"Sorry to pester you, Mizuki. See you later."
<es>

@674
<en>Sakura and Fujisaki-san left us alone without any further trouble.
<es>

@675
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm? They just left like that?"
<es>

@676
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Maybe I should act like your boyfriend more often. Then they won't bother us."
<es>

@679
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I-is that how it works?"
<es>

@680
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Anything you try to keep a secret can be used to tease you, I guess. I don't really know since I'm not experienced either."
<es>

@683
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You may be right. If we're open about this, there won't be any reason for them to try and make jokes about it."
<es>

@684
<en>{Kazushi}\n"See?"
<es>

@685
<en>So if you don't want them to make a fuss over this, just act natural.
<es>

@689
<en>{Pierre}\n"Hey, you two. Are you drinking?"
<es>

@690
<en>A drunken Pierre came up to us. He was pretty far gone already, and going around the room with a bottle of liquor in his hand.
<es>

@691
<en>{Pierre}\n"Mizuki-chan! You're not drinking! Have a round on me!"
<es>

@696
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh, no, I've had enough already."
<es>

@699
<en>{Pierre}\n"Come on. Just a little more..."
<es>

@702
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I mean it. I'm fine. ...ah."
<es>

@703
<en>Pierre insisted she keep drinking. Typical for a drunk.
<es>

@704
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Pierre."
<es>

@705
<en>Suddenly Pierre stopped and laughed with a quizzical look on his face.
<es>

@709
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh, sorry. I forgot that Mizuki-chan's your girl. I don't wanna cause any problems."
<es>

@710
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You better not or I'll get really pissed off! I'll beat the crap outta you!"
<es>

@713
<en>{Pierre}\n"Ahaha, just kidding, buddy. Sorry, Mizuki-chan."
<es>

@717
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh...okay..."
<es>

@718
<en>Pierred laughed it off as he went off and headed over to some other girl. Mizuki looked surprised again.
<es>

@721
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So I don't have to do anything, huh?"
<es>

@722
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Guys always back off when a girl says she has a boyfriend."
<es>

@723
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hmm... it sounds like a boyfriend is rather convenient."
<es>

@724
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not sure how I feel about being called convenient..."
<es>

@727
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You're so convenient, Kazushi."
<es>

@728
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You're saying that on purpose, aren't you?"
<es>

@729
<en>Mizuki and I chuckled together.
<es>

@730
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, Kazushi. I want to drink some juice."
<es>

@731
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't tell me that."
<es>

@734
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Come on, aren't you a convenient man? You can go and get it for me, can't you?"
<es>

@735
<en>{Kazushi}\n"And you can go and get it yourself, can't you?"
<es>

@738
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Come on, don't be so stingy. If you're a boyfriend, then quit complaining and get it."
<es>

@739
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think you're misunderstanding something. When it comes to this, a girlfriend should..."
<es>

@745
<en>{Haruka}\n"Hee-hee..."
<es>

@746
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah..."
<es>

@747
<en>Haruka and Ran were watching us.
<es>

@748
<en>{Haruka}\n"You two are getting along well."
<es>

@752
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No... this is only..."
<es>

@756
<en>{Ran}\n"You're making me jealous. But oh well."
<es>

@757
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh well, what?"
<es>

@758
<en>{Haruka}\n"I'm jealous too, so I'm gonna grab some more food. Later!"
<es>

@759
<en>{Ran}\n"Oh yeah. I brought a tub to take some home."
<es>

@762
<en>They left us alone again. They didn't want to bother us, huh?
<es>

@765
<en>{Mizuki}\n"......pff."
<es>

@766
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...haha."
<es>

@767
<en>We looked at each other and both laughed bashfully. It felt kind of odd, kind of embarrassing, and yet kind of nice.
<es>

@770
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What do they mean that we're "getting along well"?"
<es>

@771
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No idea."
<es>

@772
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Me neither."
<es>

@773
<en>Small talk prevailed, but that was enough for us.
<es>

@774
<en>Is this really just a pretense?\nNo... I think I really like Mizuki.
<es>

@777
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahahaha."
<es>

@778
<en>But what about her? Playing make-believe is fun and all, but it could be a lot more so if we really started going out together.
<es>

@779
<en>I'm beginning to think about stuff like that.
<es>

@785
<en>The next morning I saw Sakura and Fujisaki-san in the laundry room.
<es>

@786
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Morning!"
<es>

@791
<en>My greeting seemed to be a bit too loud. Sakura squatted down with her hands over her ears.
<es>

@792
<en>{Sakura}\n"Harucchi, please don't shout."
<es>

@793
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Are you OK? Got a headache?"
<es>

@794
<en>{Sakura}\n"Yes. Major headache."
<es>

@795
<en>{Rin}\n"Sakura had too much to drink last night."
<es>

@796
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, I see. Sakura's got a hangover, huh?"
<es>

@799
<en>{Sakura}\n"I'll never drink again!"
<es>

@800
<en>{Kazushi}\n"People with hangovers always say that. I don't think we're going to have another party like that soon, anyways."
<es>

@801
<en>We only got permission because it was a birthday party. Otherwise, we're usually not allowed to drink.
<es>

@804
<en>{Rin}\n"Oh, now I remember."
<es>

@805
<en>Fujisaki-san spurt that out all of a sudden.
<es>

@806
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Remember what?"
<es>

@809
<en>{Rin}\n"Someone else has a birthday coming up pretty soon. It's on August 1st."
<es>

@810
<en>{Kazushi}\n"August 1st? That's the day after tomorrow!"
<es>

@811
<en>A birthday in two days! But I can't recall anyone at the party who said their birthday was coming up that soon.
<es>

@812
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whose birthday could it be?"
<es>

@815
<en>{Sakura}\n"Oh, I remember, too. That's Mizuki's isn't it?"
<es>

@816
<en>Sakura chimed in while kneading her temples with her hands.
<es>

@817
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Mizuki? Her birthday is the day after tomorrow? Are you sure?"
<es>

@818
<en>{Sakura}\n"Yeah, I'm positive, because she said to knock it off when I tried to remember it as Yaoi Day."
<es>

@819
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'd say the same thing."
<es>

@820
<en>{Rin}\n"I wonder why she didn't say anything about it last night?"
<es>

@823
<en>{Sakura}\n"It must have been difficult for her to bring that up. She is kind of shy, you know."
<es>

@824
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, she really is."
<es>

@825
<en>I think she wants us to celebrate her birthday, but doesn't know how to ask...
<es>

@826
<en>{Kazushi}\n"She really is such a pain like that."
<es>

@829
<en>{Rin}\n"A pain?"
<es>

@830
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, nothing. I was talking to myself. Should we throw a party for her?"
<es>

@837
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So there you have it."
<es>

@838
<en>I grabbed a few key people and told them about organizing a surprise party for Mizuki.
<es>

@843
<en>{Haruka}\n"I didn't know her birthday was coming so soon."
<es>

@844
<en>{Ran}\n"Neither did I. We didn't do anything for her last year."
<es>

@848
<en>{Fuusen}\n"She's not the kind of girl who'd request something like that herself, now is she?"
<es>

@853
<en>{Pierre}\n"Another party! Great!! I wish we could have a party every day!"
<es>

@858
<en>{Daigo}\n"I thought I was the one who deserved to celebrate their birthday. I feel jealous!"
<es>

@859
<en>Daigo squeezed a dishrag with a chagrined look.
<es>

@863
<en>{Appo}\n"You really had a good time, huh? Don't worry, we'll do it again for you next year."
<es>

@864
<en>{Pierre}\n"Of course."
<es>

@865
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know you wanted to have a happy occasion all to yourself, but sharing the pleasure with others could be even more joyful, don't you think?"
<es>

@869
<en>{Daigo}\n"Yeah. You may be right. I will celebrate her birthday at the cost of my life!"
<es>

@873
<en>{Rin}\n"We can make another birthday cake and some food today!"
<es>

@877
<en>{Sakura}\n"What about a present? If we all chip in, we can get her something nice."
<es>

@880
<en>{Daigo}\n"Present? I didn't get a present..."
<es>

@881
<en>He's right. There was a lot of food at the party last night, but no presents for Daigo...
<es>

@886
<en>{Ran}\n"We haven't known you long enough to get you anything, Daigo. Anyways, let's chip in 1000 yen each for Mizuki's present. I'll collect it from everybody."
<es>

@891
<en>{Fuusen}\n"No way! Don't let Ran handle this or it'll all end up in her purse. Also, 500 yen each should be plenty."
<es>

@894
<en>{Ran}\n"No way... I won't be able to pocket anything at that rate..."
<es>

@895
<en>{Fuusen}\n"See? 500 yen each."
<es>

@896
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Right. Girls, you do the cooking and buy the present. Guys, we'll set up the venue. That good for everybody?"
<es>

@900
<en>{Pierre}\n"We've got the hang of it after yesterday. Let's make the day after tomorrow even more wild!"
<es>

@904
<en>{Daigo}\n"Sounds like this is going to be more fun and exciting than for me..."
<es>

@908
<en>{Appo}\n"That's because it's no fun getting worked up over celebrating a guy's birthday."
<es>

@912
<en>{Sakura}\n"Ahaha, that was blunt."
<es>

@916
<en>{Haruka}\n"By the way, we've gotta make sure Mizuki doesn't find out before the party."
<es>

@920
<en>{Rin}\n"This is going to be a surprise party!"

<en>{Pierre}\n"Kazushi, you've got take Mizuki out on a date that day. In the meantime, we'll get everything prepped."
<es>

@925
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I bet Mizuki's going to be really surprised when she comes back to a birthday party!"
<es>

@926
<en>After imagining Mizuki's surprise, I couldn't wait. I was really looking forward to the day after tomorrow.
<es>

@931
<en>Then, on August 1st...
<es>

@932
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This way. This way."
<es>

@935
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Where are we going?"
<es>

@936
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry about it."
<es>

@937
<en>The mission assigned to me was to keep Mizuki away from the cafeteria all day while the party prep was under way.
<es>

@938
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey, what about lunch?"
<es>

@946
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That was delicious! Are you sure you don't want to split the bill?"
<es>

@947
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, yeah. I'm fine."
<es>

@948
<en>I bought her lunch in the village and we had a picnic.
<es>

@949
<en>Since it was so sudden, it's going to take until nightfall. I need to keep her as far away as possible until things are done, so this constitutes a necessary investment.
<es>

@950
<en>I put in for her present too, so I'm getting sort on cash.
<es>

@953
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What are we going to do now? Heading back?"
<es>

@954
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No!! That's not a good idea."
<es>

@957
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Not a good idea?"
<es>

@958
<en>Shit. If she catches on I'll be in big trouble.
<es>

@959
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, would you want to walk around here for a bit? We don't come down to the village very often together, right?"
<es>

@960
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sure, that works..."
<es>

@961
<en>Then she stared at me. Shit! Has she noted something suspicious?
<es>

@962
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ummm... Do you want dessert or something? What should I get you?"
<es>

@965
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Dessert?! I want some shaved ice!!"
<es>

@966
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do they sell shaved ice here?"
<es>

@969
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I hear they've started selling them at the fish shop. They use a lot of ice, you know."
<es>

@970
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Alright, let's get shaved ice!"
<es>

@973
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I always wanted to try the Tuna Frappe flavor! I'll get the strawberry flavor, so Kazushi, you get the tuna one."
<es>

@974
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Me? Get a tuna flavored shaved ice? That sounds nasty."
<es>

@977
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But let me taste a bit of it. Okay?"
<es>

@978
<en>No pain, no gain. I have to keep her attention at all costs...
<es>

@979
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh... Okay. Let's go!"
<es>

@983
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Blecch... Ptt."
<es>

@986
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ugh... Tuna Frappe, what a strong flavor."
<es>

@987
<en>It was nauseating. It was like they used the liquid that comes out of rotten fish and put on top of the shaved ice.
<es>

@990
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Are you okay, Kazushi? I told you not to eat it all."
<es>

@991
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't want to waste it... Blech."
<es>

@992
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I feel bad, Kazushi. I'm sorry I got you to order that."
<es>

@993
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You ate a lot of it too. You pushed yourself, didn't you?"
<es>

@996
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I felt like I had to take responsibility... but I guess I couldn't match up. You wound up eating most of it."
<es>

@997
<en>Obviously we were both trying to let the other person eat less of it, but in the end, we both ate our fair share.
<es>

@1000
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You're looking kinda pale, Kazushi. We'd better get back."
<es>

@1001
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wha..."
<es>

@1002
<en>No way! We still have about three more hours to kill.
<es>

@1003
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm fine! I'll pop into the general store and get a drink. That should help."
<es>

@1006
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wait. I'm coming too."
<es>

@1010
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hello."
<es>

@1013
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Miya-san, can we get something to drink? Something to clear the head and an upset stomach."
<es>

@1018
<en>{Miya}\n"Welco...... What's wrong? You two don't look good."
<es>

@1019
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Miya-san, could you please tell the guy at the fish shop to stop selling Tuna Frappe snowballs for us?"
<es>

@1020
<en>{Miya}\n"Y... you two actually ate that? Hold on, I've got some good herbal tea that I can bring for you."
<es>

@1021
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thank you, Miya-san."
<es>

@1025
<en>Miya-san went back inside the back room. Mizuki was feeling slightly better, so she looked around the store.
<es>

@1028
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ooh!"
<es>

@1029
<en>And something on the shelf caught her eyes.
<es>

@1032
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So cute..."
<es>

@1033
<en>It looks like a pendant with a small stone dangling on it. The pendant looks like a dewdrop.
<es>

@1034
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do you like cute stuff?"
<es>

@1037
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Of course I do. I am a girl, you know."
<es>

@1038
<en>She was a little upset at my statement, but her attention was fixed on the pendant.
<es>

@1041
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How nice. I want to buy it."
<es>

@1042
<en>I looked at the price tag. It was quite expensive.
<es>

@1045
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Urk... Quite pricey. It's over my budget."
<es>

@1046
<en>{Miya}\n"Do you like that?"
<es>

@1051
<en>Miya-san returns with two cups of tea in his hands.
<es>

@1052
<en>{Miya}\n"Drink this. You'll feel better."
<es>

@1053
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Whoa! This has got to be working!"
<es>

@1054
<en>This surely looks and smells like herbal tea. We began to sip on it with gratitude.
<es>

@1057
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's so bitter! ...It'd better be working."
<es>

@1058
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hmm. I'm kinda getting used to this tea's bitterness."
<es>

@1059
<en>We both sipped on the bitter tea. Our stomachs started to feel warm, and we both felt a lot better.
<es>

@1062
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I feel better now."
<es>

@1065
<en>{Miya}\n"That's good."
<es>

@1066
<en>Miya-san picked up the pendant Mizuki was looking at.
<es>

@1069
<en>{Miya}\n"This pendant is made from a stone found exclusively on this island. It's a natural stone we don't gather very often, which is why it's a bit expensive."
<es>

@1070
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I see. I guess this may be too much of luxury for me now."
<es>

@1071
<en>{Kazushi}\n"So you're not buying it?"
<es>

@1074
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I want to, but I can't. It's a bit too much for me."
<es>

@1075
<en>Mizuki looks a bit sad but seems to give up for now. She continues to sip on the tea. She's quite a sport.
<es>

@1076
<en>{Miya}\n"So, are you two on a date?"
<es>

@1079
<en>{Mizuki}\n *PTTTTTBBBBBTTTTTT*
<es>

@1082
<en>She did it again. This time she did it on Miya-san.
<es>

@1083
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Ahh! Miya-san. I'm terribly sorry."
<es>

@1084
<en>{Miya}\n"That's okay. Did I say something wrong?"
<es>

@1085
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do we look like we're on a date?"
<es>

@1088
<en>{Miya}\n"Yes. You two look good together."
<es>

@1089
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Really?"
<es>

@1092
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Don't take that so seriously. Miya-san's a merchant so he has to be a good talker. This is how he sells things."
<es>

@1093
<en>{Miya}\n"Oh, no. I really think you two look like a nice couple."
<es>

@1096
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Some nice shop talk, Miya-san."
<es>

@1099
<en>{Miya}\n"Oh, Mizuki-chan. You are a shy girl, huh?"
<es>

@1102
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wha?! ...Argh! Let's go, Kazushi!"
<es>

@1106
<en>Flushed with embarrassment, Mizuki dashed out of the store.
<es>

@1110
<en>{Miya}\n"Did I say something wrong?"
<es>

@1111
<en>For my sake, it's a good thing that Mizuki left the store first.
<es>

@1112
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya-san, I have a favor to ask you..."
<es>

@1115
<en>{Miya}\n"Hmm? What?"
<es>

@1121
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Kazushi, you kept me waiting! What on Earth were you doing in there?"
<es>

@1122
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I was just talking with Miya-san. That's all."
<es>

@1125
<en>{Mizuki}\n"So, what are we going to do now?"
<es>

@1126
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well..."
<es>

@1127
<en>We still have some time...
<es>

@1128
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's go to the inlet!"
<es>

@1136
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I should have brought my swimsuit if we were heading to the beach."
<es>

@1137
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You were swimming naked before."
<es>

@1140
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You promised not to bring that up!"
<es>

@1141
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Okay, okay..."
<es>

@1143
<en>Mizuki walked barefoot on the beach toward the water. While running on tiptoe, she played with the waves lapping on the beach.
<es>

@1144
<en>She looked a little sad, but not too bothered that she couldn't go swimming now.
<es>

@1145
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You really like the water, don't you?"
<es>

@1148
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I wouldn't even mind if I had to live in the sea."
<es>

@1149
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You used to be on the swim team, right? I heard you placed in nationals during junior high."
<es>

@1150
<en>I heard she was even in a magazine and drew a lot of attention.
<es>

@1153
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I didn't want to do it, but they forced me to."
<es>

@1154
<en>Mizuki replies with no interest in that particular subject.
<es>

@1155
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's kind of wasting your talents like this, don't you think? You could have gone to the Olympics."
<es>

@1158
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Give me a break. I don't want to swim for competitions any more. That was hard - incredibly hard for me."
<es>

@1159
<en>Mizuki looks sad and upset.
<es>

@1160
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hard training? How long did they make you swim for you to hate it?"
<es>

@1161
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It's not that training was so hard. It's just..."
<es>

@1162
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What was hard then?"
<es>

@1165
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It was..."
<es>

@1166
<en>Flushing slightly, Mizuki hesitated to continue talking.
<es>

@1167
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it? Don't leave me hanging. Did you get physically abused?"
<es>

@1170
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? Abused?"
<es>

@1171
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh!! Was it sexual harassment?! Did your horny coach touch you?"
<es>

@1172
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Sexual harassment? No! Nothing like that!"
<es>

@1173
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No? Are you sure? What is it then?"
<es>

@1176
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No, nothing like that happened. It was..."
<es>

@1177
<en>Mizuki looks down, sticking her index fingers up together.
<es>

@1178
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I just couldn't deal with the boys' competition speedos."
<es>

@1179
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1180
<en>Boys' swimsuits? I have no clue what Mizuki is talking about.
<es>

@1183
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'm talking about men's competition swimsuits! Swimsuits! Don't you think those are horrible?!"
<es>

@1184
<en>Mizuki leaned towards me, demanding my agreement.
<es>

@1185
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Well, I don't know. What do you think?"
<es>

@1188
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Don't you think those things are way too small? They're so tight, and..."
<es>

@1189
<en>Mizuki, again, looks flushed. She may be picturing that thing packed in tight trunks.
<es>

@1192
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Being in the pool with those things - it was torture for me. I put up with it for three years!"
<es>

@1193
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is that the reason why you gave up on swimming?"
<es>

@1196
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You bet!"
<es>

@1197
<en>I guess it's true. She's not kidding, is she? This is way out of my league.
<es>

@1200
<en>{Mizuki}\n"It doesn't matter now, though, because I just want to swim for me. That's why I came to this island."
<es>

@1201
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If that's okay with you, that's okay with me."
<es>

@1202
<en>But I still kind of feel like she's wasting her talent.
<es>

@1203
<en>{Mizuki}\n"This island suits me perfectly. I can swim all year and I never have to see a man's improper speedo."
<es>

@1204
<en>{Kazushi}\n"This school used to only be for girls, huh?"
<es>

@1205
<en>So this is why Mizuki chose this school. She didn't want to see men in speedos.
<es>

@1206
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why did you join the swimming club in the first place?"
<es>

@1209
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I was asked to join rather forcefully, and that was the quickest, easiest way to swim every day. There wasn't an ocean or river near us."
<es>

@1212
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The best we had nearby was a pool, so I joined a team in elementary school, but I never realized that the boy's swimwear in junior high would look that different."
<es>

@1213
<en>Mizuki shuddered as she visualized it in her mind. It seemed to be a big deal for her.
<es>

@1216
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Signing up for a gym or a private pool would have been too expensive, so I had no choice but to put up with going to my school's club."
<es>

@1217
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I guess I get the picture now."
<es>

@1218
<en>But one question.
<es>

@1219
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But that means you hadn't learned to swim since you were born or anything right? So what made you like swimming so much?"
<es>

@1220
<en>I know you don't need a reason to like something, but there's usually some kind of motivation at the front. I wonder what it was for Mizuki.
<es>

@1221
<en>{Mizuki}\n"My motivator was dolphins."
<es>

@1222
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Dolphins?"
<es>

@1223
<en>{Mizuki}\n"When I was in the third grade, my family took me to see a dolphin show."
<es>

@1226
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The dolphins were all adorable. I liked them instantly. Then, later on, I found out that you could swim with them in the sea too."
<es>

@1227
<en>{Mizuki}\n"On TV, I saw foreigners swimming with a dolphin. They looked like they were having so much fun that I got jealous."
<es>

@1228
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Then I said, "I want to do that too!"."
<es>

@1229
<en>Mizuki looks out at the horizon with her sparkling eyes.
<es>

@1232
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I also saw a movie based on the story of this guy. He could dive 100 meters deep without scuba gear on. I was stunned, thinking 'Wow, how could people do that?'"
<es>

@1233
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Then I wondered if you had to swim that well to swim with dolphins. So I thought I needed to become a good swimmer to swim with them... That's what got me started."
<es>

@1234
<en>Mizuki said that she started showing her natural talent for swimming immediately. But in fact, that wasn't what she really wanted to do.
<es>

@1237
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But the boys, showing everything in their trunks! What the hell's up with that? I didn't want to swim together with those things!"
<es>

@1238
<en>She looks pretty upset. It must have been a majorly traumatic experience for her.
<es>

@1241
<en>{Mizuki}\n"All I want is to swim with the dolphins in the sea. The emerald green sea, the deep blue ocean, any of the world's beautiful waters!"
<es>

@1244
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's my dream."
<es>

@1245
<en>Mizuki was full of life when she talked about her dream. She looked more beautiful than usual, which made me hooked on her.
<es>

@1248
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Uh... You don't really care about this, do you?"
<es>

@1249
<en>Suddenly Mizuki became quiet. Maybe she mistook my silence for indifference.
<es>

@1250
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You kidding? I'm impressed. That's a wonderful dream."
<es>

@1253
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You really think so?"
<es>

@1254
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah. I do."
<es>

@1255
<en>Swimming with the dolphins. It was a perfect picture for Mizuki. She fits right in there.
<es>

@1256
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Any dolphins in this sea around here?"
<es>

@1259
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The fishermen have seen some dolphins stuck in the bay before, but I've never seen them for myself."
<es>

@1260
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It would be great if you could swim with them."
<es>

@1263
<en>{Mizuki}\n"When I do, you have to swim with me, Kazushi!"
<es>

@1264
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Me? No... not me."
<es>

@1267
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You'll be fine, you'll be fine. I'll make sure you can swim better. And I'll hold your hand too."
<es>

@1268
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm not a kid, you know."
<es>

@1269
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes, you are... as far as I'm concerned."
<es>

@1270
<en>Swimming with the dolphins. That would be fun - I'd love to do it then, sharing in Mizuki's dream.
<es>

@1271
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Then I have to practice swimming more first."
<es>

@1272
<en>{Mizuki}\n"That's right. I have to train you."
<es>

@1273
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugh... Sob... Oh, right."
<es>

@1274
<en>I recalled it as I was about to cry and took it out of my pocket.
<es>

@1277
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Here you go..."
<es>

@1278
<en>It is a little paper bag - something I got from Miya-san's store.
<es>

@1281
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What's this?"
<es>

@1282
<en>Given the size of the bag, Mizuki could already guess what was in it.
<es>

@1285
<en>{Mizuki}\n"For me? Can I open it?"
<es>

@1286
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Go ahead."
<es>

@1288
<en>She opens the bag and as expected, finds the pendant inside.
<es>

@1289
<en>{Mizuki}\n"How did you get this?"
<es>

@1290
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I didn't steal it. I bought it."
<es>

@1293
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You bought it? But it was expensive."
<es>

@1294
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I talked the price down with Miya-san."
<es>

@1295
<en>And yet it was still pricy for me. In fact, I couldn't pay for it all at once, so now I've got to pay it off in installments.
<es>

@1296
<en>I owe Miya-san a massive favor.
<es>

@1297
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Miya-san said that little stone hanging there is a charm called a 'Mermaid's Tear'."
<es>

@1300
<en>{Mizuki}\n"A mermaid's tear?"
<es>

@1301
<en>The truth is, it was the name that pushed me to actually buy the pendant for Mizuki - because a mermaid was my first impression of her.
<es>

@1302
<en>So I begged him to let me have it.
<es>

@1303
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I thought this pendant is a perfect fit for you."
<es>

@1306
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But I can't take something so expensive."

<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please take it. It's not like I can wear it, you know?"
<es>

@1310
<en>{Mizuki}\n"But..."
<es>

@1311
<en>Mizuki looked stunned and a few tears welled up in her eyes. The pendant worked brilliantly as a surprise gift.
<es>

@1312
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'll feel bad if you don't take it - it wouldn't look right on a guy anyways. Here, let me do it."
<es>

@1313
<en>I took the necklace form her hand and fastened it around her neck.
<es>

@1314
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Good!! I told you! It looks perfect on you!"
<es>

@1317
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You think so?"
<es>

@1318
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, So take it. Please?"
<es>

@1319
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Okay... In that case, thank you."
<es>

@1320
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My pleasure."
<es>

@1321
<en>Mizuki carefully wrapped the pendant with her hands and glanced at me.
<es>

@1324
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Why are you so nice to me today? Buying me lunch and the present..."
<es>

@1325
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why?..."
<es>

@1326
<en>I have to keep Mizuki away from school until things are ready for the party. That's why...
<es>

@1327
<en>The present wasn't part of the plan, though. Present?
<es>

@1328
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Do you know about today, by any chance?"
<es>

@1329
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What?"
<es>

@1330
<en>Today... The reason I'd been keeping her away.
<es>

@1331
<en>Today is Mizuki's birthday. Everyone is now preparing to throw a surprise birthday party for her.
<es>

@1332
<en>By now, everything must be ready with food and presents.
<es>

@1335
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Is this my birthday present?"
<es>

@1336
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@1337
<en>No...it's not your birthday present.\nI just saw how you longingly gazed at it.
<es>

@1338
<en>Your real present should be sorted and ready at the party.
<es>

@1339
<en>{Mizuki}\n"You knew it, huh? That's why you asked me out on a date?"
<es>

@1340
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A date...?"
<es>

@1341
<en>What have I done? I asked her out rather forcibly. We ate and strolled around together. Then I gave her a present.
<es>

@1342
<en>Good Lord! I'm already covering all the birthday events!
<es>

@1343
<en>And I did all this alone!
<es>

@1344
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh..."
<es>

@1345
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Happy birthday!!"
<es>

@1346
<en>Sorry, everyone. I got there first.
<es>

@1349
<en>{Mizuki}\n"No wonder. I found the whole thing very strange."
<es>

@1350
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I just wanted to surprise you."
<es>

@1353
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I was. Thank you. I feel so happy."
<es>

@1356
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I feel touched."
<es>

@1357
<en>I saw a wet drop glitter in the corner of her eye. I was astonished by her tear. I never expected her to cry.
<es>

@1360
<en>{Mizuki}\n"I'll treasure this."
<es>

@1361
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah."
<es>

@1362
<en>I felt so embarrassed. Everything I did today would make me look extremely snobby.
<es>

@1365
<en>{Mizuki}\n"........."
<es>

@1366
<en>Nonetheless, we ended up with a nice situation. The two of us alone on her birthday and she's happy with my present.
<es>

@1367
<en>What would a real couple do next?
<es>

@1370
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@1372
<en>Our arms accidentally brushed each other, and Mizuki jerked back away. I guess she was acting more conscious of me.
<es>

@1373
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Uh... Mizuki."
<es>

@1376
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Y-yes!? What can I do for you!?"
<es>

@1377
<en>Politeness? She was extremely stiff.
<es>

@1378
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We are just, uh, pretending to be a couple, right?"
<es>

@1381
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Y-Yes... D-Do you not want to do it anymore?"
<es>

@1382
<en>Mizuki looks puzzled. I shake my head.
<es>

@1383
<en>{Kazushi}\n"N-no, no! The other way around!"
<es>

@1386
<en>{Mizuki}\n"The other way around?"
<es>

@1387
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I mean. You and I..."
<es>

@1388
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Me and you...?"
<es>

@1389
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I mean. Can you..."
<es>

@1391
<en>*BANG!*
<es>

@1394
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Wah! W-what's that?"
<es>

@1395
<en>A huge firework sparkled in the sky above the school.
<es>

@1396
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh..."
<es>

@1397
<en>It was the signal that preparations were done. We'd decided to signal it by fireworks since no one knew where we'd be at the time.
<es>

@1398
<en>And...
<es>

@1399
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What's that? Has a war broken out?"
<es>

@1400
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, it's just... oh, look."
<es>

@1401
<en>*SCREEEEEEEEE*
<es>

@1402
<en>Another firework goes up in the sky.
<es>

@1404
<en>*BANG*
<es>

@1405
<en>This time, the firework didn't make a flower shape.
<es>

@1406
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Huh?"
<es>

@1407
<en>Instead, this made a message saying...
<es>

@1408
<en>Happy Birthday!!
<es>

@1409
<en>It was a message-firework, created with alchemy.
<es>

@1410
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Did you make that too?"
<es>

@1411
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No, that's from everybody else. They've been preparing a surprise party for you since this morning."
<es>

@1412
<en>{Mizuki}\n"What? A party? For me?"
<es>

@1413
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Everything's set up now, so let's go back. Tonight, everyone's going to be celebrating your birthday."
<es>

@1416
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Everyone...for me..."
<es>

@1417
<en>It seems the whole thing left Mizuki speechless with emotion and surprise. I took hold of her hand.
<es>

@1418
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Let's go home. All our friends are waiting."
<es>

@1421
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Yes!"
<es>

@1423
<en>Holding hands together, we set out to walk back to school. Tonight was going to be a lot of fun.
<es>

@1424
<en>And a memorable night for Mizuki...
<es>

@1425
<en>.........
<es>

@1426
<en>By the way, talk about timing for an interruption.
