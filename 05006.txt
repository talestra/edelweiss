<es>

@450
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......what's the problem?"
<es>

@455
<en>{Hu-sen}\n"Being a virgin is not the problem. Your true peoblem is your small heart starts screaming right away."
<es>

@456
<en>{Rei}\n"And that's probably why you are still a virgin."
<es>

@463
<en>{Appo-}\n"And being a virgin makes your heart smaller."

@478
<en>{Rin}\n"I don't care whether the person is virgin or not......but I definitely wanna be someone who is more confident."
<es>

@479
<en>How can I be more confident after all this.
<es>

@483
<en>{Pierre}\n"How about we make a project on Kazushi?\nWhy don't we figure out what he needs to chage so he can get a girl!!"
<es>

@488
<en>{Appo-}\n"Each one of us pick one weak aspect he needs to change. Why don't we start from over there."
<es>

@489
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait......"
<es>

@494
<en>{Sakura}\n"Well, I think his face is boring."

<es>

@506

<es>

@531

<es>

@532
<en>A unique voice froze everyone.\nA tall man was standing there.
<es>

@535
<en>{Panchu-}\n"I can't stand hearing to you guys anymore.\nWhat do you know so much about Kazushi?"
<es>

<es>

@542
<en>I wonder how much of his words reached everybody's heart.\nEverybody who enjoyed picking on me until just a few seconds ago can't say a single word now.
<es>

@544
<en>Panchu- sits down quietly as he still keeps everyone's attention. His every move is so cool like a movie star.
<es>

<es>

@557

<es>

@558
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Why are you screaming?\nI can't understand what you are saying. Stop screaming."
<es>

@559
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? You're coming to see me?\nWhat for?\nYou need to calm down."

@561
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. I know.\nWhat? You want me to sit up straight? Now?\nwhy......?"
<es>

@562
<en>I was told to sit up straight and lectured for an hour.
<es>

@567
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My feet hurts."
<es>

@568
<en>Why did I deserve a lecture?\nMaybe she's in her rebellious stage.\nIt's tough to handle girls in their puberty.
<es>

@569
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No more girls for me.\nI will look for boys from now on."
<es>

@572
<en>Oh, that's Panchu-.\nHe seemed just finished taking a bath.\nHe looks cool just coming out from a shower.

<es>

@582
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I think we can understand each other more by having a bare relationship."
<es>

@583
<en>But I respect him so much and it's hard for me to get close to him. It's hard to catch up to him. I need to upgrade myself as a man.
<es>

@584
<en>Fortunately, I can find so many naked boys in here.
<es>

@585

<es>

@684
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I realized I've been very narrow minded! I want to have my eyes open to various areas.\nI thought it's worth trying to become a gay."

@688

<es>

@689

<es>

@757
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"You......"
<es>

@758
<en>After I explained my situation, he lost his words.
<es>

@759
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"How can you be so silly?\nI am so ashamed of you."
<es>

@760
<en>{Kazushi}\n"To me, being a virgin at this age is more ashamed."
<es>

@761
<en>I responded being in the sulks.
<es>

@762
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You don't understand my feeelings.\nYou probably had any girl you wanted."
<es>

@763
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"(Mr.Yagami sighing)"
<es>

@764
<en>Mr.Yagami shook his head as if he can't be any more disappointed.
<es>

@767
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"I understand it's important for guys around your age.\nBut, being a virgin is not so bad at all, you know?"
<es>

@768
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why? It is shameful.\nYou are a drop-off as a man."
<es>

@769
<en>Or it may even mean you're a drop-off as a creature. In a survival world, inferior males don't get to mate with females. That's me right now.
<es>

@772
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"What's the problem of being a virgin?"
<es>

@773
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's like you're not growing up at all.\nI wanna be an adult."
<es>

@774
<en>Mr.Yagami and Panchu- ofcourse, even Appo- lately seems a grown up.\nIt's all because of the power of sex.
<es>

@775
<en>Sex turns a boy to a man.
<es>

@778
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"That doesn't give you a reason to become gay."
<es>

@779
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I just thought......\nif I could somehow get rid of my virginity, I would be more confident about myself."
<es>

@780
<en>It's the first step to become a man.\nUntil you take that first step, you stay as a boy.
<es>

@783
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"You wanna be more confident......"
<es>

@784
<en>But he seems having trouble hiding a smile.
<es>

@785
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's so funny?"
<es>

@788
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"What makes you think you can be a grown up by getting rid of your virginity? Girls's body might change after sex but our body doesn't change with or without virginity."
<es>

@789
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That may be true, but......"
<es>

@790
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"It's your heart what changes.\nIt's the feeling of achievement from getting connected with the one you love......"
<es>

@793
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"The achieving feeling eventually turnss into confidence. Remember that. It's not the act of losing your virginity you will be getting confidence from."
<es>

@794
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Your heart and your action to make your love one happy is the only reason to make you become a grown up. And it will happen without you noticing it."
<es>

@798
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"When you become serious about one girl, you don't even have a extra space in you mind whether to think how you can become a man or not. You will become desperate to love that girl."
<es>

@800
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Losing your virginity will happen as a process of loving that girl. You won't just become a man just because you put your dick in a hole."
<es>

@801
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@802
<en>His words reached the bottom of my heart.\nI don't know what to say.
<es>

@803
<en>His words were supported by his own experience and there was nothing I could do but drooping my head and listen.
<es>

@804
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"First you find a girl of your dream.\nA girl you won't regret to bet your whole life on."
<es>

<es>

@806
<en>I already have hard time finding any girls.\nI'm sure the girl like that won't even care about me......
<es>

@809
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"If she's better than you.\nBe a better man so you can match her.\nFind somebody who makes you wanna improve yourself."
<es>

@810

<es>

@813
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"Not while you're thinking about just getting rid of your virginity......"
<es>

@816
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"It doesn't matter even if there are 100 girls who want you. You need to be wanted by the one girl you love. You bet your whole life on that girl."
<es>

@817
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"You need to be prepared for the day you meet that person. You need to start accumulating all the things you can dedicate for that person."
<es>

@820
<en>{Teacher Yagami}\n"When you finally accumulated everything to match up with the person, the destiny will help you two meet."
<es>

@821
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Destiny......"
<es>

@822
<en>I felt bright light right in front of my eyes.\nDestiny......\nI am not matured yet to meet the love of my life.
<es>

@823
<en>As I start accumulating all the experiences as a man, the destiny will guide me to that person.\nI am still only at the start line.
<es>

@829
<en>I am awake now.\nI feel like I was given a new life.\nI realized how stupid I was.
<es>

@830
<en>I am all right now.\nI won't go for guys anymore.
<es>

@831
<en>I don't care if people laugh at me for being a virgin.\nUntill I find the love of my life, I will live with pride as a virgin.
