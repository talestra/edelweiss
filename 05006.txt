@7
<en>Summer break, a golden time. We played. Day in and day out...
<es>

@8
<en>Time flies when you're having fun.\nOur summer was passing us by.
<es>

@9
<en>And here sat men agonizing over that.
<es>

@16
<en>{Pierre}\n"Summer break is almost over.\nWe did a lot this summer."
<es>

@21
<en>{Daigo}\n"Yeah, we did.\nIt was awesome."
<es>

@22
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It sure was.\nBut for some reason, I'm not satisfied."
<es>

@23
<en>Something was missing. We made lots of memories. We played from dawn to dusk and wore ourselves out.
<es>

@24
<en>But we were missing something important.
<es>

@29
<en>{Appo}\n"You think so? I'm pretty satisfied. I conquered each of the 48 tantric positions with Fuu-chan."
<es>

@37
<en>{Boys}\n"That's what we're missing!"
<es>

@38
<en>Daigo, Pierre, and I said it in harmony. We made for a sad ensemble.
<es>

@43
<en>{Appo}\n"What was that?\nA sad chorus from the virgin boys?"
<es>

@49
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's the problem! We're still virgins!"
<es>

@52
<en>{Pierre}\n"Actually, I'm not technically a virgin. But we desperately need sex!!"
<es>

@55
<en>{Daigo}\n"What's sex?"
<es>

@58
<en>{Pierre}\n"Oh no! Daigo is already trying to protect his mind!"
<es>

@63
<en>{Appo}\n"There're plenty of girls around us. How come you're still virgins? You shame me as your friend."
<es>

@64
<en>Appos words wounded our pride.
<es>

@66
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...Appo's right. We have no right to argue this with him. We should be ashamed of ourselves!!"
<es>

@67
<en>We came to an academy full of women, and look at this predicament! We had loads of chances, and yet just what have we accomplished?!
<es>

@68
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My grandfather was a zero fighter pilot! I can't face him now! My brave grandpa must be laughing up in heaven, saying\n'look at how pathetic of a man my grandson is!'"
<es>

@69
<en>At the rate I'm going, I'll stay a virgin all my life. I can't let it stay this way! What should I do?!
<es>

@70
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I won't deserve my state pension in the future. I won't be able to have children. I won't be a useful asset to society."
<es>

@75
<en>{Pierre}\n"Don't blame yourself so much. Our summer is not over yet."
<es>

@76
<en>{Daigo}\n"I'm not giving up now. Neither should you."
<es>

@77
<en>Pierre and Daigo helped me get up.\nTheir eyes hadn't lost their dignity.
<es>

@78
<en>Appo was picking his nose by our side.
<es>

@79
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......you guys are real men! You guys never give up. I respect your guts."
<es>

@82
<en>{Daigo}\n"Kazushi, you can do it if you try. You have turned many impossibilities into realities."
<es>

@85
<en>{Pierre}\n"He's right. We need you to be strong, Kazushi!"
<es>

@92
<en>{Appo}\n"Well, good for you. But it's shameful having virgin friends at this age, so hurry up and do something about it."
<es>

@93
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......you're right.\nThanks guys......"
<es>

@94
<en>I'm blessed to have friends such as these. Even a little guy like me could make it this far because of these guys.
<es>

@95
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thanks, guys! I promise I won't give up! There's gotta be a way to turn around this situation!"
<es>

@101
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's more like you, Kazushi!"
<es>

@104
<en>{Daigo}\n"You can do it, Kazushi!\nI'll do my best, too!"
<es>

@105
<en>{Pierre}\n"Let's have a race to see who can lose their virginity first."
<es>

@106
<en>That's right! We need to do our best! There's only a few days of summer left, but we'll find ourselves wonderful girlfriends and kiss our virginity goodbye!
<es>

@111
<en>{Appo}\n"You guys are shining.\nBeing a virgin......\nIt was a long time ago."
<es>

@112
<en>Appo was still picking his nose.
<es>

@119
<en>{Sakura}\n"Yawwwwn, I'm tired. Rin, let me rub your boobs."
<es>

@124
<en>{Rin}\n"Why? Those aren't related."
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@128
<en>Sakura and Fujisaki-san. Sakura's like a close friend. What would happen if I asked her out?
<es>

@134
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sakura! I'm falling in love with you!"
<es>

@137
<en>{Sakura}\n"Ahahahahaha! You? Falling in love with me?"
<es>

@138
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You heard me. Go out with me!"
<es>

@141
<en>{Sakura}\n"Hmm, well, okay - if you'll take Rin with me as a set."
<es>

@146
<en>{Rin}\n"What? Me?"
<es>

@147
<en>{Kazushi}\n"OK then. I'm falling in love with you too, Fujisaki-san!"
<es>

@148
<en>{Rin}\n"I can't handle someone that loose..."
<es>

@149
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? No?"
<es>

@152
<en>{Sakura}\n"If Rin says no then I'm saying no, too."
<es>

@153
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No......"
<es>

@158
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Those two always stick together. I should've guessed that's how it would be."
<es>

@159
<en>Who else is there?\nI'm desperate.\nIs there anyone who would never reject me?
<es>

@164
<en>Fuusen and Andou showed up.
<es>

@165
<en>Fuusen is Appo's girl, and Andou's out. ......but as I watched them, Andou and I made eye contact.
<es>

@166
<en>{Andou}\n"Oh, Haruma-kun, good morning."
<es>

@167
<en>{Kazushi}\n"G-g-good morning."
<es>

@168
<en>Why am I stammering?\nShe caught me off guard.
<es>

@169
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Hey, Haruma-kun, why are you turning red?"
<es>

@170
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? I am?"
<es>

@171
<en>My cheeks were warm. Did I get bashful from Andou's greeting? No way......
<es>

@174
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Haruma-kun, do you perhaps like Rei?"
<es>

@177
<en>{Andou}\n"Huh? Me?"
<es>

@178
<en>Now Andou was starting to blush. She was unexpectedly cute......No! No way in hell!
<es>

@179
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm......"
<es>

@182
<en>{Andou}\n"Stop it, Kazuko-chan. Don't play with me like that! See? Haruma-kun's suffering, too."
<es>

@183
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm......"
<es>

@184
<en>Oh no. My face is getting hot. Maybe I do have special feelings for Andou?
<es>

@187
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Every time I see flowers in bloom, I can't help but urge them along."
<es>

@188
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Do what?"
<es>

@191
<en>{Andou}\n"I don't get it either.\nUmm......see you later, Haruma-kun."
<es>

@192
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right."
<es>

@195
<en>Andou and Fuusen found a pair of empty seats and sat down.\nAndou... She might be cuter than I thought.
<es>

@196
<en>She's got big muscles...\nShe'd be helpful for when I need to carry heavy stuff around...
<es>

@197
<en>...am I thinking about this the wrong way? But the dating manuals say that it's better to focus on a person's good aspects than their flaws if you want to get along...
<es>

@198
<en>I'm not in a position to be picky right now.
<es>

@203
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Oh, Rei, where's your drink?"
<es>

@204
<en>{Andou}\n"I'm thinking about making some juice today."
<es>

@205
<en>Some juice? All she's got on her tray is a couple of unpeeled apples...
<es>

@206
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Ah, I get it. You're having apple juice today."
<es>

@207
<en>{Andou}\n"Yes, I am.\nHa!!"
<es>

@211
<en>*SQUASH*
<es>

@212
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......EH!?"
<es>

@213
<en>Andou squeezed an apple in her giant hand, crushing it into juice.
<es>

@214
<en>{Andou}\n"Ha!"
<es>

@216
<en>*SQUASH*
<es>

@217
<en>Andou squashed the apples one after another. By the time she was done, she had a mug full of apple juice.
<es>

@220
<en>{Andou}\n"*Gulp gulp gulp* Phaah! I love fresh apple juice first thing in the morning."
<es>

@221
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah, ah, ah, ah..."
<es>

@224
<en>N-no way. If I was hugged by that, I'd be crushed between those lumberjack arms.
<es>

@225
<en>Died during sex on top of Andou...
<es>

@226
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah, ah, ah, ah..."
<es>

@227
<en>Think reasonably, man. Andou may be a nice girl, but she's a completely different species.
<es>

@228
<en>{Kazushi}\n"How can such a tough, manly girl even exist?"
<es>

@229
<en>{Kazushi}\n"..................hmm?"
<es>

@230
<en>Wait a second? A manly girl? A girl who's like a man...
<es>

@232
<en>Ahhhhhhhhh! That's it! A bolt of truth just struck my head!
<es>

@233
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course! If I can go for a manly girl, then maybe I'll be happy with a man!!"
<es>

@234
<en>They say everybody's created equally...if I can love a guy like how I love girls, then everyone else in the world is a possible love interest. Wow, what a harem.
<es>

@235
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Am I a genius or what?"
<es>

@236
<en>What a fiendish idea. If the girls won't give me the time of day, then I can try with guys.
<es>

@237
<en>{Kazushi}\n"There's still hope for me yet!"
<es>

@242
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Boys have holes too, you know?"
<es>

@249
<en>I shared my revolutionary discovery with the guys. They were as still as a photograph from a while, rocked by my inspiration.
<es>

@250
<en>{Kazushi}\n"If you put it in the ass, it still counts as losing your virginity, right?"
<es>

@253
<en>{Pierre}\n"Wait a minute, Kazushi. Let's just calm down here."
<es>

@254
<en>{Daigo}\n"Th-think straight. Think straight."
<es>

@255
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I am thinking straight. You guys like me a lot, right?"
<es>

@258
<en>{Appo}\n".................."
<es>

@261
<en>{Pierre}\n"This is so not good. Kazushi's in serious condition."
<es>

@262
<en>{Appo}\n"Those eyes!! Those eyes are seeing me as nothing more than a hole!!"
<es>

@263
<en>{Daigo}\n"If Kazushi seriously asks me for my arse, I'm not sure if I'll be able to reject him..."
<es>

@264
<en>{Pierre}\n"Are you nuts!? Reject him flat out! I don't want you guys losing your virginity to each other!"
<es>

@265
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, guys, what are you whispering about with each other over there?"
<es>

@272
<en>{Appo}\n"It's nothing. You stay there and calm down, all right?"
<es>

@273
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What is it?\nWhatever..."
<es>

@280
<en>{Daigo}\n"Wh-what should we do?"
<es>

@281
<en>{Pierre}\n"It's obvious that he still prefers girls. We'll find a few chicks to catch his eye again and he'll wake up from this."
<es>

@282
<en>{Appo}\n"Then we should have a party with a bunch of girls. I'll ask Fuu-chan to gather her friends around."
<es>

@285
<en>{Daigo}\n"That'll kill two birds with one stone. I can use it to look for a girlfriend myself, right?"
<es>

@288
<en>{Pierre}\n"You do that. I'll find one for me as well. We'll take this as our last chance for the summer!!"
<es>

@291
<en>{Appo}\n"I wanna make a good memory, too."
<es>

@294
<en>{Daigo}\n"You already have one.\nDon't make me tell Fuusen."
<es>

@297
<en>{Appo}\n"Come on!! Let me have some fun, too!!"
<es>

@300
<en>{Pierre}\n"Calm down, you guys. Remember that Kazushi's our top priority. If we don't do something about him, he'll be in you guys!"
<es>

@305
<en>{Boys}\n"...................................."
<es>

@309
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you guys getting excited about? Let me in."
<es>

@310
<en>Am I unpopular with guys too? No, I should be popular with guys!
<es>

@311
<en>Oh! I get it!\n......Hahaha, they're just acting shy.
<es>

@312
<en>I don't blame them. We were friends till yesterday. From today on, we are lovers.
<es>

@319
<en>{Appo}\n"K-Kazushi's eyes... are his pupils getting dilated?"
<es>

@320
<en>{Daigo}\n"Why's he giving us that lecherous smile?\n...it's so gross."
<es>

@323
<en>{Pierre}\n"W-we have to do something about him..."
<es>

@334
<en>{Pierre}\n"There you are."
<es>

@335
<en>It's them. They seem to be happy for some reason.
<es>

@338
<en>{Daigo}\n"Yo, Kazushi, check this out! We're having a party with the girls!"
<es>

@339
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A party?"
<es>

@342
<en>{Appo}\n"You can thank me later. I asked Fuu-chan to gather up some girls for us."
<es>

@343
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Girls?\nA party with girls?\n......are you serious?"
<es>

@346
<en>{Pierre}\n"That's right! Girls, man, girls! There will be tons of girls!"
<es>

@347
<en>{Daigo}\n"You'd rather have a girl over a guy, right Kazushi?"
<es>

@348
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course I do! Who the hell would choose boys when where's girls around? It's a party!!"
<es>

@349
<en>This may really be my last chance for the summer.
<es>

@350
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Pierre! You got any Dep on you?"
<es>

@353
<en>{Pierre}\n"You need it now!?"
<es>

@354
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That's right! I need to try hard tonight!"
<es>

@357
<en>{Pierre}\n"All right! Kazushi is ready for this!"
<es>

@360
<en>{Daigo}\n"Aw, I wish I had bangs..."
<es>

@361
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm gonna risk everything I've got on today's party. I'm prepared to spend the rest of my days a virgin if I fail tonight."
<es>

@364
<en>{Appo}\n"Sounds like he's serious."
<es>

@365
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yeah, I'm real serious. Let's do it, boys!! WOOHOO!"
<es>

@368
<en>..................\n............
<es>

@373
<en>{Mizuki}\n"A pompadour?"
<es>

@374
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Not good?"
<es>

@379
<en>{Ran}\n"So not cool."
<es>

@381
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No!!"
<es>

@385
<en>{Sakura}\n"Harucchi, I think that's the part of you that's no good."
<es>

@386
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I-I'm no good?"
<es>

@390
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Well, Haruma-kun, I don't think you're bad. You just aren't quite there."
<es>

@394
<en>{Andou}\n"Haruma-kun, you're a nice person. But when it comes to love and boyfriends, your name just doesn't come up."
<es>

@395
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I-it doesn't?"
<es>

@396
<en>Even Andou was telling me that. I don't have any right to chose someone, do I?
<es>

@400
<en>{Ran}\n"I almost fell for you a while ago, but, to be honest, you don't have what it takes to seal the deal."
<es>

@401
<en>{Kazushi}\n"To seal the deal?"
<es>

@405
<en>{Mizuki}\n"To start with, you're an idiot. Girls don't like stupid boys."
<es>

@409
<en>{Haruka}\n"Maybe it's broadmindedness? Or that he doesn't seem resourceful?"
<es>

@410
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I see......"
<es>

@413
<en>I don't know where things went wrong for everything to end up like this. I was all ready to seduce girl after girl...
<es>

@416
<en>{Appo}\n"I don't think it's any use trying to figure out why he can't pull a girl. He'll never be popular until he loses his virginity."
<es>

@417
<en>{Kazushi}\n"But I'm a virgin because I'm not popular!!"
<es>

@419
<en>I didn't mean to raise my voice like that. When I realised what I'd done, I could hear the girls whispering.
<es>

@422
<en>{Rin}\n"Like a Virgin? Haruma-kun's into Madonna?"
<es>

@427
<en>{Sakura}\n"Stupid, that's not the virgin he's talking about."
<es>

@434
<en>{Haruka}\n"Then which virgin? Oh, is it..."
<es>

@438
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Hey! I told you I don't like to talk about that stuff!!"
<es>

@442
<en>{Mei}\n"Hey, girls, I think it's kinda rude to talk about it when he's standing right there."
<es>

@446
<en>*psstwhsppsst*
<es>

@447
<en>Their cold glares and whispers started choking me. A greasy sweat began to condense out of every pore in my body.
<es>

@448
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you guys saying?\nWhat's wrong with being a virgin!?\nEveryone's born a virgin!!"
<es>

@449
<en>And when I realized what I was doing, I was shouting at them. Now everybody was greeting me with an icy stare.
<es>

@450
<en>{Kazushi}\n"......what?"
<es>

@455
<en>{Fuusen}\n"There's nothing wrong with being a virgin, but being so narrow-minded that you blow your top and shout like that is a problem."
<es>

@456
<en>{Andou}\n"And that's probably why you're still a virgin."
<es>

@463
<en>{Appo}\n"And being a virgin makes your temper even shorter."
<es>

@464
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ggh...sorry I'm a virgin with a short temper. But I'm not the only virgin here."
<es>

@465
<en>He's acting like it's none of his concern, but Daigo...
<es>

@471
<en>{Daigo}\n"What are you talking about? You're the only virgin here."
<es>

@472
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What!?\nWait a minute!\nDaigo......!!"
<es>

@473
<en>{Daigo}\n"You are one rare virgin."
<es>

@475
<en>Ngh... Traitor! What happened to friendship among men... Our friendship?!
<es>

@478
<en>{Rin}\n"That doesn't make much of a difference to me, but... It would be more reassuring to be with someone who was self-confident."
<es>

@479
<en>How could I be self-confident after all this?
<es>

@483
<en>{Pierre}\n"How about we make a project of Kazushi? We'll analyze why he's not popular and remodel him!"
<es>

@488
<en>{Appo}\n"Each of us will pick one weakness that he needs to change. Why don't we start over there?"
<es>

@489
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait......"
<es>

@494
<en>{Sakura}\n"Well, I think his face is boring."
<es>

@498
<en>{Mizuki}\n"Get rid of that regent's hairstyle."
<es>

@502
<en>{Andou}\n"I don't like his normal hairstyle either. It's creepy because I can't see his eyes."
<es>

@506
<en>{Haruka}\n"You never get a sense of purity from guys with long bangs, do you? ...Oh, I'm not talking about you, Kazushi-kun."
<es>

@510
<en>{Fuusen}\n"Your low grades."
<es>

@514
<en>{Mei}\n"You really need to get a leg up on that for next semester."
<es>

@518
<en>{Ran}\n"You're the sort of guy who, despite being told you have the potential, never actually gets the job done."
<es>

@520
<en>Will there be an end to this? They just keep going...
<es>

@523
<en>{Pierre}\n"How should we fix him?"
<es>

@524
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can stop now...\nI don't want to be even more miserable..."
<es>

@525
<en>This is bullying! It's definitely not a party!
<es>

@531
<en>{Panchu}\n"Hey, hey, you all."
<es>

@532
<en>A unique voice froze everyone.\nA tall man was standing there.
<es>

@535

@542
<en>I wondered how much they understood sempai. None of the people who were talking about me before spoke, and the cafeteria was silent.
<es>

@544
<en>Panchu-sempai sat down quietly as he held everybody's attention. Every move he made was so impressive, like a movie star. He's manly, so manly...
<es>

@545

<es>

@546
<en>I'm in love! I've always admired him before, but now I'm honestly in love!
<es>

@547
<en>I'll follow him the rest of my life! Who cares about girls! Guys are so much better!
<es>

@552
<en>I called my home that night.
<es>

@556
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, it's me, your brother. Are you the only one there? Well, maybe I should ask you too."
<es>

@557
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm, would you hate me if I fell in love with a guy?"
<es>

@558
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What? Why are you screaming? I can't understand what you're saying."
<es>

@559
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Huh? You're coming here? What good would you coming here do? Calm down."
<es>

@560
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I won't do anything stupid...\nWait, what exactly do you mean "do anything stupid"?"
<es>

@561
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I know. Huh? Sit up straight? Here? Okay......"
<es>

@562
<en>I was told to sit up straight, and my little sister lectured me for an hour.
<es>

@567
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ah, my legs hurt."
<es>

@568
<en>Why did I deserve a lecture? Maybe she's just in her rebellious phase. It's tough to handle girls during puberty...
<es>

@569
<en>{Kazushi}\n"No more girls for me. Guys are the way to go."
<es>

@572
<en>Oh, it's Panchu-sempai. He looks like he's just gotten out of the bath. He looks so fresh and manly straight out of the bath.
<es>

@573
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Panchu-sempai! Are you done taking your bath?"
<es>

@574
<en>{Panchu}\n"Oh, hey 'azushi. You ''ould 'ake one 'oo."

@576

<es>

@580
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ahh, his back's so manly."
<es>

@581
<en>He keeps snatching my heart. I really want to wash his back for him.
<es>

@582
<en>{Kazushi}\n"The basic foundation of male relationships is skinship."
<es>

@583
<en>But sempai is like a flower on a high cliff; I can never get close to him. I need to become more of a man. I have to become a man quickly.
<es>

@584
<en>And most fortuitously, this is a watering hole for gentlemen.
<es>

@585
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I need to become a man first."
<es>

@586
<en>I wonder who'll come.
<es>

@597
<en>{Appo}\n"...shit, it's Kazushi!"
<es>

@598
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, guys! Are you going to take a bath now? Let's go together!"
<es>

@603

@606

@607
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, wait! Where are you guys going? I thought you were here to take a bath."
<es>

@610
<en>{Pierre}\n"Well, we were, but it can wait."
<es>

@611
<en>Why's he saying that after coming all the way here? I feel like they've been avoiding me lately.
<es>

@612
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You guys came all the way here.\nLet's take bath together.\nYou guys used to like me a lot!"
<es>

@616

@630

<es>

@638
<en>{Pierre}\n"Sensei! Save us!"
<es>

@647
<en>They quickly hid themselves behind Yagami-sensei.
<es>

@648
<en>{Yagami}\n"What's wrong, guys?"
<es>

@649
<en>{Appo}\n"Kazushi is going to rape us!"
<es>

@652
<en>{Yagami}\n"What? He's going to rape you guys......"
<es>

@658
<en>Yagami-sensei, huh? He's handsome too. What's wrong with him?
<es>

@661
<en>{Yagami}\n"Urk......?! I just felt a chill...?"
<es>

@662
<en>But he's married. I don't wanna have an affair.
<es>

@663
<en>Oh no, my mind was all filled with sempai before. I'm so unfaithful.
<es>

@664
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I don't want my family to cry later on. I think I should aim for singles."
<es>

@667
<en>{Yagami}\n"What are you muttering?"
<es>

@668
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sensei, how do you feel about gays?"
<es>

@671
<en>{Yagami}\n"Huh? Gays?"
<es>

@672
<en>{Kazushi}\n"They say that gays will save a man in need, right? They're words a virgin couldn't be more thankful for!"
<es>

@675
<en>{Yagami}\n"What are you saying, Kazushi?! What happened to him?"
<es>

@680
<en>{Daigo}\n"He's been single for so long, he's turned to men..."
<es>

@683
<en>{Yagami}\n"Wh-what?! Hey, hold on a minute, Kazushi!"
<es>

@684
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I realized I need to broaden my view and be more flexible about things! That's why I thought it might be nice to be gay!"
<es>

@688
<en>{Yagami}\n"You're joking, right?"
<es>

@689
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm dead serious! I'm globalizing! I've gone borderless!"
<es>

@692
<en>{Yagami}\n"Hey, Kazushi! Have you lost your mind?"
<es>

@693
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Please take my virginity away!"
<es>

@702
<en>{Pierre}\n"Ahhhhh! Save us, sensei!"
<es>

@703
<en>My buddies were still hiding behind Yagami-sensei and cowering in fear. It was turning me on.
<es>

@709
<en>{Yagami}\n"Y-you dumbass! Open your eyes, Kazushi!"
<es>

@710
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I just want to become a man! That's why a man is fine too!!"
<es>

@713

@723

@727

@733
<en>{Yagami}\n"All right. If you really insist, I will do it with you."
<es>

@734
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, really? May I!?"
<es>

@737
<en>{Yagami}\n"You seriously wanted to!!!?"
<es>

@738
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Of course I did!\nThank you, sensei!!"
<es>

@741
<en>{Yagami}\n"Look, you. It's time to open your eyes!!"
<es>

@748
<en>Thock!
<es>

@750
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Ugggahh!!"
<es>

@754
<en>I was called into the teachers' lounge.
<es>

@757
<en>{Yagami}\n"You......"
<es>

@758
<en>By the time I finished explaining my situation, Yagami-sensei was lost for words.
<es>

@759
<en>{Yagami}\n"How can you be so silly? I'm past being ashamed of you."
<es>

@760
<en>{Kazushi}\n"To me, it's more shameful to still be a virgin at my age."
<es>

@761
<en>I responded by sulking.
<es>

@762
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You've got it nice. You're popular. You'll never understand my feelings."
<es>

@763
<en>{Yagami}\n *sigh*
<es>

@764
<en>Yagami-sensei shook his head as if he couldn't be any more disappointed.
<es>

@767
<en>{Yagami}\n"I understand that boys your age get hung up about that, but there's nothing to be ashamed of in being a virgin."
<es>

@768
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Why? It's shameful.\nYou're a failure as a man."
<es>

@769
<en>No, you're a failure as an animal too. They teach us that inferior males fail to mate in the wild. That's my position right now.
<es>

@772
<en>{Yagami}\n"What's your problem with being a virgin?"
<es>

@773
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's like you're still a child. I want to be an adult."
<es>

@774
<en>Yagami-sensei and Panchu-senpai of course, and even Appo seemed like grown-ups lately.\nIt's all due to the magic of sex.
<es>

@775
<en>Sex turns a boy into a man.
<es>

@778
<en>{Yagami}\n"Then isn't turning to men putting the cart before the horse?"
<es>

@779
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I just thought......\nIf I could somehow get rid of my virginity, I would be more confident about myself."
<es>

@780
<en>It's the first bright step towards becoming a man. You remain a boy until you take that first step.
<es>

@783
<en>{Yagami}\n"You want to be more confident..."
<es>

@784
<en>But he seemed to have trouble hiding a massive smile.
<es>

@785
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's so funny?"
<es>

@788
<en>{Yagami}\n"What makes you think that losing your virginity makes you a grownup? Girls' bodies might change after sex, but for a man, his body is the same either way."
<es>

@789
<en>{Kazushi}\n"That may be true, but......"
<es>

@790
<en>{Yagami}\n"It's a man's heart that changes. It's the feeling of achievement from connecting with someone you cherish, and making the one you love feel happy."
<es>

@793
<en>{Yagami}\n"This feeling of achievement is what matures into confidence. Remember that. Throwing away your virginity won't make you into a man."
<es>

@794
<en>{Yagami}\n"Your desire to make the woman you love happy, and the days you spend struggling to make it happen are what makes you a man. And it will happen without you realizing it."
<es>

@798
<en>{Yagami}\n"When you become serious about a girl, you won't have any extra space in your mind to think about whether or not you can become a man. You will become desperate to share your love with that girl."
<es>

@800
<en>{Yagami}\n"Losing your virginity will happen over the course of that, and that life will make you a man. Sticking it in some hole doesn't make you a man."
<es>

@801
<en>{Kazushi}\n".................."
<es>

@802
<en>His words reached the bottom of my heart. I didn't know what to say.
<es>

@803
<en>His words were supported by his own experience, and there was nothing I could do but lower my head and listen.
<es>

@804
<en>{Yagami}\n"First, you need to find the girl of your dreams. A great girl you won't regret betting your whole life on."
<es>

@805
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Is it really possible to find a girl like that? Even if I did, such a girl wouldn't even look at me..."
<es>

@806
<en>Look at how unpopular I am. Even when I wasn't picky, none of them cared about me. Such a dream girl...
<es>

@809
<en>{Yagami}\n"If you're no match for her, then become a man who is. Struggle your hardest. Suffer. Find someone who's that important to you."
<es>

@810
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You think I can find someone like that?"
<es>

@813
<en>{Yagami}\n"Not while your only concern is losing your virginity. If you don't care who, then that person isn't important to you."
<es>

@816
<en>{Yagami}\n"Even if you're popular with 100 girls who are fine too, there's no point. You need to be wanted by the one girl you cherish. And you give her everything you have."
<es>

@817
<en>{Yagami}\n"Don't turn into some empty shell of a man who has nothing to offer her when you do find her. Start accumulating what you can now."
<es>

@820
<en>{Yagami}\n"When you've finally reached a point where you can match up with that girl, destiny will bring you two together."
<es>

@821
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Destiny......"
<es>

@822
<en>I felt a bright light shining in front of my eyes. An encounter brought by destiny...\nI'm not mature enough yet to meet the love of my life.
<es>

@823
<en>As I start accumulating the experience needed to be a proper man, destiny will guide me to my one true love. I'm still waiting at the starting line.
<es>

@826
<en>{Yagami}\n"How you live today will make you who you are tomorrow. You live right at this moment with pride. Don't live a life you would be ashamed of."
<es>

@827
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Yes, sir!"
<es>

@829
<en>I finally opened my eyes. I felt like I had been reborn. I finally realized how stupid I had been.
<es>

@830
<en>I'm all better now. I won't chase after guys anymore.
<es>

@831
<en>I don't care if people laugh at me for being a virgin.\nUntil I find the love of my life, I will live with pride as a virgin.
<es>

@832
<en>Because that's who I am.
<es>

@835
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I'm a virgin!!!\nDoes anybody have a problem with that!!?"
<es>

@836
