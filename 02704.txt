<en>{Kazushi}\n"I forgot to ask what her room number was..."
<es>

@8
<en>It would be too risky to sneak in and search around until I found her room.
<es>

@11
<en>{Miya}\n"Haruma-kun?"
<es>

@12
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...huh?"
<es>

@13
<en>I heard a familiar voice and was surprised to find someone standing next to me.
<es>

@14
<en>{Kazushi}\n"G-good evening, Miya-san!"
<es>

@15
<en>What's he doing here?\nMaybe he's here to peep at the girls?
<es>

@18
<en>{Miya}\n"I hope you're not coming to some misunderstanding."
<es>

@19
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Umm...so why are you here tonight?"
<es>

@20
<en>He's very suspicious. I thought he was a good guy, but maybe he's a pervert.
<es>

@23
<en>{Miya}\n"Now your face is clearly telling me that there's been a misunderstanding. I'm just here to deliver daily supplies to the new student."
<es>

@24
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh, that's what I thought."
<es>

@27
<en>{Miya}\n"Did you really?"
<es>

@28
<en>Oh yeah. His store carries all sorts of general goods. He must be here to get Natsume-chan set up.
<es>

@29
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Where's your delivery?"
<es>

@30
<en>His hands were empty.
<es>

@33
<en>{Miya}\n"I turned it over to Mei-sensei. Now I'm heading home."
<es>

@34
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I thought so too. Honestly."
<es>

@35
<en>{Miya}\n"Oh, brother. Ahaha... I guess I should get going before I'm suspected any further."
<es>

@39
<en>He left, scratching his head.
<es>

@40
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Thank you and good bye."
<es>

@41
<en>He looked tired. I felt bad for suspecting him.
<es>

@42
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Wait a minute......"
<es>

@43
<en>He must have been standing there for a while, as I didn't seem him at the entrance.
<es>

@44
<en>He came here, delivered the goods, and instead of heading straight home, he stood here watching the girls' dorm.
<es>

@45
<en>{Kazushi}\n"I wonder what he was doing here."
<es>

@46
<en>Oh well, maybe he was just having a quick smoke.
<es>

@47
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh shit! I should've asked him where Natsume-chan's room is."
<es>

@48
<en>Where could it be?\n...Ah!
<es>

@49
<en>One of the windows popped open. Natsume-chan's face hung out from over the sill.
<es>

@50
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Hey, I wanted to pay you a visit, but I don't know what room you're in."
<es>

@51
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma! Hurry and get up here!"
<es>

@52
<en>She seemed to be having an emergency.
<es>

@53
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What's wrong?"
<es>

@54
<en>{Natsume}\n"Just hurry! There's a demon in my room!"
<es>

@55
<en>{Kazushi}\n"A demon?"
<es>

@60
<en>It was just a cockroach.
<es>

@61
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You can come in now."
<es>

@65
<en>{Natsume}\n"Did you get it?"
<es>

@66
<en>She opened the door and cautiously peered inside.
<es>

@67
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Don't worry, see?"
<es>

@70
<en>{Natsume}\n"You don't need to show it to me!"
<es>

@71
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oops. Sorry."
<es>

@72
<en>I wrapped it up in a tissue and was about to throw it into the bin...
<es>

@73
<en>{Natsume}\n"Not in the room! Throw it away outside!"
<es>

@74
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's already dead."
<es>

@77
<en>{Natsume}\n"So what!?"
<es>

@78
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Never mind."
<es>

@79
<en>Fine. I guess I'll just go and flush it.
<es>

@87
<en>{Natsume}\n"That's the only one? Are you absolutely sure?"
<es>

@88
<en>She's still scared.
<es>

@89
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It should be fine for now, but they say that if you find one, there must be thirty more hidden in the walls."
<es>

@92
<en>{Natsume}\n"Thirty...................................."
<es>

@93
<en>She was in shock.
<es>

@96
<en>{Natsume}\n".................."
<es>

@97
<en>She sat on the bed, hugging her knees and gazing out into the distance.
<es>

@98
<en>{Kazushi}\n"What are you looking at?"
<es>

@101
<en>{Natsume}\n"A giraffe drowning in debt?"
<es>

@102
<en>She was talking about a stain on the wall. I think she's trying to escape from reality.
<es>

@103
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You have this room to yourself? And you're using the upper bunk?"
<es>

@104
<en>She was choosing to use the top bunk. I know that feeling.
<es>

@105
<en>{Kazushi}\n"It's more fun being on top than on the lower one."
<es>

@108
<en>{Natsume}\n"............"
<es>

@109
<en>We thought surprisingly alike.
<es>

@110
<en>{Natsume}\n"Haruma, you are......"
<es>

@111
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Oh hey, how do you know my name?"
<es>

@112
<en>{Natsume}\n"You were my wet-nurse in a prior life."
<es>

@113
<en>{Kazushi}\n"My prior life!?\nI was a woman?\nI guess that makes sense..."
<es>

@116
<en>{Natsume}\n"What do you mean with 'makes sense'? What can you understand? You're scaring me."
<es>

@117
<en>Wait, I must have had the same name then for her to know what mine is now. That's weird.
<es>

@118
<en>{Kazushi}\n"We both know each other from a previous life? It feels like destiny."
<es>

@121
<en>{Natsume}\n"You're such a fool. I just made that up, of course."
<es>

@122
<en>{Kazushi}\n"You made it up? All that stuff about the previous life thing you were just talking about?"
<es>

@123
<en>{Natsume}\n"How would I know anything about your previous life?"
<es>

@124
<en>{Kazushi}\n"All right......"
<es>

@125
<en>{Kazushi}\n"...wait. Then how do you know my name?"
<es>

@128
<en>{Natsume}\n"I don't know. Stop asking so many questions."
<es>

@129
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Sorry."
<es>

@132
<en>{Natsume}\n"That's enough. I'm going to bed."
<es>

@133
<en>{Kazushi}\n"Fine."
<es>

@134
<en>And just like that she became a grouch. She's a difficult girl, but something about her makes me yearn for a past I can't remember.
<es>

@135
<en>I'm sure I've never been to this island before we started school here, but I feel like I know it from my past. I don't know why I feel like this.
<es>
